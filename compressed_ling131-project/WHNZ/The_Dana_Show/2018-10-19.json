I mean let's just not do that Rick thanks for wedding you're on the market venture been focused and filling in and I go ahead\n[noise] hey Ben thanks for having me on my uh uh really enjoy your show hey thank you had a quick\nQuestion I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down with cancer is but ... from a logical standpoint let us know a few years ago Mr Obama\nFiled federal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the fault her for a view of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument [noise] well no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce the immigration laws some of these states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the uh [noise]\nA sanctuary cities yet\n... it's ... it's because it's when they don't ... people need to understand about liberals\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values they think of that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean that there can millions you liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for piracy\nNo one will ever criticize you for doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day and doing the complete opposite\nThe next day ... ...\n... is the part where I'm confused as is if there's what the court to sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of story to the system stuff like this yet those same courts are stepping back and in reality they're decisions don't stand [noise]\nWell you got to remember we're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it Rick because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and they need to do a quick ... and ... are you at ... I mean look at Ted Cruz a perfect example with his bed to race if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done\nAbsolutely absolutely and and you could argue that there there there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never gonna win California well if you can turn\nTexas to them for the Dems those three states ... it's\nVirtually impossible to do math that makes it were a Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just get the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you got it the same way that you have it in California the same exact way\nBy the way we've got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious commentator she was just on MSNBC\nDeadline White House\nAnd she had some very um insightful words and commentary and analysis about the two thousand mid term to make the midterms elections here is Rosie O'Donnell the liberal of the day with some great advice and analysis for this upcoming election listen to this\nHe's doing that the scare up and journalists care who you call that any of the people as we all know he's doing that right here's a guy who was tortured and killed a journalist who was badly have passed and\nHe doesn't respond why I'm sure that's just what three to think what could have possibly do for their journalists from not printing bad news about him which is also equivalent to the truth about him\nSo now Donald Trump wants to kill American journalists\nI mean we're almost to that point and I that I mean and that has been kind of what I've seen sort of over and over and over\nA first off this [noise]\nI mean like I said this is new launched but nuances dead so it's like you can't even have an honest conversation about any of it I'm just I I look at it like this if the if the Saudi prince which don't do it by this guy why do you feed the trolls man why not just ignore him\nAlthough I Do think it was weird it's weird to me because ... was ... alliance or associate with the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd Saudi Arabia hates the Muslim Brotherhood and I remember in Egypt before the revolution Hillary Clinton was totally behind the Muslim Brotherhood and Muslim Brotherhood had been banned there for a long time 'cause they were extremist and\nThey didn't want anything to do with them and then when Hillary Clinton got involved and endorsed one of the guys that have been a little weird you know what I mean they've got a little sketch\nSo she that was under the Obama administration they're completely just messing everything up I Will say this this administration is nothing like the previous and that the previous would have already been over there to try to do something to get behind you know\n... trying to really have some sort of effect a and get involved in metal and foreign policy that's why I think it's so hysterical some of the criticisms that I see on this administration because for crying out loud this administration back a dictator in Honduras\nThey tried to really disrupt Honduran government and Honduran elections let's not forget about what they did in Libya let's not forget about what they did with Egypt and how they backed the previously banned Muslim Brotherhood creating all sorts of hell and contributing to that hot mess\nOr I could go to I mean in theory I could go on and on and on so they have in terms of uh any kind of I mean it's sort of a joke that that the previous president received a Nobel Peace prize which was apparently as I understand it predicated on the fact that he got people from different countries to talk so big Whoopi at just due to and nobody cares\nBut [noise] I look how many wars in she started in countries you you served in government to destabilized in the process oh and by the way it when they could have went and got involved in something like Iran the green revolution they pretended that wasn't even happening to the Iranian National Guard was\nOr [noise] excuse me revolutionary guard which was was shooting people from rooftops\nAnd they ignored when Russia annexed Crimea so\nIt was just weird how it's almost like the people that\nThis balance of power had tipped away from up on the entrance of the new administration is almost like they're trying to get it flip back\nSee there's a lot of stuff's going into this show and there's a lot more about the the ... situation and oh here's a guy who wrote for the Washington Post that was murdered possibly murder by Saudi operative um\nAnd there's a lot more politics and activism and all kinds of stuff there that's that's involved with it but the thing like I said that that I think is\nIs asinine is if this Saudi prince this\nA crown prince was really bothered by this guy the way that you don't do it is to be really public can do it in Turkey\nBecause turkey would love nothing more than just the Saudi Arabia screw up you definitely don't do it in a sample you definitely don't do it with people that are in your inner circle that are easily identifiable because they're seen with you whenever you travel including to the United states and within the United states it's just not the way you do it I'm not saying that there's a proper way to go and\nYou know a fascinating one because it's wrong but I'm saying if you're trying to be therapists just about it that the stupidest way to go about doing it\nI mean that's just the way it is [noise] but at the same time you know looking at the relationship the United states has relationship with Saudi Arabia it's not like the end be real\nWe don't have a lot of options over there we're going to settle set up to Iran we don't get friendly with Russia I thought wait we're not supposed to like them right isn't that how it goes [noise]\nI mean in Iran and Russia are thick as thieves there there one in the same essentially because of the the deals that they had the trade deals that they have with each other and Russia has Iran's back so do the same way that he does with a ... year Russia has a ... back in Syria so\nIt's all a power play Russia wants to be a kingmaker so that they can have control over the region meanwhile the United states has been allied with Saudi Arabia and they really would love to see this reform are made out to not be a reformer which is why he doesn't himself zero favors if something\nLike this happen right and at the same time what how I mean we're we're we're ... alliances he um was a legal resident of the United states lived in London and and uh as simple as I understand it went to the Saudi embassy in Istanbul which he was there seven minutes before it was it was reported that he was killed [noise]\nUm he had previous alliances with the Muslim Brotherhood that apparently angered the crown prince as well um and he wrote things I'm undermining uh with the er or criticizing what the crown prince was doing\nSo there is it it's not and then that you know Mike Pompeo goes over there to have a conversation and you have the media that loses their ever loving mind because like Wallace here because they think he's being used as a ... he's a damn diplomat who is it represented the United states and going over to have discussions with someone to find out hey did you kill somebody\nHow these people think is going to happen pot pales going to go over there and be like hey ground\nTo cut him up what's up did you did you drop him up over in ... how ... how did it happen\nDiplomacy it's why it's not meant for ... hey it's it's an art I could not be a diplomat do you know why because I feel like blowing smoke up people's backsides and I can only be nice to someone I don't like for so long I mean I'm going to be real with you it takes a lot of energy for me to politely smile\nOh ... ... ...\nSee what I'm saying is I can never be a diplomat a lot of these people can be diplomats because they're simply dumb\nIt's just the the bottom line they uh were talking about his last column ... uh ... Washington Post as last call in with the Arab world needs now is free expression and our media over here has they're really they're pushing the story because they're looking at at it as a way to indict Donald Trump\nThey're pushing the story because they want to say that the Saudi prince was inspired by Donald Trump's words were in he's dead fake news is the enemy of the people and then the press lie to but to everybody and said oh no you said the president the enemy of the people\nAnd then they present these these you know botched soundbites where he you get half of a ... not even half of a full sentence because they're desperately trying to make it out is though he declared war on depressed\nWhen ultimately it was the price of declared war on Donald Trump and as I was discussing this morning on Fox and friends it's really a lot of the chattering class that has declared war on the people who support this administration\nHe simply said fake news as the enemy of the people I think fake news is the enemy of the republic and [noise] and do an insane that he accurately called them up for what they're doing but I made the mad because they don't they don't want to deal with that so here we are\nSo they're trying to blame this on him they're saying the New York times says the president has cow town into a mad prints I don't see how and waiting for details to come in but this is how this is what they are pushing they're trying to make this to focus for midterms instead of the care of and\n[noise] and thought I don't think I Want to do that I\nMean good grief like they have zero self awareness it's just amazing to me there of self awareness\nWe have a a lot\nIncluding the latest so Claire McCaskill you know she is really not happy\nWith that\nProject their tossed expos they were and she was she refuses to clarify a ... I guess I'm assuming her staffers right when he says she absolutely supports a ban on all ...\nRifles we've reached out came right no clarification so I guess she does All right let's kick it an equivalent\nProducers five [noise] well the thing of treasury employers charge were sending sensitive financial reports to a journalist [noise] this was a discharge yesterday leaking confidential information related to special counsel Bob Mueller's probe [noise]\nNatalie in may flowers sewer Edwards a senior advisor at the treasury department's financial firms and forced Mitt network charged with disclosing suspicious activity reports on on a denser vide reporter beginning last year [noise] and they all focused on Manafort to look at that\nThese are these people that have been put in these ah the chicken or rolls and they're the ones who are undermining the ... the administration the deep state do satellite imagery share the shows that Russia is appearing to upgrade for his military installations in a coal Leningrad in Russia's strategic outposts on NATO's doorstep right\nThere between poll a right there are a in a in between pulling in a while in Poland right below Lithuania on the Baltic states\nIt's um it's sandwich directions right between hole and it's a it's a Russian territory that situated right there right on the right on this little peninsula right between pulling in the Baltics and it's not really connected with Russia Russia they call it a non played\nA but it's been the focal point of a lot of tension and so now there appears to be satellite imagery of some build up going on there [noise]\nThat that was done good I'd just as I'm Talking about you don't let them get day a foothold in there [noise]\nSo bloom house the ah ah\nMovie directing the movie company ... production there behind paranormal activity and get out and things like that uh the company's founder Jason's lung told ... that they are trying to hire women but there aren't a lot of female directors out there and all the social justice warriors got really mad because there aren't [noise]\nMoving on to this is just so tired of that and an old man which I ... where did we get to the princess crap oh my gosh yes we have that today too so amazing to me tell you also did um [noise]\nThere was this hill about a on a hill piece about John James he's West Point grad combat vet and he's a running for his ... Senate candidate the hill says in this piece that\nThe Michigan candidate apologized Tuesday because critics pointed out that their looks like what is what appears to be a swastika and a brief appearance of one of his campaign ad it was him to a bulletin board in a school hallway [noise]\nThat was featured in the ad so he went to a school and he was he was shooting at that and it happened to be up on a bulletin board in this hallway\nHe said well it was a terrible error on our part because we didn't catch it and he goes I'll make sure that ever happened again I mean for crying out loud it was in a school on a bulletin board they were using it as a lesson\nPeople chill the hell out and so now you have all of these idiotic media people who are lecturing him I don't think he us combat that going to need your all's lecturing on fighting oppression so maybe just stop for a little bit [noise]\nWe have more on the way we have that coming up we have a also the latest with a Texas and what is I Would hate to Disney Princess with it\n\nWhen it comes to hiring there are jobs I set send you tons of the wrong resumes to sort through that's not smart you know it's also not smart using

somebody in my campaign [noise] um if the attorney general of the state of Missouri is supposed to be going after fraud\nNot participating in it and so um there was nothing there I've been very upfront about all my positions [noise] in fact now I remember that very individual talking to me [noise]\nTrying to get me to say\nTrying to get me to tell him to say something different than what my positions are and I said no you just got to tell people on the doors it is what it is I've made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment and universal background checks and banning bump stocks my gun record is out in the open for everyone to see\nShe actually said assault weapons ban and then her staffer says yes she does support a ban on some at a Mac rifles and that's what she is desperate to avoid discussing a Josh Hawley responded and said senator accusing people of crimes as a serious thing if you have evidence of a crime please come forward with it immediately otherwise please stop politicizing the legal process for your reelection\n[noise] I think it's pretty insane that she was caught on tape literally saying the truth about her position\nShe blames Josh Hawley for it because I guess she thinks that he works with James O'Keefe which that's not even true yeah you're confused can we can views about I'm confused or if it's fraud\nBut she did nothing but explained her positions that she's been public about already\nHow was it for a ... yeah\nBecause you got in trouble because her staff is saying oh yeah we totally take money from Planned Parenthood and all that stuff that's not what she dressing and the oh no no she doesn't want to ... she's trying to spend as desperately I just think it's a weird she's so desperate to avoid talking about it that she blames the AG she blames Josh Hawley her Republican opponent\nThat's just dumb\nI mean can be really Frank for a minute and I do not mean any disrespect to either Josh Hawley or James O'Keefe so do not look at it in that context but let let's be real\nJames O'Keefe is a barn burner that's what he does\nJosh Hawley is a super serious lawyer [noise]\nJosh ... is is interested Josh Hawley and I don't I've never met him in person ever\nI've only ever spoken to him\nOn this program and then I had one phone call with him prior to him coming on this program um 'cause every now and then I'll do that I'll just just so I can hear a guest voice and just say you know thanks for coming on I Do this with some of my guests can can attest\nThat the I have never spoken to him outside of that ever ever if you were if something were to happen and used to paint on my phone records and you look at all my tax and everything I haven't never spoken to this dude ever\nSaid that one call before he first came on\nAnd there was like a couple of minutes and we mostly talked about you know when I moved from Missouri and then asked him you know about his family and then of course where did you go to high school because it's like a thing anyway but my whole point is that the accusation that he was somehow involved in this\nIs even dumb or when you look at the behavior of both because James is a barn burner and he will jump into the fray\nHolly is a very serious studious lawyer\nAnd I'll be real I think that I think that she is so he is everything that a Democrat like Claire McCaskill would fear Josh Hawley he\nHolly very much support the Trump Administration and he very much is is in line with the immigration with the tax reform with the trade manufacturing et cetera\nBut he is very uh he's a law and order right he's super serious and I think that's a negative for him he's just not shrill and over the top he's not\nHe he's you know pretty laid back I mean he'll he'll get bought when he needs to but he's just lay back and he wants to get it done\nAnd while people are running around waving their arms trying to distract from one identity politics tactic to the next he just gets it done and that almost kind of goes against him because a lot of people view that as an mistakenly I think there's a lack of charisma and it's not that he doesn't have charisma it's just that he is very serious\nAnd I'm not making this comparison either but I'm just saying no one would sit here and be like John Wayne isn't charismatic he just says no charisma because he's so serious no one would ever say that\nGo to lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop\n\nWar machine one bumps and\nWelcome back to the Dell wants the radio show this is Lynn ... successful real estate investor and lifestyles unlimited mentor Jillian darling and today we've been working on your financial freedom with a conversation about harnessing your fear to drive change and future success\nWe've talked about some some tips to harness that fear so so we talked today about all of the things that cause and generate that fear the things that are working for you when you look toward your retirement and\nIt is that stress that inability to sleep you know your head hits the pillow at night and that's when all the worries come\nAnd that's bubbling up from your subconscious telling you\nIt's time to change because you're not going to get where you want to go things are not working it's that got level feeling that something has to change or life is not going to be what you want it to be\nAnd we talked about the first tool to harness your fear is education and we're not asking you to suspend all reason and logic\nEducation's a powerful tool to overcome fear and that's why ... founded lifestyles unlimited we're an education and mentoring company we don't put deals together we don't ask people to give us their money we teach you you had to go out and do what we have successfully done\nAnd I think that's the the biggest tip you gave Chilean is that when you're trying to harness\nInstead of letting it each you alive get educated and you're already educated and all kinds of things you're credibly successful but get educated in this area\nSo that you can create the wealth and passes income you want for retirement that you want to kill and some other things that we can do to harness beer and drive change and future success with it instead of letting fear to swallow his whole\nSo\nI think that fear essentially stems from the unknown and the easiest way to conduct the unknown is\nThrough education as we've talked about so the more educated that you get\nThe more education that has the ability to make the unknown the new normal it makes it something that you become comfortable with and then it like riding a bike and then you have the fear again because you have to get out of your comfort zone and do something else\nBut you already have the foundation for with the education that you've taken to that point so it can propose to the next up\nAnd you know I think that the biggest misconception that I hear is people think that we're telling\nIndividuals to scrap everything you know liquidated everything\nCash out of all of the things that you've been saving for and you've been taught at the Safeway and investing your entire life and that's just not true real estate is not one size fits all you can move as quickly or is slowly as you want to\nIronically I Am one of those individuals that want it to move very slowly I Am a I'm going to put my ... in the water to check out the temperature I Am not the I'm going to cannon ball into the deep end right off the bat\nBut as a result I put my should be telling the water temperature was good\nTook the first ... seconds before you knew it I was swimming in the deep end and I didn't even realize how I got there so I made that fear of change are being uncomfortable\nA success pattern so that's kind of where it goes from there the other thing that I Can't stress enough it's never be afraid to ask questions\nSo I'm One of the church here with lifestyles unlimited and I will not lie to you and tell you that I Know every single thing there is to know about the economy and real estate and everything that you could ever possibly know and anybody that tells you they can is full of it do you want somebody that is just as nervous\nAbout the situation that they don't know the answer to helping you because the person that's nervous or the person that is a little afraid of change or a little a little bit of fear of the unknown as well that's the person that you want on your bike 'cause that's the person that's going to research it and go down that rabbit hole of gloom and doom and find the answer that you need\nSo I get off the numbers all the time because they don't want to disclose to me when something is going wrong and I'm saying no tell me you're not going to change anything\nIn your situation if you don't take the option of asking for help we're here to throw life best and gets you out of situations that help you were giving advice and tell you hey you need to take a left you need to take a write in a way going back to your point about driving home and the road being locked because it's overcome with water\nLifestyles unlimited if your GPS system we are the ones that say hey whoa whoa whoa turn around don't drown we need you to take a left right now we're going to get your home safely um it's going to be a different route but it's going to be much better so that helped people need to start looking at it um\nI also encourage people to take their time and make sure that this is what they want to do you know there's nothing worse than an impulsive individual that just changes everything in their life and\nThen it wouldn't Gratz later on so you have to know yourself and know what you're capable of taking on and like I said the biggest tool that we offer is a strong education a tried and true it's hot but it's been tested time and time again\nOver the course of the twenty eight years with this company has been in existence\nI always recommend emulating people that are successful that you want to be like you don't want to be like the person that you know lost all their money when they were doing flips or that guy's neighbors friends rather than we had talked about earlier that how 'bout rental one time Twenty years ago and had a bad experience with it\nDon't account for advice that guy's going to give you all the wrong at ...\n... people that are successful and what they do ask people that are confident in their abilities to know the answers and if they don't know the answer is that they will find the answers so it's a it's a\nContinuing education process and that's where it's fantastic because I always want to grow I Want to expand my thought processes I Want to be able to know what it is going to happen in the future and be prepared for it\nThough it's a continuing education but it's a lifelong education and not the exciting part about real estate because things do change and\nWe're prepared for them based on our experiences in our ability to have dealt with change initially\nAnd I think that goes for way as it goes for anything that we do in life right uh you know being able to um to get educated\nSurround yourself with success ask questions and be transparent find a mentor who successfully done what you want to do the way you want to do it and then take action walk through that fear Jillian today shows coming to an end\nBut fortunately everyone can find us any day of the week morning or night on dial on the radio dot com for pod cast this is Len row with Jillian Carlin thank you for spending some time with us today we look forward to talking with you again soon remember it's not the money and so my style\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nWell I'm sure\nYour dream to want to go on the dot com mom we really enjoy

attractive and the New York times had this piece that they ran on the fourteenth where they said well he I mean he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and\nHe was an Islamist and he had um you know would seek a and use anti western rhetoric\nAnd and and\nThings such as you know things like that and he had also apparently previously worked as a an advisor and an unofficial spokesman for the royal family and I\nI'm also interested in what made him an attractive hired of the Washington Post\nWhy did the Washington Post hire him\nUm he he's pro Palestinian and Saudi Arabia meanwhile has expressed support for the state of Israel so they're at odds there there are at odds over political Islam there at odds over a number of things and so he's taken out [noise] and so\nTo talk to doctors any jazz or about this because I think it's just really stupid and narrow minded to say that investigating this further is somehow conducting a ... you're conducting a whisper campaign\nThis is again people don't want any research or any questions or any facts to come into play just like if someone is if someone is accused of of sexual harassment or assault well let's just the accusation that the evidence so\nIt's more than that and then our third our Louie Gohmert is going to join us to discuss this mob of migrants this caravan that is leaving Honduras in moving through I think what they are in Guatemala right now is that where they are the my the caravan\nYou can't use the same mob mob is bad you can't\nSo we'll get into all of that and ah and more uh additionally additionally I was just a beta or war you know they had the CNN town hall last night [noise]\nAnd it was just a beta Robert or work town hall and they had said that they and they had invited Ted\nCruz and Ted Cruz's people released our correspondents or the ... campaign said well why don't you just turn this into a debate\nWould gladly you know ... why don't you turn this into a debate but seeing and didn't want to do that and so cruises like as senior town halls and that we're not doing this I can tell you about their town halls and so it was him being weird\nAnd so he was\nAsked also about and he pulled us up among my hair he was asked specifically\nAbout impeaching Trump and you remember when the kids even before he started his you know the Senate campaign he had said that he would vote to impeach Trump and then at the last debate [laughter] he said he would impeach Trump\nSo after he said he would work with him ... well now he was trying to go for he he wouldn't answer the question actually right away listen to this because he was asked about this again listen\nYou've already said [noise] even though that's not done that you would vote to impeach and so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed the crime of treason primer bribery or a high crime in misdemeanor [noise] which one of those do you think the president has committed [noise]\nAre with like in the impeachment tunes are there there was enough there to proceed with the ... for a full voting of the facts\nAnd to make the best informed decision and the interest of this country and our future as you know under the constitution as a member of the sun it's it's a far different bar that as a trial with more coal years where we look at the facts I Would not be in George the outcome of that for\nOkay\n... well yeah what was the answer and she said to her credit\nPressed and kept moving ... kept pushing forward on it\nUh that's Dana Bash such a her credit she was you know she caught him she was like well Mm no he didn't actually heads of the questions even reminded him she goes congressman uh the question was about impeachment and you said in July that you would as a member of the

us\nAnd it's great to be really Dana thanks for having me\nGet some perspective on this because I you know I I find it hard to believe that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia would decide to because he had hurt feelings over something that\nA ... you wrote about in his columns that he would carry out an assassination in broad daylight ah where his people and his inner circle would be caught on closed circuit TV entering the consulate\nAnd just over over the column I mean there seems to be a lot more here I'm ... is is that an accurate way to kind of view the situation\nAlthough certainly a lot more of their and it is is just baffling to me to see the\nGyrations that the left media the legacy media is doing in this story which is all of a sudden they've taken a guy\nWho you know under any other planet or would be I'm surprised they even had a resident visa ear and out of the Washington Post as line I think him and making him into a hero and they haven't really looked at his

an activist so but we should not be a glossy glassy eyes on exactly what this guy was all about and what was the about well I'll remind you of three or four months ago the Saudis put into sort of a detention and the Ritz Carlton and all of the the royal family that was involved with the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo they took basically a trillion dollars that had been used globally for the last fifty years where the Saudis had been funding Muslim Brotherhood operations around the planet\nThe last six months they put a stop to that part of the lead of that was allowed in will lead who owns a center at Georgetown has owned the a center at Harvard et cetera which has been radicalized Muslims in the west but one of the close friends of will lead is ...\n... came to America a year ago there's no doubt that the princes folks want it to bring the show again for interrogation and another thing so odds are that went sour odds are like many other dictatorships on my only knows the Syrian one pretty well\nThey're pretty ruthless bugs and they may have just gone south but the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American\nVery anti Israel the Saudis shifted than the last six months decided to become more pro Israel is isn't real reforms it's more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million was starting to write more and more critical against the Saudis and they probably wanted to contain him\nAll that and the and that would make sense of the New York times had a piece I just a few days ago where they wrote about his membership in the Muslim Brotherhood which is why I thought it was so weird that the Washington Post that it
