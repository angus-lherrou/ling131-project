I saw as like\nThey had sent a spokesperson are are sent someone over an eight or something to the group that were just very sweetly assembled and they were like no you're not getting there it was it was pretty unbelievable\nTo watch it it is the complete definition of white privilege the fact that you have the media who is running defense for this white woman who appropriated\nAn ethnicity for personal gain and she did and the reason this is so much bigger than Warren too by the way I really just want to emphasize that this there's there's an undercurrent story here there's a because it she Indian identity\nThe politics I\nThink about this for a moment can you what are your kids going as for Halloween all your parents that have young kids out there my youngest son's dressing up for Halloween [noise] remember the story\nThat I shared you share it with you was the last year last October about the little girl that wanted to dress up like on the on off from the princess and the frog\nAnd her mom got her the green down and she got her the whole costume and the little girl was like nope not good enough\nI she she thought that princess T on as dark color skin was beautiful and she wanted to have that again and she told her mom this isn't good enough\nSo her mom obliged and she did body makeup on her daughter and everyone begin attacking the kid on Facebook seemed a little girl was in black face and it was racist\nAnd that's why we had a big discussion like is it raised us so because she's not doing it to make a show of it to market like she wanted I mean should the little girl was like four years old three or four years old she wanted to do it because she thought that was the prettiest\nAnd she wanted to be the prettiest for Halloween\nAnd everyone was showing their own little head space that they wouldn't stop and consider for just a moment first off this little kid has no idea what racism is that you all projecting your baggage on her it's taught\nAnd secondly she wanted to be the most beautiful thing in the world and she thought it was princes piano and her her beautiful dark skinned and that's what she wanted to dress up as an all the barbarians on Twitter and Facebook we got attacking her mom works was mostly on Facebook attacking her mom and a and and attacking the kid\nAnd then finally other people stepped up and we're like okay this is kind of ridiculous now\n\nIs this a dangerous is what I'm Talking about so that you think about your kids how many of\nYou have little girls who who maybe one or to dress up like Pocahontas or maybe your kids are older now but you have little girls that wanted to dress up like Pocahontas or maybe even princess T ana\nThey can't do that now because you're going to be called racist even though people who are saying that you have no idea what the hell it means when used in this context because trying to be like something because you admire\nIt is legit the opposite of racism\nBut people are stupid\nBut you can't do that I share the story with you I think I'm going to bring this back up because they mentioned this on Twitter and nobody believes me and I so I had to go back and be like F. Y. yeah do you remember when we had the story of the sorority that had to end at taco Tuesday\nBecause they\nIt was deemed offensive\nIs that it was offensive taco Tuesday was offensive it was a sorority and I thought it was fun\nAnd they love tacos and you know it's cetera but they were told that because they enjoyed\nTacos that they were somehow uh being racist\nAnd so they had to end their taco Tuesday the sorority as California State University Fullerton they had to stop their taco Tuesday I think they said they said you're all the ... year old being racist\nSet a sorority says well look we've never ask people to wear costumes and you know some people were ... but it wasn't people love the food and they love the culture and that's the whole thing well then you had the whole world culture not a costume program\nAnd\nThey had to stop it so you can't do that your kids can't dress up as Pocahontas or princess she ana you can't have taco Tuesday you can't do anything like that but\nA white woman up in Massachusetts can lie inappropriate and ethnicity and you all are supposed to look the other way 'cause she got that Democrat white privilege\nAnd that's exactly what it is\nJust crazy that\nThat is I mean as I did have identity politics jumped the shark and I think that's the big question right now\nNo lives with one was on Twitter earlier and she says millions of people watch the real Donald Trump is you fumbled in lied on your one million dollar pledge\nAnd then it took and then took a day for your handlers to tee up this recycled racist name a name calling you've lost a step\nOkay yeah I don't think that you know what and I responded because I was like you're you're white or the most European Americans in you purposely changed how you identify your ethnicity if you could take advantage of diversified hiring if that isn't race is not racist nothing is\nSo you have now you have Cherokee Nation out there the spokesperson\nWell that the secretary the Cherokee Nation secretary state Chuck ... junior he got out there he didn't like what the president said he really didn't like what what Elizabeth Warren did he said it was inappropriate and wrong you heard the soundbite\nHe said it was ... it ... should not be doing this said should not be doing this they released a statement just slamming her\nThey the statement that they as you said that uh\nThe great majority of her identifiable ancestry is European\nAnd\nShe hit back at them she actually trying to argue with literal actual Indians the statement that they really set a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person to ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set up their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing a DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to Cherokee Nation or tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's a legitimate uses\nWhile also dishonor rain legitimate tribal government and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and he was heritage is prove\nA Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nI mean she's not plan or they're not playing with her\nSo they're saying no that's not going to work but when everyone else says that it's racism so it was a white woman going to call Cherokee Nation racist I'm waiting like what do you do white liberals are white progressive because I think liberals and progressives are different what do I progressive do what do you guys do now\nWe have a lot more coming up including sassy Lindsey Graham I Love me since ... he says you know what I think I'm going to take a DNA test due to see if I got more Native American heritage and Elizabeth Warren does will discuss that will also get into how the media is be clowning itself\nBecause they are the media does in this\nAnd ran like they were the cavalry come into coming to protect her a and later on James that keep joined us at the bottom of the hour to discuss in Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill hidden agenda\nWhat does she actually stand for perhaps that's something voters should know I don't know [noise]\nSo we're going to get into that and so much more in the meantime I worked out today where it was at the gym this morning and as always part of my pre workout includes super beach because it's loaded with dietary nitrates which kick start nitric oxide production in the body and that's what increases or your circulation and maintains that blood pressure\nA healthy blood pressure and you know

called her horse race in a tweet\nNow we can sit here and have the conversation as to whether or not it's appropriate for a president to call a woman who does resemble Sarah Jessica Parker a horse race or it's a long running joke get mad or we could you know just do it it's Donald Trump ... what did you seriously think you were going to get\n... honestly people are like can you believe you did this and I'm all like why do you think people voted for him that's why it was kicking and of course I\nDidn't want to do this five [noise]\nSo um ... what's her face ... Kristen cinema [noise] right [noise] cinema she's the one is going up against stomach Sally in Arizona [noise]\nThrough this story with her gets crazier and crazier says she was at first like mocking but she was going after ah\nAh [noise] voters and and and Arizona and she was saying that Arizona was like Messi and all kinds of stuff\nSo now they're emails that show that she even invited which is to her anti war rally so after she was caught on video send a bunch of disparaging things about Arizona Arizona voters now the Democrat nominee for us then it just is like what's her face Christine O'Donnell when she was like I'm not a which I knew\nShe actually said that so I Wonder if Christine O'Donnell for one Halloween [noise] ah but ... Christ in cinema the Democrat nominee for US Senate she says I'm not a witch but she didn't invite them to her anti war rally show emails\nThis I have so many ... just loads for this\nBeta Robert or

well I still think he might be considering something anyway smoking gun says cops are suspect that they had this woman this crazy lady she uh apparently chewed an air crack pipe to try to hide it from cops as they approached [noise] yeah that's yeah\nThat's not going to work and the suspect had only ... she does well coming up James or keep joined us to discuss Claire McCaskill [noise]\nHave you

Associated Press has been because\nRemember how I was telling you the media was just going all in on this end book clowning itself or the Warren thing the reason that I'm bringing this up is because I think it's so much more than just her eyes are we at the end of identity politics do you think\nOr no I mean there's a legitimate question are we at the end of it or net\nSo let me see why you think that over think about it for real [noise] let me show you this Associated Press so they went they went and hard on this pay\nThey were treating all of this morning as Elizabeth Warren was tweeting all of this morning and they said that uh the first week was a\nPresident Trump lashes out at Senator Warren\nOver a DNA test result she released indicating she has Native American heritage and he says her claims are scam an ally despite her proof\nHer proof Christine Blasey Ford had more proof her proof [noise] oh my heavens [noise] uh\nYeah no and so then they deleted it they say we delayed it a tweet with President Trump's reaction to senator warns claim of Native American heritage because elect context and new to it as coming\nProof\nProved that she's actually less Native American by blood than the average white person is what she did that is what she proved she actually proves she's less than most people\nThe appropriation of an ethnicity for gain and we've talked about this and in fact later on in the program Cherokee genealogist twyla barns that everybody MSNBC CNN\nIt all try to ignore because she's been one of the longest critics of Elizabeth Warren this goes back to the Scott Brown racing twenty twelve I'm wearing it first came out through the Boston Globe and\nShe ... Barnes actually went and looked over her family tree went back for records and it was from twyla barns that we got the ... that we got the um the update on it that she had no actual\nA Native American associations going even way back but the closest that she did come\nIs that she apparently help to round up I'm a\nNative Americans in Georgia on Jackson's trail of tears so she's trying to prepare for a Senate race or effort not really Senate race but I think she's trying to put herself\nPosition herself as a contender and what's going to be very crowded a raise the progressive\nDrama queen people like Kamala Harris and Cory Booker analysis Warren there's not really a serious candidate and there and Elizabeth Warren is showing that with this tactic she doesn't really have\nGood political chops and or does she have really good um I just don't think our political argument is good enough but I like it because it I mean for granted that we got two days out of this and she keeps tripling down on it so we have more to get into with\nThis um including what the president said about her and the latest because Cherokee nation's not taking this lying down they're mad a\nAnd we'll get into all of that speaking of another senator in St Louis Missouri Claire McCaskill is in the toughest race of her life politically uh this is a senator and everybody knows my long\nHistory with her she hates me with the burning passion of a thousand suns she screamed at me at press conferences before I mean screamed at me and she is always try to position herself as a moderate except she's been she was a rubber stamp on the previous administration and she's got ... ... ... more progressive\nBut she tries to hide it from voters and she is struggling because Missouri's the state that went by Trump double digit and Missouri is the state where you have so many moderate Democrats blue collar Democrats voted for Trump\nAnd they're really disillusioned with ... with the Democrat Party and with people like McCaskill says she was very quiet if you notice she was very quiet on Kavanaugh she's been very quiet on gun issues she said very quiet\nOn a lot of stuff well at least publicly but she did talk to project very Todd unknowingly\nBecause they were embedded within her campaign and it was very interesting I think the first time by is of Senator McCaskill that this was part of the the the Q and a that this undercover reporter had with her listen [noise]\n\nYeah I'm On she had but the thing that she's always kind of triangulate on is where she stands on quote\nUnquote assault weapons 'cause she said before I supported assault weapons ban will remember that the go that's the word that they all use it to catch all phrase for some automatic firearms semi automatic rifle specifically that they would like all ... to be banned uh and so her staff are actually spoke to this odd in another video listen\nWe know you're out there hiding in plain sight living a life of\nQuiet desperation wondering if you're going to beat your money to the grave there's a better way a better life and lifestyles unlimited it's time to live the life you deserve you can only do that by creating passive income let a show you how it's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mindless night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop duck\nWill come back more than the men on a mission to remember the one\nBack with Adele wants a radio show this is Len Merlin today we'd been working on your financial freedom during our conversation with Peggy in Leo and how they've distinguish some of the timeless life lessons that'll help us succeed I'm from the ideas that we need to transform\nIn order to make our dreams and our desires of reality and so they grew up in entrepreneurial families ah Peggy grew up with some some belief systems about I'm being debt free very common in in some entrepreneurial families\nI'm Leo grew up with commercial real estate seeing the power of real estate but never really being taught the power of real estate\nAnd they both ended up in corporate jobs um and doing a variety of things Peggy made her way to the top and and retired pretty much when her her salary cap to Leo had his own business\nAnd that didn't want to grow it any further it has to end at some point unless you just want to work in the business until the day you die unless you're going to create a huge team and then manage that team and it wasn't something Li I wanted to do\nAnd so now with all this life experience they found themselves and you know looking out on on to the rise in uncharted territory and cast about a little bit and we're really looking for something in during something where they can find their place in the world\nWhere they could use the things they that they had learned and transform\nAll of that and to a great retirement living the life they wanted which didn't include managing people\n... working in a business right Leo I'm so tell us a little bit out about the results you've had you know you you joined lifestyles unlimited you've been members for a couple of years now and talk to us about how your life is now\nAnd what you're doing on a day to day basis as a result\nLynn I I Love it I mean we don't have to worry about fighting the traffic [laughter] um we uh you know we office out of our homes um\nWe just have kind of a piece about is um the thing about it we have learned a skill set on how to invest in apartment complexes and I never dreamed I always thought if you are going to be a passive investor in an apartment that you had to be there an institutional investor\nOr from the very wealthy family and we're not on a more small guys and actually we're in an apartment complex that you know almost like eight hundred unit I mean we're tiny Crispin attraction in the deal but we've been able to get into that deal and and really I mean\nI think about if one of the guts to couldn't work or maybe both of us that the money that we're making the passive income keeps coming in so we don't have to worry about that because there's somebody leading the projects delayed investor which I think in the industry most\nFirms column sponsor investors they're taking care of everything there they're finding the apartment complex they're managing it are finding somebody to manager for them so we just have a certain paste about us than we know we're we're going and and really\nAs we get into details and we briefed by um the deal then\nThat means that like let's say I'm just doing\nAn arbitrary figure let's say we put a hundred thousand and we might on a ... I get the hundred thousand back we might get a percentage a smaller percentage of it we might even get a bigger percentage of it and so we're still in that deal we're still making that\nThat income in that deal but we're able to use the money from the ... to get into more gills so our first year we were able to get into an\nApartment complex as well now we've had as many as like Seventeen complexes that were invested in and that's the churning effect of the ...\nAre are selling and so we right now we own sixteen because we've sold one and that was the situation where we did what they call it in thirty one exchange and that's where\nYou had we had a complex\nAnd we tried it up and in this case we tried it up to two more complex as well okay so let's say we could a hundred thousand in that first um\nApartment complex there's an investment well we had an equity gain or Seventy one percent so when we do that first complex and tried it up into two\nMore complex as we had now a hundred and Seventy one thousand to invest and we didn't really even have to put a penny into the deal that we handed over it was already in there\nWe went from a complex to close to two hundred thousand too too complex which total about um\nA five hundred unit I think the two hundred thousand and we went from a complex with two hundred units too too complex that equal five hundred unit and so what that means there's the cash flow increases and um we changed like it it was\nOn one of 'em they occupancy was eighty three percent and the late investors gotten that up to Ninety three percent and then on the other conflicts that we tried it into we found out that oracle was moving within a half mile of our investment and they were bringing in five thousand employs\nSo it it's just been great were so excited about it [noise]\nLeo and what is it good for you now how is it how has it changed your life what are you doing day to day now that you weren't doing that for\nThem you know funny or just the other day\nI remember about it and it was oh west or their order\nAnd it was maybe about ... park after I'd gotten up at eight thirty instead of getting up but you know six o'clock Wal Mart and um but but and I'm like or you know why they do and thought I said you know any of your gas\nBut here I Am but not very far off at ... such a beautiful ...\nGasoline I Do what I Want\nI Want a little more ... and I thought you know all about my former certain\nPower those women was warmer half a mile a I'm\nA ... a comeback and then you know and then there's a really they\nOffer coverage or ... or at least on the Internet you can look up some markets and stuff and um\nAnd then also what you are a lot going back and talk and call and we'll leave restaurants want to know more about\nYou but if we are right you can do all the things that you love but you're not responsible for making those deals go down and that is wonderful thank you so much for joining me today\nToday shows come to an end fortunately you can find that do on the radio show on the air every day of the week and enjoy our podcasts at Dell on the radio dot com until next time this is Len borough thank you for listening and remember it's not the money it's the lifestyle [noise]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nDream to do more [laughter]\n\n\nThe proceeding was paid program paid for by lifestyles unlimited be opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W H ... am staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated\nWent\nYou want to listen on our three are renting downloading now\nX Y Z or something that someone would use or trade on as a identity politics in the era in in our political realm\nThe left particularly the Democrat Party has tried to patent those things where you can't really support women's rights unless you vote Democrat you can't really be supportive of females unless you vote Democrat\nYou can't really be a strong supporter of the black community unless you vote Democrat\nYou can't be an authentic gay person unless you vote Democrat\nAnd I\nKind of I scratch my head over that because isn't that the opposite of of ... the ability to make a choice\nFreedom of association\nThe idea that if you are X Y or Z you immediately think like this well guess what\nNot all gay people support higher taxes just what not all black people believe that the government should run your healthcare and guess what not all women I think that policies of increasing\nThe individual tax rate is good for America but you're not allowed to have those viewpoints that's how it's always been presented you're not allowed to have those viewpoints\nBecause all you need to know is if you are a woman or if you're black or Hispanic or gay or whatever\nRepublican hate you and you can't vote for them\nWell that's not true but that's what ... Democrats run on\nThey have to run on that because they know if they told people well guess what guys this is what this is our platform\nOr we want a police state and we wanted the police to be a federalized in DC all in one area run out of D.C we want higher taxes we want to increase [noise] ah the tax rate to a forty percent are up\n\nWe want to Jack up taxes on businesses do they have less capital with which to expand and hire more people will want all of your health care to be just like to be I mean when you when they tell you these things that doesn't really in gear anyone to those ideas right [noise]\nSo they have to say well you know maybe you don't like our ideas the Republicans want to kill you\nThey hate you that's the stuff they say it was just insane to me\nAnd a lot of people aren't believing it that's why the whole economy thing that's what this was about ... ... it was a\nCulture war that was about\nIs less about the optics of ...\nAnd really more about here is a very a very powerful very successful black businessman in the public eye who's very vocal who ways all had carries a lot of influence and he's saying things that don't\nGo with the narrative of leftist ideology and that is dangerous and that's why they went at him so hard\nThat's why they went after my friend Bruce Carol [noise] he was he is a successful businessman\nHe is\nRespected in his community\nHe is a gay conservative\nAnd you're not allowed to see those things you know how to be gay conservative you're not allowed to be gay and a Republican you're not allowed to be black in a Republican or black on a conservative or a woman in the conservative and I think what the hell are making these rules if you're not allowed to associate freely\nAnd ask questions\nAre you from are you there\nYeah that's the that's that's what you have to ask are you really free\nAnd the answer is now\nA lotta people are waking up to that\nAnd that's one of the reasons why now you see this this is more than people waking up to bad politics were not at the point yet but we're getting close like how I said Kavanaugh was a watershed moment it was one of the first times that I remember aside from twenty sixteen election\nThat was more about the people making that decision\nKavanaugh was the entire right\nAnd independents libertarians saying enough is enough and they shut down the road rage mob a first time that has ever happened everyone work together and they showed look your tactics don't work\nThey don't work here that was a watershed\nWhere\nPeople who have been told that the color of their skin or their orientation or their sex that determines what party they vote for\nAnd Democrats will say well we're the ones who are really not protections for you well really what are you doing in terms of protections\nYou do a couple of things about bathrooms and you support like pronoun usage but what are you doing for their businesses what are you doing for their health care\nYou're making it harder for them\nYou're you're increasing their taxes you're making it more difficult for women business owners\nLike unemployment's at an all time low that didn't happen under a black president\n\nI mean you could argue when it happened all you want to it happened after tax reform [laughter]\n\nAnd you would think that would have been wonderful to see\nI don't care who's president I Want lower taxes period I Want a healthy economy period but the point is for all of the discussion about catering to specific demographics the party that parade that as their identity the most\nIn terms of foreign policy\nWhen you're really you're really going to work\nAnd and give money to a country like Iran to execute people for being gay\n\nSo this is what I've always you know I and I look at my friend Bruce and now here his social media accounts and that's the privately controlled public square I Know that's kind of a weird for anything but\nHe was suspended because honestly I think it's because he's a gay conservative because he does not say\nI mean there are people who stay horrible things that people who've told me that I should die and that I should be shot their accounts are still out there\nGave patriots has gone Jeremiah Wright\nWho says the most awful hurtful things\nAnd\nThe most anti Semitic\nStuff that I just I'm shocked at\nIt I mean it's like I just want to go it's twenty Eighteen you know ...
