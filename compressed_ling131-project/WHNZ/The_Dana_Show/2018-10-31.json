arguing and then of course there's a huge argument over even the creation of birthright citizenship and anchor babies et cetera and whether that was a John Brennan footnote from something that was entirely aside from any Supreme Court decision\nOr whether it's something that can actually be interpreted from the words that are in the fourteenth amendment\nVi and then there's also the discussion as to whether or not the president can\nUse an executive order to do this and those individuals who don't believe that he can't or the individuals who believe in the very literal as I understand what they're presenting as textural is argument of the constitution saying that he would actually have to go through the proper channels now Lindsey Graham sassy Graham\nIn an effort I think to to half this or to go somewhere halfway um he used to add that heat\nEntirely support the president on this in fact he went off a quite some time on a Twitter about it saying that he has has always opposed birthright citizenship that this is something that he has has a he thinks is insane and he has to the president's remarks\nIntroduced a piece of legislation already to that effect so for those who are going to and I think he's doing that\nTo just to hedge against ah the pushback from others on the right who sent into he's got to go through these channels to do it at cetera et cetera so it comes down to whether or not you really believe that the constitution as being bastard dies or you don't\nAnd I think that's where we are and that's what I'm going to take up what Jake Christian Adams because there's none of the lawyers none of my lawyer friends agree with each other not a single one of my lawyer friends agree with each other\nThey're aggravating living hell outta me today every one of them they're aggravating me not a single one of them agree with each other they're all arguing with each other I met a group taxed with a with a few friends three of whom are attorneys um one is constitutional attorney one you know worked with a a\nA justice criminal the criminal justice et cetera [noise] and it is it is incredibly frustrating because none of them not a single one of them agree with each other and they are arguing about this so that I Wonder if I Want to talk to shake Christian Adams another lawyer is that where he is not in that group tacked to have him\nWalk through and he probably and I don't think he agrees with some of the other individuals that have discussed this out there\nI mean the thing that that really when he talks about doing this with an executive order there are some individuals who say well ... was a huge problem and so how are you going to go and and target jacko because you believe that that was an overreach of executive authority but yet you're going to attempt to change the constitution\nUsing an executive order is that not the same thing and I know some of the folks over at a high um have been a ... in fact I was reading John you this morning who says it's settled law and he's one of those individuals who is\nVery much a he is he is very much against the president actually uh he thinks he believes that it is modifying the constitution without going through the proper channels\nAnd that's kind of he said that the Supreme Court has consistently ride the fourteenth amendment to grant birthright citizenship whether it's the United states if he won't come arc\nUh which was an Eighteen Ninety eight ended up held the American citizenship of a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents who themselves could never naturalized under the Chinese exclusion act or also he writes a court held that the fourteenth amendment affirms the agent and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory any allegiance protection of the country yadda yadda yadda [noise]\nUh then they he side fly larvae do uh where it was a five to four ruling that the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause require taxes to provide public school into children of illegal aliens and all nine justices agreed that quote no plausible distinction with respect to the fourteenth amendment quote jurisdiction and that's what we're gonna come back to\nCan be drawn between resident alien who's entry into the United states is lawful et cetera et cetera et cetera and we talk about a legion so we talk about jurisdiction because people are ... are wanting to define what do you mean by jurisdiction\nIs that does have to have to do with allegiance to one particular country you know et cetera and so\nAnd then there are individuals who absolutely do not believe that this is that this is settled law and they think that it it's not settled law to the point where we need intervention from the from the executive office\nA and that is that is what a lot of that is what it again at a bunch of other lawyers are are and and pundits are arguing\nSo I think it old I I think it comes down to a couple of things uh [noise]\nWhether or not people actually really one thing whether or not individuals believe in the founders it seems to be like a founders intent and people trying to define or redefined word that's kind of what I think it's kind of falling down to and I don't know I'm kind of\nI don't support birthright citizenship\nI don't I just don't I just simply did not I think that um you have to go through I mean everyone should go through proper channels and and by the way\nDean of the mind that you support lawful injury\nIs not being against lawful entry I mean that's\nThe same thing birthright citizenship and yes that's what we were just talking about is when you have as I was just discussing in one of the cases that has been previously decided not\nNecessarily on where the United states stands on birthright citizenship but on this particular case when you had to Chinese Americans who were excluded from be naturalized because of the Chinese exclusion acts back in the late Eighteen hundreds and so as a result of that\nThey had a huge fight over their child whether their child's could be considered a ... they would have citizenship through birth\nBut typically that's not really how this is being decided that's not how it's being determined I mean I was reading a story just the other day of how the ... to a bunch of Russians are coming to Florida and they're having babies in Florida\nAnd then their children just with the hopes that their children can be American citizens and that's where of course you get the term anchor baby so I don't believe that to non citizens can give birth to a citizen and the and I just don't I ... and people can I respectfully disagree with people who who think otherwise\nUm but to that point\nThe\nIdea that you are somehow bigoted or against immigration because you believe in an organized unlawful entry is the height of vulgarity stupidity and dishonesty and when people have to\nRefrain and a dishonest fashion and maliciously I might add and try to re purpose their opponent position so asked to give them advantage that means they've lost\nThat means that their argument cannot hold water\nThat's what it means\nSo we're going we're going to get into we're going to get into some of this because I think whether or not the president can do it is that the big discussion can he do it is this something that he has the ability to do um there was um\nUh some there was there and there are also some discussion where people say that the draft or is of the fourteenth amendment that they did not the text of the amendment does not address the crux of this particular problem and that\nWhether this is revoked by executive order or legislative act\nI mean it it gets it gets into kind of a rock um some ironic territory in terms of living constitutional ism et cetera et cetera were going to talk about that with Jay Christian Adams as I said um additionally\nThe a\nI was reading another piece in the wall Street Journal from a judge on the Fifth Circuit court Jim ... who ... specifically wrote\nAbout birthright citizenship and also cited Dred Scott or the Dred Scott case would judge Roger Cheney which by the way and my first book I have an entire chapter that looks at the at the racist roots of gun control because interestingly one of the very one of the very uh measurements that Chaney used to deny Dred Scott\nA full citizenship as he should have been granted is that because of the racist or gun control laws of the day because\nShooter be consistently accurate performance\nIs also quality

the way he is that just it really taught the way the way that he uh allow it to the way he wink and nod to this group the way that I Know I'm not supposed to say it but I'm a national ask\nWow that's Julia Ioffe who where does she right again she is they'll give you the truth I Am going to withhold my remarks on that it's going to take everything I have\nI ashes rights are thinking of\nCome there

a ... okay you tell me if you think this is an apology listen we want to clarify\nSpoken that he does a lot of this has been a very emotional and personally painful time for I think I exaggerate and I apologize for that but what the point I was trying to have\nTo make is that it's not a coincidence that according to the ... the number of anti Semitic attacks has jumped by nearly ... percent and the first year that Donald Trump was in office and it's no coincidence because\nEven though the main danger is hunger All right way to let the learning that it has pointed out this in this race and has this article is just as resources away from monitoring them away from\nWhat's interesting is that the idea also surmise and and they they did a huge study and they looked at 'em threat given to journalists and pundits et cetera and and one of my ... one of my friend's son who is a talk show hosts as well\nUh they concluded that he was the number one singled out Jewish reporter\nAnd it happens to be a conservative so I kind of question whether or not truly understands what she's\nDiscussing there I don't know if that's necessarily an apology or if it's just her trying to excuse the fact that it would it mean for her to say that it was a U.S an exaggeration an exaggeration seems to be an underwhelming\nCharacterization of what she said you're saying that Trump has has radicalized more people than I said if you honestly even think that that's just a slight exaggeration you're too stupid to talk I'm Sorry but you are you are not\nYou are not clear headed or rational enough to engage in ... in this conversation because it because this is people who said this type of stop these types of things\nThey're not interested in any sort of solutions they're not interested in actually discussing anything and tried to resolve differences they just want to throw out rhetorical bomb like that and that's all this was and it was and to say that it was just an exaggeration or ham fisted I think it diminishes the offensive ... of the character of the comparison\nIt was stupid and we're all stupid or for having hurt it\nThat's what this was of course that's not the only thing she says I have to I have to hit this really quickly this was audio soundbite twenty four this was a later on with that same network listen\nUh that sets the tone and you know I have to say it's not just you know the freaks us have mentioned that share that pick up and they are Fifteen that they can buy as easily as they can buy a pack of cigarettes\nWell All right Eric chain uh as you ever had been suffering you combine our Fifteen easier then you can buy a pack of cigarettes as someone who clearly has never purchased either\nIt's the it's not an exaggeration and it's not ham fisted and as she is just one of those individuals who gets on television and so there's a bunch of red meat stuff and her side applaud wildly and this is what I'm Talking about in terms of ... you have people that said the basic of basis things\nAnd they think that this to some house substantive\nAnd it simply isn't I mean when you say things like that what does that do does it propelled the argument forward to elevate the argument at all does it does it grant anyone who was watching what is being discussed further insight into the issues on a deeper level does it do any of these things\nNo no all it does is it makes people clap like fields because the particular part is that they prefer I Know you're like all that they ... they just they they get some red meat that's all it is it's charming the water and a number pushback on a new book well this is also by the way the same network that says Fox is dividing us\nThat the network that you just heard all of this on as mad because they say Fox is dividing us\nIn fact CNN Business had a tweet earlier today it says quote the Pittsburgh suspect I got a talking point that dominated Fox News airwaves and discussing the caravan although remember ah the edge just as stupid as just the dumbest thing over they have been\nMinute to do on the radio show with me here today is a fabulous couple Bethany and Greg or ... or attack\nA Dallas who currently own thirty and communities right now have purchased forty six multifamily communities over the last three and a half years three thousand seven hundred twenty nine units and uh they've done thirty five different lead invest thirty three different ... of which twenty five of\nThem were first timers so the question came as we went to a break tell us your theory share with is your theory of having such a large percentage of your portfolio with first time investors I think it's an interesting concept\nWell the reason we did it when we first joined a lot of people are like you need to be heard they've done three great deal you need to go meet them and all these great deal\nAnd nobody really seem to be saying oh well yeah nobody knows somebody that is that in the early ... so it really I think that we only\nGet a better chance of getting on email\nOther thing that we have it at it that often that we don't have\nEvery system in place yet on the typically they already come up with your delicate on they already know how to set everything up while you can learn to think that if they you know you're sitting and watching them\nIf you're with at first time the you can eat any part of helping or the thing I really like a light on that you can find out exactly how they're getting what they look at with Iraq all all that stuff at ... west ... and ...\nAnd that's why we said that I could learn more\nInteresting point of view I'm going to share with you I think a first time investors are seem to have a little bit of an edge in my heart to some extent not honest with you\nOr for deals I bought into this year as a passive we're all super ... leads that I Know personally so um it it's going to sound disingenuous but here's the deal is that I Believe that for you guys a first time investor brings two things to the table that are better than a a a ...\nA a experience about your number one they're taking a lower percentage of override on the deal\nDue to the white paper the rules and regulations they can't go suck up a large portion of the profits on the front in middle end it back to the deal like\nA very highly compensated lead candidate for many years uh he's able to take up up to twenty percent of the deal whereas you know a ... percent\nStrictly most of these beginner deals are leads are buying deal small enough that they can afford to get into they qualify for it has it's not where they want to end up so they just attack\nYou know there is an attack mode to get this deal done number one because they're scared to death they are going to fail a so they're just all over it you know it's like peanut butter a slice of bread they're stuck to that deal and secondly they want to sell the deal because they want to move on they want to get to a big deal so they want to get to that result to that gain\nAs quickly as they care whether they're going to refinance the money out of salt really irrelevant but he gets you to that point sooner because they're just really more aggressive that people go like you know I already ... and and this was just another word getting into what brought you know\nThe story is and I go back to pumping iron which is about body builders Arnold Schwarzenegger is talking to Lou Ferrigno father Lou Ferrigno which is the hulk is trying to be our will do in the Olympia and\nLoose values are I don't know Louis pretty big he's pretty hungry you're you're ... you're not that hungry sitting in your you know blue is hungry lion and are looked at him because Louis may be hungry\nYou says but I always get fed\n[laughter]\nAs though there's something about being the guy at the top that's already done it that it has you know some thing to it so I have you guys realize the benefits from having lower compensations from the first time leads are not\nReally I Can't begin any like return for both first timers lead on and you know you're exactly right they had a lower percentage and also you know they were smaller scale it a lot easier to get\nYour money in an all out when you know you're only basing it on three hundred thousand that that meant that deal rather than I think we're in one ... like eight million dollars that's your money invested in that the al\n\n...\nWho's sold the the the ... were those beginners or with those all across the board the ones that you sold to ask in this practice is getting out of ...\n\nOf them were first time only two of them or one of the first time that it was actually a second sale at the second I only and then the other two were like eight eight at multiple deals\nSo six out of the were predominantly newer investors try to move their portfolio along\nWhich I should say and we've come to the end of the show now guys I Want you just do in your own words sure what the audience as a past skeptic\nHow you think they should overcome their skepticism and why you think they should overcome their skepticism as to this is an alternative investment plan compared to the stuff we've been taught our whole lives\n\nI Would think wondering I mean when you look at a Geiger sorry oh go go\nOn most of the millionaires when you look at it and they own real estate and they're there for it you know we are a lot of pieces a mutual fund the facts\nAnd whatever but to me that's not very tangible I mean we have gone in ... every single apartment community that we've invested it and there's nothing like looking at it I'm thinking of the things that we've done to improve those residents live\nIt really gets you a nice warm feeling and it's

them up from civilians in Georgia that on it we\nHaven't had a ban on assault weapons before the United states and I think we should do it again I think there has to be a conversation of how it's accomplished\nWe have to recognize that this is a national conversation but I didn't want to push back on it any notion that I Believe that the second amendment is not the law the land\nI support the second amendment we bought my father rifles every Christmas anti gun cabinet was a gift a couple of years ago [noise] it is possible to believe and responsible gun ownership and to believe that there should be regulations on that Anthony's Elliott said that\nAnd we have to believe as a nation than when our communities\nAs it did and and so she she bastard ISIS Scalia there which I'm going to get into a as well but this idea though she called an AR Fifteen a weapon of war which is pretty amazing to me because uh you know I mean there are millions of our fifteens out there and when she was asked\nWhether or not you know she wouldn't answer it\nShe would not answer it I Love by the way to people who mock those who believe that it is\nThey ... they mock those who believe that it is easy to go and round up millions of people who are here in the country illegally but it's totally feasible to actually go door to door to millions of household and confiscate millions and millions of firearms without it works\nThe idea that it is somehow\nA first off it's not even it's not even it's not even an assault rifle it's a civilian rifle\nAnd assault rifles and made up term anyway what people mean to say is that it's for military use for her to sit here and define it as a weapon of mass destruction is insane because keep in mind we just had a bomb than some other things defined as weapons of mass destruction of it is not\nA weapon of mass destruction these people don't understand ballistics they don't understand ah how would it even actually works it's not you're not even it's

going to ask him\nThis I I don't know why so I asked I actually I'm having a conversation when we were on break suppress Hilton who\nIs um well it just a gossip a blogger I think um but what gets me is if he tweeted now bear with me he tweeted quote this is just yes last night\nI don't agree with Donald Trump by many things but I Do think if a child is born in America to parents who are here illegally that they should not be granted automatic citizenship and I say this is a liberal and a Latino [noise]\nAnd I had asked him like why is this controversial\nBecause he's getting dragged over it\nAnd I'm not saying that he's you know we're best friends or anything like that but I I'm just like why is that controversial I mean he ... he and I obviously think differently about amnesty and a bunch of other issues but on that specific thing when you have parents who are not here legally and they have a child\nThe parents are not here legally they're or they're here illegally and they have a child why should that child be granted citizenship\nAnd I don't understand why that's controversial\nAnd he said well it's because they have Donald Trump's event sick but that's irrelevant it's a position to many Democrats support Harry Reid feel the same way I mean that that's what I don't why I think there are a lot of Democrats who don't\nReally believe that uh\nI think that there are a lot of Democrats who don't know who who don't who aren't on board with that\nBecause it doesn't honestly make sense it doesn't make any sense and\nI think the executive order something different entirely [noise]\nUm and I see a lot of people arguing about it but I I think that what needs to happen I the first is a a judicial review over the jurisdiction clause because there is literally nothing on record on that there is no review there is nothing examining that there has there is no precedent for because it hasn't happened\nAnd I think before that there I I think that we need and the reason I say this\nIs because I Am very very nervous just as I was with the previous administration I don't think that the ... I don't think that Trump in doing this to like I I don't know I'm not being naive I don't think that he's just I think he believes\nA that he's on doing something that was done with executive orders what I think honestly um but\nI don't think that he's doing it to be like a tyrant I think that he didn't he believes that he's doing something that was done unconstitutionally with an executive order or just based on the the how he addressed it and some of the statements that he said and things that he has discussed previously on it\nBut when it concerns doing anything we're amending anything with the constitution I get very nervous when I anytime I hear anybody any party talking of the executive branch of doing it with an e oh because\nI don't ever want it to become so commonplace that an executive order modify something in the constitution that something can be done regarding the second amendment over it\nOr even the first amendment or any or the fourth or any of them\nParticularly your natural right so that's where I get really really nervous it is not supposed to be easy to amend the constitution it that is not a bug of the system it is a feature of the system is supposed to be incredibly difficult\nIt was it was there are all of these safeguards put in place that basically say are you sure you want to do this you really like for real about doing this right now", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "31"}
