Shaw their reliance on him has not won them a World Series there's been met look when the ... six times ... times and they've been to one world series and Clinton cursed Shaw has not been awful in the playoffs\nHe's not been awful he has been like Peyton Manning and the playoffs where there's excellence in the regular season\nHe's he's kind of a\nNot a hit and miss pitcher but he'll give you a great game like he has before but also give you some sneakers and big situations in which he'll give up for runs in the seventh inning to the cardinals and\nThe Dodgers wind up losing that playoff series but says the cardinals aren't here that it should change right they need to be able to move away from him and focus on\nOther players and bettering the team\nFact this is at the point where you got to think if you're ... Shaw do you opt out at the end of this year 'cause you're in for two more years but he's got an opt out after this year\nAnd I don't know how this is going to play because certainly Kurdish was gonna say the right things it's the playoffs but how is he gonna feel dude I'm the best pitcher in baseball and you're not pitching me in game one they could both be arrested for game five\nThe way the series goes it comes down to a game five both ... and ... could pitch at home on three days rest um I'm Sorry on regular rest so there's that option out there they could also start you in game five if he can't doesn't pitch will ... could come in but now you are relegate encourage shorter game to status and\nNot only from the fact that they need to look to move on from him and I don't know if this is the first thing of the Dodgers saying hey we need to\nCreate an identity that is not reliant on ... because we've we've done it for six years now seven years now and it's not worked out for us in the playoffs regular season has been great and ... it's been great what it is relying on him in the playoffs has not worked out for us so here's our first step towards\nThe flip side of it is win or lose game one while you're coming back with Kurdish on game too\nYou know if he loses gave one it's oh man what are we well you got crochet on game too if Kurt show loses gave one it's oh man the mental hurdle that the Braves get over going oh my goodness we ... we're we're going downhill now in this series now we've got to be where you and that's it\nThis is a very big deal and it's about ... being bypassed\nAnd this is where the Dodgers should do not quite pushed Clinton curse shot out the door but kind of say hey you know it could be sunny are out there for you thirty three million dollars for Clinton Kirk Shaw was a guy who's had a lot of back injuries over the course of his career the Dodgers hold their breath when he goes out there to pitch\nThis is the first move of that and it's in the playoffs and I love this move now I like\nThe move for for review and having her shy as the game to just from the the straight\nYou got a guy who's been dominant in on all season long pitching well it coming into the playoffs ride the audience right the old ride the hot and we did it in football talking about Ryan it's Patrick in Chile turned into a pumpkin you had to run with him and they did until\nThey threw up all over him self in Chicago and now James Winston back again after they're buying week six likewise you you got a guy that has pitch lights out you get him the ball game one including her shots professional enough to know what the deal is here and\nTo the to the thirty three million dollar argument it's not like the Dodgers don't have money\nLike those brink trucks backed up at every\nAnd every time on it right and and reorganize the it it doesn't matter but at every exit a\nDodger Stadium is a Grinch trucks full of cash okay that it's not prohibiting them from spending money at any point to build around there's other teams where that's the case spending thirty three million dollars on one pitch or prohibits them from doing anything else we've seen that all across\nMay not painting for the Guggenheim states I mean that's that's one thing I Do that's about it and I looked at it after about a fifth of a pain in some of them make depending on\nWhat she got floating around I mean you know you go back to some of the the scream and things like that solid like join a million dollars but we'll get into that at the time but you you have an opportunity here and yet Walker ... as well\nLike clean current Shaw he sees where things are headed doesn't mean he's going to accept less money to stick around noticed I mean the Dodgers have to spend less money they've only built a team\nAnd while he's failed in the seventh inning of games in the bullpen didn't let him down more times\nThan the number of years you and I have been alive but the fact of the matter is you get Roberts is operating from a very luxurious position here they'll take some heat if it it blows up\nBut the metrics and the math and the they feel and momentum that you look for in baseball because they always talk about getting out to run and having your momentum rolling into the playoffs\n... everything points to this being the absolute right move for the Dodgers\nAnd and it it really is pretty simple it's a gutsy move for Roberts 'cause he lives in ... elite himself open the second guessing if it doesn't work out and I understand that part of it but\nReally for Roberts ago we've done it for the last six years I mean we need to do something different we've done it this way and look what happened it didn't work out for us we have the luxury now of a couple of really good pictures especially at home viewer now his confidence is sky high or this is the right move and I'm telling you what\nStart thinking about a Dodger future without Clayton ...

what's happening in Mike\nI feel so badly about missing yesterday but I kind of this sort of joy that story about the uh the running back\nAmerica getting his or his advertisement or like the way she said you use like a roller ... she said\nBut [laughter] without or is that\nGot like a beauty tea or was it a Butte pay I I just it was kind of like well\nThat's one of those things where we don't give you the real answer you have to pick the answering your head you know one of those movies that doesn't tell you how the ends you pick the ending you liked the most that's how it goes uh\nI'll pick the multi let's move on\nI well speaking of picking the ending I like the most out of the one I liked the least you got take us through this my two big things\nComing off the weekend in the NFL we're still trying to figure out the browse look like they have the game against the raiders salted away they have a first down run by Carlos Hyde it's ruled a first down on the field but the officials go back and look at it and they rule that his elbow came down before\nHe got to the the line for the first down the browns half the fun of course we know they go to overtime and the raiders when what did you make of how that whole turned out\nWell I'll tell you when I saw it happen I it was pretty disappointed because I just didn't see anything that would allow them to move the ball from where it was originally spot it\nAnd then you know literally slept prompted on Sunday night and then I looked at it on Monday morning and I looked at the lives you know if you look at that and that's what they based their decision I don't know if you look it up well you know maybe short and the\nSo I looked at further with the boy and the you know who commented after you know as what happened and so he couldn't believe that they fall\nAnd he's absolutely right um you know you look at it you got to get through the night there in the middle of a field with no deal marking no solid windy yellow line is accurate um and and we know that it's not used\nAnd if you look at it like that there's really no way you can move the ball um\nI get it they pieced together they saw that when my hand was down the elbow was down in the same time and you look at it especially in relation to what the Mac or a yellow one show that you could say could be short lemonade the yellow line and looked at the Nineteen the hash mark\nYou just couldn't change and um you know it's we're getting concerned because in the first two weeks of the season the\nRate of reversals was very low which meant they were staying with the calls on the field unless it was clear and obvious and in the last two weeks it's all the way back to what it was at the conclusion of last season which means\nThere may be starting to get a little technical and then going through a street and I feel bad for the brownies 'cause I was there when they won their game and ... ... um they really got the short end of the stick or the short end of the down marker I guess on on on this one\nAlso in that game we had the art and the play where he basically did an old school WWE clap alongside Baker may feel but did drive him to the ground\nGets called for a while the the roughing penalty or we only have five of those this week they'll bite so at least had a downturn in those calls but that one's lit up the Internet as we were confused once again as do or what exactly are we trying to accomplish here\nWell I mean they actually what they called was for how much contact with their helmet conquer I certainly didn't see it that way but Troy Vincent um did come out\nAnd say that he was okay with that call because there was helmet contact um we weren't um we just didn't you know in this day and age after this conference call that the competition committee hat with the ... as\nWe felt that was given to set a standard that was not going to have us where we were for the first three weeks of the season and I make it turns out to be true at least in the ... guards with Randy and on top of the quarterback with most or all of your body weight because there was only one of those call\nAnd I agreed with it because it was CJ better to San Francisco who got driven into the ground and the defender made\nNo attempt to races all or to break the fall which is now a new interpretation that is there no attempt to get to the side so I I was I I was encouraged by that but Walter Andrew Sunni Arabs ... lead in the in the number of\nRobbing the pastor's call then to me\nTo me oh Troy can defend that if you want to maybe there are slight contract but if that's rough I never even played quarterback and I wouldn't mind doing it now\n[laughter] I I feel pretty damn saved if I could take my glass of wine out there if I wanted to and joy\nAnd joy in my classroom and feel very protected while I'm throwing the ball so I just think that was that was too technical for the call\nThat certainly would make the ratings for the NFL games increase even more if you were out there that lasted why why it happens my you know the thing that gets me the most is that and this surprises me pleasantly is that\nBy this point I expected defensive players their heads the pop off getting call for these penalties but they you know even like clean Matthews he's upset in the moment Andy\nGathered himself and goes back and yes the defensive players are very upset but when these flags are thrown they they really just know when to just back back away and say okay we got to move on when by every right they should say I don't understand what I did wrong you have to help me out a little bit here\nYeah and I and I think two things happened when you get to let let's go back when you get to this initiating contact with the helmet which isn't the first two weeks was a disaster fifty one of them were called\nAnd then something laying got hurt and said hey if it was in a burden or unintentional it's not to be a foul and what happened the fifty one in the first two weeks a preseason only twenty and the second two weeks\nOnly been three I think that have been called in the entire first or weeks of the season so it leveled off because official adjusted and so the players and and I think that's where we're headed now with the ... the pastor thing you you watch and you can see and we showed a video\nWill come back you know here's some more conventional wisdom says you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version and bumps and\nWelcome back to the last segment delves radio show with me here today as Robert Martinez a what a bar most prolific investors here at lifestyles is taking it way beyond anything that was our personal attention with why still members to accomplish he's out there trying to create a massive\nBusiness that is number one in the industry two thousand seven hundred sixty two year to sixteen properties or two hundred and thirty five million dollars with the net value\nAnd a man unbelievable accomplishes robbers we'd go to break it got cut off I think you were trying to explain to people with different so you were explaining to people the difference between marketing and sales my life I started I was a salesperson health clubs\nAre so all we ever did was praying higher in train sales people\nIt's so you you said that you came out the seals background you were professionals sales person so you good at hiring a train those people on the ground to make the sale\nBut how does it come to you that somewhere along the line you have to have the marketing department\nResidents which we sales and marketing or else did I just that you know you you we fell apart you'll get your team train to ... to sell that product and ask questions at the justice tails and open ended and you know try to find out the features that benefit and cook that but\nMarketing is the act of driving people into your door\nYou know to me and marketing and many of my colleagues was\nDoing a great renovation on the outside using knife cutters but in the new eight feet and change it up from yes Peter or take into hearty board and making a clean because you're relying on the dry that marketing with a drive by mark you only get a only going to bring in a certain price point I've read that people are willing to pay\nSix hundred seven hundred eight hundred dollars a month and ... as you jumping rent\nYou got to that that was aren't the people that are going to be driving by you got to bring these people went and I think that classy property that but I didn't understand that I needed a better marketing team I Need to understand how to drive in people and so\nAnd also as it were any or being a properties right I mean we're all these extra tremendous right grow right probably more so than the income growth of our residents right so we might see some turnover we're still push it right so you used to be for you know seven hundred and ... it you're not offer nine hundred nine fifty well\nThat's not the same rhetoric class you're gonna have to bring in that that more\nThat that rhetoric has more discretionary income to be able to afford it so where do you find them you gotta use marketing and these marketing marketing team that I basically took over from one for ten thousand you report\nYou know to my twenty five hundred you know the type portfolio you know Toby I I don't have the right tools\nAnd they say you've got to develop a different a different set of tools that we had to ... to our website\nUm I consider is now up or fails and media company versus just they probably management company\nSells is very important but so is the media but promotion of your business as well as far west type now have acted video\nIt was very key we have videos of a resident of and videos of of our of our men and he's like a one probably got the property that you can come visit they have a great video on our website of a dog park why wall because I had that probably eighty percent one bit\nSixty percent of all of all singles in people that live in a one bet on our own a have a pet\nAnd so you got to be pet friendly so the very first thing we're trying to do is attract that were kept furniture that video of a dog park right but there's the analytics behind it like where do they come how do they find your website\nAnd again this is all new to me to his walks are hoping that maybe what a great are expanding it but you've got to put keywords in their cars are searching on the Web right there typing in key words and that key words will bring them back to your\nWebsite if you have a a word in their additional either do it a lot of like Facebook promotion or Facebook Live a a feed\nA Google likes that they like to promote things that are active not just bail and so this team commit to me and they explained to be all these different concepts are like wow and say look we will double triple your eat\nThe kind of leads are getting in a two or three month period I'm Sorry ... you know I'm Sorry that you're getting for all year we can do that in the two or three month period\nIt would be just trust the process and that that that's what we're doing I think the collapse they\nExplain to it but there's another level\nOf operation that we needed to get you as a result we'd be able to bring that down to where it being the portfolio the property that you visited I mean what did you see you saw a giant TV with videos running in the background or our Hurricane Harvey efforts where we helped out at church and bread creek or turtle our breath capture walk\nA video of art that ... that we did a fundraiser for me to celebrate our maintenance man another video or a Harvard different a baby and then you saw that virtual three D. for fire where they could put on the little Google Goggles and pretend like through there in in you know\nIn the actual model\nSo that in case they're not their their decision maker who or their significant other is a with them during the during the tour they could go home they could use as a cardboard box that we gave them that after the Google Goggles they put their phone and they're download the app and now they can or at home without having to be in your in your property these are things that were only a dream\nYou know where do you mean they were not even a dream I mean I don't even know we have the ...
