I mean they got they've gotten very technical thing you don't need as many wires and if this would be this and all\nKinds of stuff and I'm like that is a great training that you can just look because I look at it and I'm like it looks like a microphone\n[noise] so I you know I'm not a bomb making expert person but um [noise] a day in and one\nOf the things that Jones and said yesterday to as it doesn't matter how fancy it's done up and then you can still be some of the some of the most effective ones can still just to be a very rudimentary\nSo this is the latest this is what we're looking at a also this a little bit of that I have a couple of other 'cause I was looking at some of the X ray images that\nThey all had of it [noise] I have to say [noise] I was kinda flabbergasted yesterday when I saw the statement that was released by CNN president Jeff Zucker\nThat has to do with that was in response to the bombing [noise] [noise]\nI just um was really genuinely shocked by\nThe statement that he released and that CNN put out on their official PR channel\nReads as us quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding that the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's far they have shown no comprehension of that\nReally\nWhat what what what by the way this\nHe comes out and make this statement [noise] [noise] [noise]\nFor a news organization\nBefore any any other details are known while an investigation is ongoing and he immediately reports it's related specifically\nDo because of the president\nI've never seen it isn't that kind of the opposite of news to make grandiose associations with zero evidence to support set association\nOne candidates bananas you and\nI and the fact that he came out with that I thought this is exactly what we're talking about\nWhen people criticizing the media this is exactly why people say what they say when they discuss the media\n\nAnd I want to get into a little bit of that because there were some really rich ironies that took place yesterday and ended up taking place this morning as well\nJust I mean I I just can't um it's kind of amazing to me that's the opposite of news\nAnd I said on Fox and friends this morning look\nI didn't go out the day after James Hodgkinson shot up a ball field\n... screaming about health care trying to assassinate a Republican lawmakers and she was very nearly successful [noise] what could have easily have said look at this look at a Facebook page people\nLook at all the ... all the like city has look at the networks that he likes to look at you read the media matters he reads all these things he reads he watches cable news he does he's he worked for Bernie Sanders\nAnd in fact\nRecall\nAny one of influence on the right St anything remotely close to that\n\nWhich is why I Am just flabbergasted that Jeff Zucker\nCan say what she said in this statement wouldn't know anything to support his association\n\nI didn't go out and say all the rice and that was going to all these Republicans that well there you go Democrat\nI didn't go out and say to the destruction of all these Republican offices there you go Democrat I didn't go out and say oh my gosh look at all these assaults and everything else that are happening in the streets look at it cetera et cetera there you go Democrats look at the college campuses that we're burning look at the\nLook at the lawmakers that are being hunted down and and some assaulted some are being docked there you go Democrat\n\n\nSaturday blood there lecture and everyone about this with moving on down the line rage rooms rage rooms are the latest self care craze that won't make anybody feel any better apparently\nUm there's a thing called the wrecking club I don't know what this says it's a bunch of people who've never I'm engaged in any actual real life demolition and some of them look like they could benefit going to the gym instead of going to someplace where they\nSwing a sledgehammer they can barely control with their week our muscles and chew glass brick et cetera and they actually are charged to do this crap\nThey're called rage rooms [noise]\nNormally wouldn't that be just like a psychiatric mold facility oh well\nThere you have a Republican Josh Hawley leads Claire McCaskill by seven points in an internal poll in Missouri and coming up we're going to discuss how Claire McCaskill's latest ad actually made Democrats angry and that could actually even hurt hurt even more with voters will discuss that\nAh also thousands of Swedish people are inserting microchips under their skin which sounds insane because it is\nTechnology they say is getting closer to our bodies and that we're going towards singularity the chips are apparently designed to uh have these there they go into hands and it's supposed to ease up your daily routine so all you got to just wipe your hands against the digital reader\nOr you could just hold something as swipe is against the digital reader in your hand [noise] you know there's there's also that Alec Baldwin show is bombing according to the rats yeah I Know he had a show they were talking about having me come up and being on his first week but it didn't work out because I have a schedule and also it's our fault one

the words were used were\nBomb bomb bomb bomb bomb just to\nPoint for demo rating I'm barely edged out uh some show on Univision and it was I guess it's on the Sunday prime time Alec Baldwin show\nAs what it is I don't know okay there you go I have that you're furiously typing somewhere what'd you say maybe a ... yeah\nNo no no we're not going to do that I can I Do that at all\nOh lord of the rings trilogy is going to become a streaming service in November ah that that was actually just announced this morning which I think that's pretty cool Netflix is putting out some pretty cool stuff

rhetoric\nRemember we have a president was talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning who've political rival until the recording who is encouraged violence against the media or just last week talking about the assault on a reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that ... that you've kind of got\nTo see this outside of the context of the president's stability hostility towards a towards this was going to try to briefly speak towards unity towards rock Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down the the political rhetoric they are making people less safe they are making journalists less safe and they were making law enforcement officers less safe\nBut we don't know who do this or we don't know what their motive was right but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's ... but it's an obvious rode the Obamas according to John Brennan CNN\nUm George Soros these are people and organizations that President from countries really attacking demonize recalls\nBut if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed\n... grave you know I this is oh my goodness oh my goodness I
