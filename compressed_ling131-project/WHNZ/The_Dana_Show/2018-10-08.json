{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Back so here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time bombs and\nWe'll go back to do while do radio show today we're discussing six different reasons why real estate\nInvesting or the investment in real estate is more profitable than any other types of investments other than maybe owning your own business\nAll a Bill Gates or ... or anybody Warren Buffett who owns Berkshire Hathaway\nOr those types of businesses are already business for that matter run correctly is going to have the highest rate of return out there but real estate is one of those things is right there where the\nUh the next two we've done one through four so far first one was capital act or was captured act we second one was cash flow third one was appreciation for one was forced appreciation and number five is capital gains\nUm when you look at a piece of real estate you have something called capital gains it is not cash flow and it's not ordinary income\nAnd when you pull this money out it gets taxed at a lower tax rate\nOr it doesn't get taxed at all now we can take and force appreciation or forced a capital gain through real estate where you buy stock there's nothing you can do to force a capital gain weight can force that capital gain\nBy improving the quality of the property or just improving the management of the property\nNow when this capital gains curves what's different for us is that we don't have to sell the property to capture the capital gain we can refinance the money out and the money that comes out is tax free so I'll give you an example we buy property\nFor a million dollars we put two hundred thousand dollars down we get eight hundred thousand dollar loan and we go in there and we increased the income by just ten percent so the income was three hundred thousand a year a minus two hundred and expenses which gave us a hundred thousand dollars and not operating an income\nThat net operating in comes the amount of money we learn if we own the property free and clear and that after all expenses so we make a hundred grand a year now we take that up I temper said two hundred and thirty thousand by increasing the sales from three hundred to three thirty\nDrop to the bottom line three hundred thirty thousand dollar a hundred and thirty thousand dollars income now makes the property worth one point three million dollars\nWe now go back to the ... like a new eighty percent loan and they give us a loan for a one million fifty which is eighty percent of that\nOne point three and then we pay all the old line of eight hundred thousand dollars what do we walk away with his two hundred and fifty thousand dollars tax free that remember we had to pay fifty thousand closing costs to do the first trans actually with ... fifty thousand do the second treads actor actually a little less than that but it all with all would basically comes out to about a hundred percent\nGain how does it take to make that game well in some cases\n... property small enough we can get that all the stuff done that needs to be done to turn that around within six months larger property might take a year\nReally large property might take two years the longest one I ever did was Eighteen months and in Eighteen months uh we made the property go up else should we bought it at a thousand or door we put forward and if we owned it for twelve we sold it for thirty five\nSo uh from\nFifteen to thirty five twenty thousand dollars a door\nUm aggregate\nThat's a lot of money especially since it was like three hundred and Twenty years or something like that so it was a it was a mass again and again just round those numbers off you don't have to have specific actual numbers to conceive what I'm Talking about but the very simple fact is now in this case we did selves property but before we saw that we did a refinance and we pulled out\nThat equity tax free\nNow what's going through the last one here because we only got a few seconds left here a few minutes ... minutes ... seconds and that's tax benefits what you can do with real estate is you can prolong paying taxes for the rest of your life you can differ differ differ and then get out of paying taxes by dying\nSo let's talk about all this time of differing all the taxes on the casual by using depreciation to cover it if you don't understand this go back to what am I the ... gas or come to the seminar would teach at a used ... to pay no taxes on your casual\nYou could do that for the rest of your life you could do a ten thirty one exchange and sell the property by another one without incurring any capital gains huge role in whatever tax a liability have into next property\nAnd you could do that property up the property after property to you die\nNow when you die\nYour family is going to inherit that real estate in stepped up bases meaning all ... all the difference between what you pay for it and what it's worth it would be a capital game that all gone all the pay down mortgage\nAnd all the depreciation taken to allow you to earn those Castro's free they all disappear completely disappear noticed so you look for when your family for\nThem to get to that money they would have to pay the taxes on the four one K. to get it out\nBut your family could inherit this real estate virtually tax rate up by we're we're not talking about inherited stacks we're talking about paying income taxes are the income that had been hurt by you that you never pay taxes on you've never pay taxes on the casual you never pay taxes on the capital gains and you're giving it to them and they're not going to pay it either\nNow on your stocks if you had it before when Jay and the stocks go up ... or even if they're not for what can you give them stocks the difference between the basis of what you bought them for what they're worth\nIs going to be taxable ... four one K. the dividends would not have been tax yet they would also be ... if you had not had a instead of for one kid in each year when you got the evidence you'd have to pay taxes on them she was talking about earning\nSix different ways will say five different ways and not paying taxes are\nWe talking about race to return that you could say total up to a thousand percent return you could say average a hundred percent return if you put them altogether divided by the number of years you owned a real estate\nIs easily easily\nFour or five ten times better than any other investment out there that my friends to discussion ahead with this lady as we sat there and ate dinner and enjoyed liked worrying about where to put\nA couple of million dollars that you don't know what to do what a problem to have to remember always though this isn't about the money it's about the lifestyle have a wonderful day we'll see tomorrow\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]

health today we're going to talk a little bit about immune health\nAnd this is really a a big deal and um most people are not aware of some of the armamentarium that's available these days ah one of the big players on the block that has not been available before\nIs something called nuclear tides and these are the actual building blocks of the cell and it takes a staggering six billion be\nTo build one cell so once we had to blow an injury traumas surgery or even a cold or flu or anything that would damage the tissue we're calling upon our supply of nuclear times well\nOr if you've got some great if you don't you just have to wait\nFor the body to make enough and when this comes to\nA building new tissue it can really be a problem\nThat say you had his surgery and nobody's gonna pack whatever it's gotten on hand into that ... or ... or injury but if you've got those nuclear ties will uh this can mean helping the body deliver or promote the best possible recovery and function for your body [noise]\nYou know and nuclear ... have been around quite a while in Europe is sold under the name on set because they view them is so important to promote best health if you're struggling with any kind of immune issue\nAnd of course in addition to nuclear tides ... is another key player that can act like a stand in immune system especially in your intestines because it as human active pre formed immuno ...\nAnd of course this is completely different than a nuclear tides and what is able to do and of course the needs of the time is for nuclear diets are can easily be satisfied there but\nUh you can reduce this white cell demand\nDuring all of this by jumping on a little bit of ... really great thing to do\nBut you know one of the big missing links we don't usually have normal levels of vitamin D three and in the last five six years\nDe three has been shown to be a critical player in the formation of literally all two hundred plus immune compounds at the body mix wow so this is really key player so we produce a product called de three gold and\nUh it's really good to use about probably about six drops of this and if you're under forty you can just take the drops straight preferably at your main meals so there's plenty of protein\nAnd that's the escort for the fat of the deeds three\nAnd if you're forty or over then you really should consider putting the D. three and a half ounces of water and adding a three four drops of an organic lemon ... that's essential oil of orange stirred up good you'll see that the lemon is the most effect\nAnd quickly the droplets the D. three become tiny tiny so now regardless of how your ... performing\nYour body's going to absorb this beats read just beautifully\nSo these are to me the ABCs that everybody ought to

health plan live or we're going to go to the phones now let's go to Rick\nIn San jose California and he's got some bad dandruff reddish on his chest in armpits and the doctor said she used to build up they're probably right are you there Rick\nHow old a man or even how much do you weigh\nI'm sixty nine weigh two hundred pounds\nWell the first thing you want to know is it dangerous is everybody has banned but when there's excess sugar going to the scale it intensifies the production of something called ... saved them is like a glue\nAnd it starts sticking the dandruff that everybody has together so it becomes visible but otherwise I'm having to Andrew but you can't see it\nIt's microscopic in size okay\nSo so the first thing they have to do is tell you you're getting way too much sugar cane and so this of course is the result of not getting enough starch when we crave sugar we may have depleted or the vitamins so we can't metabolize starch\nAnd or we don't have storage so they're very simple thing is for you to get a copy of the biofuel diet\nAnd the resource list\nAnd shift gears and lay off meat fish poultry eggs and dairy products\nFor a Ninety Days and after the Ninety Days then you'll have occasionally the foods that are listed there but the ones that said you can have occasionally you don't eat for the first Ninety Days now what this is going to do for you at your age\nIt's going to give you thirty more good years buddy\nIf you're smart if you're a dumbbell you won't follow this it'll kill you in the American food will kill you so I'm hoping you're smart and I can tell you the the east build up is also failure of your digestion\nBut that's classic thing that's happening in America I'll show you how to fix that in a minute and then I get some vitamins like max stress be and I take maybe a couple of teaspoons a day to promote your best starch metabolism and help ... any sugar craving\nOkay now the next thing we got to do for you desperately is that you're not eat another cooked food meal without taking digestive enzymes like quantum Dodgers\nAnd you need at least two of these at the start of the meal the end of the meal you want about six between ...\nAnd now you're digesting more like you did in your twenties you'll be lighter you'll be stronger you'll need less sleep you'll see your ideal weight just comes on like a Banshee and you're going to feel more like you felt at forty nine instead of sixty nine\nNow sometimes the HDL will burn if it does you drink a bunch of water to go away but that's a warning we've got a scar on the center line of the body\nUntil you can get to a cue or a practitioner and get a mud back you'll get something called the stomach support and you'll have to take three capsules that your body size empty cup fill the cup of water do high boil stored up steep it ten minutes break it before you eat now the HDL will totally agree with you\nAnd now you're digesting well so this east problem is is history and you know what changed the way you're eating show the craving goes away and of course the ... is a minor side effect that will be gone okay good All right but I just give us for the Orlando I'll help you\nYeah I understand but mom you're in charge\nAnd you can get all the food they want as long as it's food that is not does not contain refined oil or meat fish poultry eggs or dairy products okay and so if you get a copy of the biofuel diet you can see substitute foods that\nTastes really great that they'll love that don't have any of that crap oil added to it and watch this and just watch what happens it's just like miracle okay\nIt used to me that my mother never return it back and not getting any effects out if there was no\nYeah you know why don't you go to the food is so much better back then and now the food now is loaded with persistent organic pollutants that get a great name they call it pops\nRight yeah and so if you're not on the same playing field okay\nI was hearing anything with me 'cause she just got out in the\n... it could but you have to remember that her immune system okay I guess we should just take a minute and explain to you what the problem is\nShe the real problem is that the food she's eating her immune system is trying to stop from entry into the body it sees it as alien food and it sees it as a toxin\nAnd as a result the body is fighting like heck now any other little thing that comes along can nail her that's the problem so whatever else is around she's going to get\nUntil you give her food that can make a strong\nOkay take
