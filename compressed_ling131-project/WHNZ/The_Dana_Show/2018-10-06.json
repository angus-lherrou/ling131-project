account than he is a football\nNo talent on that roster at All right now so\nJust to put it on him I Can't clearly the front office was a train wreck man they're trying to rebuild and it looks like they've at least got some people that have an idea of how to draft to build the team so maybe in two to three years' time if he can stand up right\nThey'll have a team around him to where you can see some results but in the interim you've got a lot of empty stats right it's it's the empty shoot\nWe had an Oakland with Reggie McKenzie and well people may get mad at John ... what he has to say the only thing I'm mad about is that he basically addressed the guy that you still in the job I mean you've done a terrible job and I'm stuck doing things because if you\nOkay so you got an empty suit prospect the the tie Lou idea in Cleveland when LeBron James with their just keep trickle down effect here you got Andrew Luck with the a shell of a team\nAnd if he makes it through sixteen games\nAll applaud him for that [noise] you know it is an interesting phenomenon how people want to jump in and people will check marks who want to jump in\nFor an opinion of either Andrew Luck is overrated or the Dodgers are pushing Clinton ... out and they act like you've offended them personally well that's the larger I mean that's the greatest I graduate that's what I Want to do with check box that are saying this I Can't believe that one guy said well what did I was I\nI was running rampant across across America like I was suddenly I was ruining out but if\nYou were like holding a maid if you're running if you're really America because you've got a hot got Andrew Luck and God Bless that I'm going back into the ... table and and we're going to have a lot of fun [laughter]\nGod it becomes this personal attack oh it's nobody's going after you and your love of Andrew Luck you got to do that yet the poster on the wall or on your ... and uh so that's where we're at right\nNow Clinton cursed shot up to nothing Dodgers batting in the bottom of the second inning Boston Philip five to over the Yankees in the seven but earlier today he used to be the Indian seven to they take game one they had a lot of home runs and the big takeaway from this game\nIs I really was surprised that\nA team and a manager\nLike Franco who likes to doesn't mind taking guys out early you know he's the guy that really a couple of years ago jumped in with the hey I'll take my starting pitcher and put my clothes run in the city the only\nWay you would hope and with four different guys and shuffled him as nets\nYeah you're like what's going on why or why why is Andrew Miller coming in and the fifth inning because Terri Frank Kona wants to bring him in that early he will go to his guy I Know we've got a thing for Cory clover and Corey clippers of a phenomenal pitcher\nBut you could tell today he didn't have it right he hit a couple of guys which he doesn't hit guys and he gave up a home run a couple of heart base heads and I'm thinking okay that's it he's he's he's got to go get them because\nIn the playoff games get away from you very quickly but he's stuck with them let them give us back to back home runs and the game was over I mean now you're chasing for runs and suddenly it's boy that happened really really fast\nAnd by the time you call back and get a couple of runs well it it's still it's four to five to six and then you're done but that's a that's a situation where\nIf he has a better hook on Kleber and a better read on him for the day that maybe this game goes a little bit differently in the Indians tight and who knows what happens from there but really after that I mean after was\nBang home run in a bag of big hitting another big it and the and the quote exit velocity off of these off of these pictures and I'm going okay this is not clippers that you could just tell it wasn't as day and\nHe left them in and that that's a regular season move and that's something that really surprised me that he let that he left them in that long and then the game got out of hand\nStill your age thinking that he can go into the bag of tricks that even if he doesn't have as best stuff\nOr that you can buy another inning of work right only gave up to up to brag men all around in the fourth thinking you come back out in the fifth maybe you shake it off if you're only down to nothing goes back to what we talked about what the the other day right if you if you only gave up two runs in the in through five you were feeling okay with your ball heading\nSession likewise here thinking you get to the fifth and you're good\nWhile he gives up another home run and all of a sudden it's or nothing but you're still within a slam much like we've been talking about here with the red Sox and Yankee game a as a on a fly ball people are now of wading birds\nAh in in their way to have a mad mad mad world we're living in here Smith but I think that's it you're just trusting that even within eighty percent or whatever percentage you want to throw on his\nVelocity is what is breaking malls doing everything that you're going to be able to get through unfortunately in in this part you're also facing ... who was lights out and there was no chance to get back into the game\nTwitter at how about a fresco Mike at swollen dome that Jason Smith show with my best friend my carbon in yes Dodgers threatening again never run or a second with one out in the bottom of the second in the already lead the Braves two to nothing so we got more baseball Camp David on what's going on in both of these games\nBut straight ahead Tim T.
