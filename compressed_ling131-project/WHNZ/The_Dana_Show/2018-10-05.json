church and state none of us favor a a theocracy so that's not what we're talking about but the\nBut the expulsion of faith from the public square there was never the intent of the framers of the constitution as a matter of fact many states did promote various religions again not for me a theocratic a dictatorial point of view\nBut just from a public policy point of view and so we reached a point as a result of a case called ... and ... under an FDR Supreme Court\nWhere you had a gentleman by the name of Hugo Black and Hugo Black or was the first nominee or if you are made to the Supreme Court and he was in Alabama and he was an old time Alabama segregationist\nAnd he uh he was the lawyer for the Clinton for two years as I've explained before\nAnd he got involved in that decision the ricin which started the uh the the process for unraveling American history in the public square in terms of faith and so forth and\nUh it's very interesting because uh even though he was on the right side of a particular decision he influenced the decision in the universe in case to the point she was anti Catholic and the school buses were picking up a little Catholic kids on the way and the the

snow\nAnd we just passed a spot in the batting order now if you don't have it you are coming out of the game Severino didn't give up a hit last night the first three innings he came out after four because he has thrown eighty seven pitches he didn't give up around it didn't matter he was done\nEvery game is a bullpen game if you're starting pitcher gets through four innings and doesn't give up a run every single major league baseball manager would say I'm gonna sign up for that right now for ratings yeah I'll go to my open after that\nEvery game is a bullpen game doesn't matter if they're if the game is started by a starting pitcher not every single game as the bullpen game you have enough farms that are going to be able to pitch with off days built in everything is fine and to say that all bullpen doesn't work is this is that no that's just the reality of the situation the major league baseball playoff\nPitchers get the hook early so you're into the bullpen earlier you get through five innings you're doing back flips starting pitcher that goes eight innings well then you are the luckiest team in the world but really you're looking at three or four innings and then the anything after that almost is gravy for a team well especially when\nYou're you're going back to last night in particular when you're looking at the age you're there on house money\nOkay you're you're they're trying to cobble things together and you look at it on the other side of what the Yankees are throwing at you in that light up and you're trying to find some creative way to get through especially when you don't have a nice when you look at the brewers and coming into this game at a very hard fought final couple of weeks to get where they are\nYou know what what are you got you got just seen and and beyond that\nOnce you guys so why not go to the bullpen theory as well\nAnd we we see it in in this game right now ... now that wasn't good at all what ... like it's done right you're not trying to find your way saying well he's he's been solid for the rest of the scene although I don't know how many times you can go to the note card\nBecause a lot yeah it'd be like if you asked the now where you don't get to have my own already underway to stand up the managers got some notes OR Books in their last year some signs just don't understand that the pitcher being able to just keep going to the bell fan\nOh wait wait it's a one on this guy now ... what does this change\nI'm passing out the facts everybody put your books away I went to see anything on your downright great up but the bullpen game not withstanding I mean 'cause we understand that's how it goes there's a lot of second guessing about black because of how the game ended and the game ended like this don't do\nIt [laughter]\n\n\n... who's not Mr baseball on that call Bob euchre a brewers radio network Mike with stock is and I wasn't ... I was saying ... or say boo earned earned a\nI Know but black as good a good question because\nYou had first and third with two out most stock is up\nAnd you have the right he left the match up and then you know listening to the game\nDriving in you know the the announcers on ESPN made a very big deal about hey you know you could walk him here you could not you know you could have strategy to walk and you could not and then after ... gets the game winning hit there is all about blacks going to be second guessed you know\nThere are second guessing that's legitimate and then they're second guessing just a second guess and that's what this would be just a second guess because\nYou had runners at first and third if you walk with stock is to load the bases you have you have nowhere to go where the batter and\nIf you wind up running up a high count I there there's merits either way to do it you can't just all this was completely off all by abide by black\nThe main thing that happened is that\n... who's a really good reliever\nThrough an old too fast ball right over the middle of the plate and it doesn't matter what you do you throw in oh two fastball over the middle of the plate it's going to get hit and that's why the Rockies loss it's not because they didn't walk was to either do it oh two fastball ... waste pits no nothing and oh by the way\nTo get out the pitch before the strike three was dropped I start you know being a drop strike for you got to be able to hold on to that so you can look at all of those things\nThere was no execution at the hold on to strike three don't throw fastball in the middle the plate you know out of you know that's not what you do is trying to locate it high didn't get it up high enough is that it was dealt tied right over the plate and restock smacked it for a base it\nThat's going to happen no matter what kind of strategy you put out there if a pitcher throws a pitch like that he's going to give up it\nHangs up and and gives up the hit to finish it up in it all goes back to the battery may we watched a little of that last night tried to frame pitches and\nGuys getting confused and crushed up behind the plate and not being able to sell it same thing here didn't didn't have the right communication and ended up not being able to finish the job one oh a in this format you to one Seventy five percent of the team that wins game

Mike its role with them that Jason show with my car but now let's meet a couple of Yankee fan shall we the first one we're going to be is a guy who was got all kinds of viral attention because of what we've seen over the course of today\nA Yankee fan put on social media video of one of the players from the Yankee game where the Yankees scored runs I I Can't tell what play it was but Yankee fans are celebrating so it's some kind of a player they score to run last night could have been in your voice triple it could've been the voice triple it could have been judges I could have been anything\nAnd it says in the left field bleachers where you see the video and I pointed out at how about a fresco\nThere is a Yankee fan with a beer in his hand and they're celebrating the play and he just decides to throw away food beer at the A's fan who is in the road below him and to fans oh he just throws the beer out um just because he's an A's fan\nAnd he felt like doing that disposable income right there about a number one that's a waste of Fifteen bucks number two I I ...\nFor every time I Want to defend the fan base on things things like this happened and this is not just a Yankee thing this mainly when I saw this happen you know and I see the fan and you know what God Bless the A's fan because he turned around obviously knew he was\nOut man out guns out numbered out\nPlanned he was out everything he turned around looked very upset but didn't retaliate probably 'cause he didn't know who did it\nThe AIDS found this guy and they gave him all kinds of they said hey can you help us find this fan from last night and we really want to help them hook 'em up we feel awful with what happened to him in the in the stands last night and they found them through social media people look so oh yeah\nThat's so and so and the guy lives in New York He's an A's fan you more as a span to the gate where he's Jersey to the game and so the A's or hooking up with tickets in a bunch of swag\nThey go to New York resident named John Spencer around him dried out John Spencer no not the west wing jumped out of Africa now drive the Oakland native and current New York resident will be sending Johnny care packages hosted met again next to you\nKnow that's awesome and look like I said there is many things you can say about the Yankee fans and this is a lot of Yankee fans unfortunately\n[laughter] much so it'd be good at that age that I mean that's Yankees there but\nThere's others fan bases that have the same thing happened to them it's not just unique to the Yankees it's just everybody that's out here tonight but I Will say this this is the most important thing I learned about where to sit in the baseball game or a football game if you are rooting for the other team do not sit in the bleachers\nIt is not as patrolled as the other areas things get crazy people are together it's the it's the cheap seats where people get in and want to get in and drink and and and cause problems do not sit in the bleachers if you are wearing the Jersey of the opposite is\nDark but that's actually the opposite I don't I just I don't think they were at just ... in the enemy you didn't get punched out\nFive guys didn't jump on Mr beating him it was literally do you oh you don't have us go to the point is is that when there is probably not a lot of A's fans right there's not critical mass no in terms of having extra security so there is something to what you're saying\nI was in the bleachers Red Sox Yankees were wanting security guards in my section ready for whatever the hell was going to happen so you you have different events where where it's going to be patrolled and staffed differently in Chicago certainly there's plenty of security in the bleachers look\nIt's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mine last night in front of the teeny\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com dot com\nWelcome back you know here's some more money and miserable wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person and then he\nMoved back to do well on the radio show with me here today is Kevin ... latest and greatest or multifamily mentor national multifamily mentor to get\nA Kevin has been with this for quite a while he's got a three thousand plus unit sixteen different apartment complex was he has ownership in and he's also older manager to apartment complexes water which us on a road trip were up there and it was beautiful\nUm you know it was very critical stuff whenever I go to these road trips I'm always looking to see that people are living up to the lifestyle standards your property was beautiful it was in great shape and we're very proud to demonstrate for everybody so Kevin as you become a mentor now\nWhat's going through your mind what what do you\nWant to bring to the table for people out there as as you've been bent toward for so many years how do you see it in water you want to bring to the table\nUm I've been thinking about that a lot too and and you know I uh\nI've always enjoyed helping people out trying to trying to figure out you know I did a lot of that corporate America to this is different this was a life changing kind of thing right I mean you're talking about\nIn some cases people's life savings in their investments and and and what they believe to be a great job security with a W too but um I I've been and I've seen a lot you know Eighteen years in high tech and I I think you know there's there's that group of people and certainly\nA lot of people who believe that well you know they don't have enough money to to make this kind of investment to do this kind of thing that we're talking about within myself with adults and real estate and I mean we do that absolutely not be true uh takes money to make money but it's doable but I think the website is true too I I Know for\nA fact that those people with NBA and PHD and they've gone to school you know many many years longer than I ever have 'em that have really high paying jobs that that believe the exact same thing that they are just they they're living way too good of a lot ever to make this kind of a jump\nBy all their time back and make more money than they're making now you know and so ... if I could reach out to people in and help people who are you know in situations like that that may be how comfortable W to that at that lifestyle that it's just good\nAnd and the problem is they probably think it's great you know they they're spending all their time with with having just they good lifestyle when they could get all that time back and really have you know a great lifestyle but if I could share that road map same road map that you shared with me and to give all that back to\nUh to our members to help them get through that and it's it's you know all of them versus you know\nPeople who may just want to invest passively others who want to do you know you know lead deals like like we're doing but I think we both thought we've seen people were placed there W. twos you know doing both of those so it's certainly possible but if I could reach out how people make that happen to answer those questions because that's the job\nYou know making a joke from a from a W two over two I'm gonna I'm going to lead on the ... than ... also and I know that's going to work I Know that that's going to pay off you know I'm at and I know that because we do it we we we've been doing it for a long time now um\nAnd but if I can help people you know get through that mental process that thought process and it helped create a plan for those individuals to make that same change ... them and their families that would be huge\nWell this is your entrance interview into the Brotherhood tours\nAnd I'm going to do this for the whole nation to here so that ah somebody can understand what it's really all about there's really three different ways to be a mentor that don't work one of them is to be to do guy you'll never ever ever\nMake a mistake if you tell tell everybody no to everything they try to do the easiest thing to do and just go ahead that's not that doesn't fit the picture those numbers are not good enough it won't work and uh I've had mentors that were the dough guy you know there's pooh poohed everything anybody tried to do then there's the yes guy\nYou know the guy that doesn't have the guts to say though I've had mentors that just couldn't look you die go Kevin that is the dumbest thing I've ever seen that he is not good at work you can't do that so they just say yes to everything\nThey don't have the guts to stand up to a person go you're going to ruin your life with that decision\nAnd then the third kind of useless mentor is the data blogger who could sit there and recites data for you to your ... but the data doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to put it to use and you know just because you do something\nIsn't that important number one saying I live buys a mentor no one cares how much you know until they know how much you care\nSo as we get out there and we want to gauge ourselves as mentors Kevin here is the gauge that I live by for all of my mentors for twenty seven years Kevin start writing it down how many people have you touch who retired while\nPut that on your resume take that would do the bag I retired ten Fifteen twenty thirty fifty hundred two hundred five hundred people who knows how many retired and twenty seven years put that on your resume and number two\nHow many awards have your mid to read one\nHow many times have you bought your mentor to the pinnacle of success where they one local state or national awards had to wear their pride in their business in what they're doing is so high\nThat they've you've built the next Kevin joggers\nThat you've built the decks winning mentor for us who are lifestyles if you do that Kevin you'll be as successful as a mentor to have been as an investor and we look forward you being with us I appreciate you coming on the show today I appreciate you being a member and I really appreciate you being a mentor thank you very much\nWell thank you do the rest of you out there remembered this\nIs not the money yeah we have money\nMost most of your life will have more money than we actually really needed to survive because we continue to grow it\nThat's not really the challenge the challenges can you go out there and provide for yourself and your family a lifestyle\nQuality lifestyle not just the average lifestyle but equality lifestyle and when you think about that think about this what gets the raven incredible lifestyle is good when you're sitting there right now listening you've already got a good life so Kevin had a good lifestyle\nMay be\nA very good lifestyle\nBut his good good enough what gets a new way of good is okay how many about they were sitting there with it OK lifestyle\nStarting

V. going on because with a cap some actually added a cream flavor to it because some people get stomach burning with um cayenne pepper\nRight into the small um ingredient of the cream flavor which comes from a milk product right we can't lay the label it vacant but there's so little in there even if you're lactose intolerant it's not going to affect you but that's why that's vegetarian so rest are speaking\nSo the ... does does it really a ... to what extent do you think it would help with weight loss or of being part of a person's weight loss program\nWhat's going to help with everyone genesis the heating up and the burning of calories and the breakdown of fat both the caps max and the coffee very the registered trademark ingredients have got substantial studies on that you know you talked about having some steady information in some real base clinically studied results\nAnd so we're using and they said we have DNA verified botanical in them and that's important too because when you extract the chemicals you can lose the actual benefit of the\nDay or something and so if somebody wanted to lose weight or they want to go on a weight loss program and they're looking for a protein product this would be this unto itself may not get them to lose all the way they want right\nCorrect but it would be supportive component of that program mhm\nAnd protein creates a sense of society are full feeling full so that helps with with calorie a management you know uh so that's helpful so if somebody were using this as part of a weight loss program the plant protein ... plus lean ... percent plan", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "05"}
