E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nAlright Claudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nNational event how are you okay thank you I'm a ... a lot of a lot of the topics and twice that\nYou make our our ... ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe\nFortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh that what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um [noise] it just what they're seeing\nTaking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them you know that they're they're ... they're um uh people coming from the Syria should ban and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd do we have the needed that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the you which is people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nAnd I find very interesting a fight and I like I can share it on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um [noise]\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement or reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and in others but also of course ... but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks to humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nWell then those people need to be addressed and dealt with\nAnd of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good to the community or not\nAnd this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society and to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual\nIs willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed as in view it that way conformity in uniform me there's not the priority as much liberty for an individual that as possible and in order to society and moral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that an economic system that is competitive that his market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and a well that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal on the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party leadership in a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and the people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that\nWhat's happening here on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ... of haggling marks and NGOs and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the road they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the light meant\nThe embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you All right Claudio thank you for your call appreciate it\n\nWhen they tell you this every night right up to election day first of all we are going to have an election day that is an election night program when this result start coming in moving from east to west I Will be here from six to nine pm all over the country so I think you want to stay with\nUs secondly you're the precinct worker in your home you need to make sure five to ten people come out and vote family members friends colleagues neighbors your in charge of the fate of this nation don't forget it [noise] we salute all of you ladies and gentlemen we appreciate you\nA former President Obama or Clinton Secretary Clinton and other public figures these terrorizing acts are despicable and anyone responsible\nWill be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law the United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards and then there was\nAlso let's pull this up as well\nUh there was a statement also from Mitch McConnell\nHe issued one\nAnd a little earlier saying quote a I stand with all Americans and condemning today's attempted acts of domestic terrorism and as we continue to learn more Americans are United in gratitude for the first responders the secret service the postal service and other law enforcement who protect our leaders in public figures from such unconscionable acts in ...\nSo this is the latest as we\nAre kind of watching to see exactly what\n... is there anything else what else is there good grief [noise] um but I think you I think it's safe to if it I think that was all organized um and to me that makes it terrorism\nThat makes it terrorism and apparently a so it would be the New York is saying that the Soros Clinton was Soros Clinton a Cuomo and I think the CNN one was they that\nThey are all linked I Would imagine all of 'em are like not just those I think those are just on the ones that they were able to confirm and apparently um wait there's more there was a letter I don't know if all of them received it but there was a letter containing a white\nSubstance a potential ... explicit so apparently there was a letter I mean all of this is coming in as we're so we're juggling it as it as it's coming and uh and that no no nothing was addressed to the White House a ... in New York uh\nNYPD has sent officers to a media outlets across the city yeah the packages lifted Wasserman Schultz is a return address which I think it's weird um and that's according to CBS local in New York they said that the ones that were apparently sent to\nClinton Obama their uh their sorting centers because they smartly and I would imagine you know you kind of have to you have to have a facility that goes through Medicare habits into your\nHouse your former president ah that does does packages had Wasserman Schultz is the return address it's important because it shows a disorganized and then it's one individual or a one entity so\nThis is what we know the U.S now that's far um and this\nIs I'm a CNN their their headquarters were evacuated\nUm and a parent I mean anchors were pulled off air alarms going off in the building and so it's ... there's and so there is a lot for Secret Service an FBI to figure out a lot for them to figure out um\nAudio or do we play twenty three hundred and twenty three that's yeah that's what they said that they they secured the device they take them to uh from what I understand they take them to\nA different facility correct to where they detonate them that's what I was like a robot that it's no no no they remove them from the ... and they take them somewhere and then I think they have a robot come in and detonate them or do whatever I like\nTo be as ... TV shows are moments reference for that but I have that moment on CNN where the alarm went off live on the air if you wanted to hear how that went\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I mean 'cause I think it's kind of interesting source\nOf the joint terrorism task force is taking the lead on this investigation\nWas movies are no longer suspicious packages to vi are saying that they were rudimentary but functional that means they were explosive devices or to a project\n[noise]\nScooter that's over ... lawyer will keep you posted on that but to a projectile ... that is a a future you'll often\nSee bombs the terrorists you know those were ISIS is usually early forties ...\nRight yeah yeah so it yeah very much just yeah very much so so uh [noise] this is a\nVery um [noise]\nI mean it's still a developing story and it is uh Mike Pence just spoke about it a little bit earlier audio somebody twenty two I mean this was maybe twenty minutes ago listen to the U.S\n[laughter] or district milk [noise] in America [noise]\nI Wonder was for the ... [noise] uh via the are the United states Secret Service they're working very closely with law enforcement officials will continue to monitor the traditions [noise]\nThose responsible will be brought to justice\nNow so I just uh to me it seems like this is a this is Tara ... it's a it's a it's a terror a\n... and it gets\nTo solve terror and now I Know that Cuomo into Blasio where we're getting into some politics with it um which I I just I think I don't know how you can do that right now because we're still determining what the heck is happening um I think that you have to make sure a people or say first be that you do we even know\nAre are all of them have all of them\nBend a secured I mean are there more out there I think before people start politicizing the issue and blaming the administration and all of that maybe perhaps they should wait\nFor more information to ... I mean there's nothing wrong with waiting to see what other information comes\nOut um I don't I mean there's there's never been anything there's no nothing wrong with that I mean there's been I mean for instance I remember back when there was a there was a run of a bomb threat on a a a whole bunch of Jewish\nCenters after um the election and it was this a disturbed it was in Israel and it was a disturbed teenager\nUh there there were the rice and letters that were sent in two thousand and fourteen to the New York city mayor into the White House that was\nThat was a scorned lover trying to frame their husband so I think it's a very important that people just kind of way and makes and wait for more information to come in before they start rushing to politicize\nThings I mean that you know that's that's that's just the nature of it and so this is\nWe're going to be this is what we're going to be we're going to be watching the story and getting developments uh from it as a as we as we get them and then there's just a lot of information coming in right now or with the White House statement McConnell statement will continue of dating you as well to the uh the caravan that still coming from through Mexico\nA swelled up to fourteen thousand um will also have making Kelly who is a apologizing for a statement that she made an argument that she made yesterday on her NBC\nShow um there was additionally and I and I want to get going here but the um K. I. R. O. channel seven\nHad reported as it is in Washington that there was a guy that made five bomb threats to state buildings and for weeks\nAnd he made one of the ... office in Olympia in Washington so it it just isn't the only and I know that they're ... and there's and I don't there's copycat stuff this happened obviously before all of this stuff today but dang\nPeople are on hinged they are absolutely unhinged right now and\nThis is not good we got a more to get into makes me want to crawl into the liberty safe you know honestly it's just the safest place in the world to be and this is the best time to get your uh liberty safe as well\nUh liberty safe is making it easy for everybody to own one uh they have some great deals they have great prices this is the number one stay for a reason in the country they've sold a two million saves\nTheir the leader in a technology and innovation in the industry that has exclusive features like military style like locking bars I hate

lifetime purchased so make the right one liberty safe dot com tell them Dana sent to you\nAt a date we know that the ones that were sent to the Obamas uh I think it was but Obama's holder and then and then there were sent to CNN too but at least four of them they have confirmed that they are a\nRelated as and it's the same uh it's the same\nIn individual apparently behind it they had a Debbie Wasserman Schultz has the return address which is weird uh the ones that Clinton as far as we're not confirmed which is why didn't include those in there\nThere's a reason why I said they're specifically only for that they've confirmed because only four of them had Debbie Wasserman Schultz the ones that Clinton and Obama ... those were completely separate so there's a reason why I said at the way I did [noise]\nUm the other thing that struck me as odd and I've been seeing some discussion about this too there was a a photo of the one that was sent to Brennan and it had a stamp uh all over the package et cetera obviously but there wasn't postage marking on the stamps\nI mean when you when you send a package and you you have stamps on it you get postage marks on the stamps right this didn't have them just didn't have any stamps on the package at all so\nWhat\nI mean think about this as well um and someone else or a bunch of people that are make that a ... a couple of other people made this point to the a pipe bomb I mean that and that can mean a number of things by the way the incendiary explosive device\nBut this particular device uses steel piping and when you're shipping a package\nYou are you're being charged by the weight of it and so\nSome individuals apparently some people who even working or have worked in the post office before they were saying well the ... wouldn't have\nCovered that everyone's speculating you know just how heavy it would have been but they all were in agreement that will do six stamps wouldn't have covered that\n... even if it went through but there were no posted posted markings on it at all whatsoever so what ... what\nI Am wondering and what other people are questioning because the Soros one was hand delivered to that facility this seems like this was also hand delivered to\nNow that makes me wonder was where the Clinton ones where's that hand delivered was\nI mean there were these I mean these were these all hand delivered\nI mean I think that that kind of um I think that's kind of a fair point to ask and also if they were is there any which I'm sure they're looking at I mean if there's any sort of security footage et cetera et cetera where you could uh um where you could\nSee the uh\nYou could see you know just exactly who it was that that did it I don't know it's just that because that strikes me as weird I mean I'm looking at this photo of this that strikes me as incredibly weird um do we have time I know it's our quick segment where time to\nKick into some quick five okay yeah let's go ahead let's got to do this good five okay so this is the latest that is happening right now aside from the developing story that we are watching at Michigan City has banned clowns on Halloween Oak Park city

coast to coast\nBeing there\nSo we're following this story\nThis uh all of these these bombs that were sent to a number of individuals and a a entity so there was CNN Debbie Wasserman Schultz Eric Holder the Obamas the Clintons John John Brennan but John Brennan's was sent to CNN which is weird because he's an M. S. N. B. C. contributor so that would that stupid\n[noise] um the other thing that I'm looking at is how the package that was sent for instance one that was such a John Brennan at CNN has six stamps on it and none of the stamps have posted marks this wasn't males\nThis was hand deliver\nAnd is it true that if you're ... if you're emailing if you're sending a package and it's like this heavy do you got to put it in a box or do you can you just put it and like the puppy out because I'm getting both sides of that on on social media do you does it have to go into a box or do you have to and the reason that I Am because\nI'm at well but it's almost a moot at this point because it wasn't\nIt was it was it was handled it right it wasn't mailed\nI mean that I Can't and I don't know if\nHe fixes enough is six stamps enough of this 'cause it's a steel parts on it this is a ... at this particular image that the picture that they showed an ... that's what was in the package\nThat has some heavy metal parts on it that has some steel parts on it so uh that seems like it would be a little too heavy for just six stamps\nI don't I'm just me uh but we don't know how much it actually wait which I'm sure they'll let that no I you know they're gonna they're gonna be looking at every bit of a closed circuit footage possible\nThey are going to be looking at every bit of footage possible\nSo this is a no yeah that somebody had said you had a great big ah video hunt begins that's true it does now but I've never because I've never\nGotten anything through any postal service that didn't have marketing tolerate someone said well some of them are invisible marking no they're not they're not stop there or not\nThey are\nI had a couple of people who have message may just literally just since like we've been on breaking who worked in one retired and\nOne will not say that actively still and they and they had said that they would have marked on them if it was ...\nAnd and and the one who still works are brought up the fact that it wasn't in a box so even if they had brought it and I thought they would not have mailed it being that heavy if it was a heavy metal item unless it was in a box so that's why I bring that up\nWhich is sort of strip searched we covered it which we don't really do but the where you are not able to reuse stamps is because we put those markings on their friend you might not be able to feed them with the naked eye but under black white or other environments you can see well you have to market so you don't reuse\nAnd there's nothing on this so I and I I think that's you know it's important to [noise] uh the other thing\nWith this is an ... is the\n... and I'm thankful that nothing detonated and I'm sure we're going to hear more information about\nAbout all of it nothing detonated\nAnd\nI'm just still I mean we're getting more and more developments in the president's apparently are going to be making some remarks about this and we'll take it lie when it happens but and I'm looking here that I see another I see another uh a picture of it of the device um\nI mean it's a pipe bomb I mean that's that I mean that's the deal that yeah the the the\nIndividual that I was referring to her message me and said they still work with the post office had said if you're going to mail something if you know not pipeline if you're going to mail a heavy piece of metal like that\nThan it would be you would you'd have to put it in a box they're not going to just lay stuff it and one of those little bubbly on blow up some and mail it and that's just not going to happen but I still say this is I Do think ah\nI Do think that this is absolutely I mean it's some sort\nOf um it is domestic terrorism I don't know how she put it it's domestic terrorism so\nIt workshop dot com dot com\n[noise] looking back now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One person at a time\nBombs flow\nBack to do on the radio show today we've been talking about um\nDifferent aspects of why your life is so mediocre and you know you think about it go like the ideal man lay off me\nAnd and my point of view is look\nIf you wanted me to lay off of you you wouldn't listen to the park yeah she really listening 'cause it's caught your attention I Know when I listen to guys that are bombastic and um when I listen to guys that really are way ahead of me financially and it's like they they look back where you're at and they talk about\nYou know I really didn't get it back then I had really figured it out yet I feel that same way at every level at every level of come through\nBeing more and more successful from the very beginning when I quit my job and was able to survive on my single family houses to when I bought my small apartment complexes uh and started learning more and more money and then I bought medium size apartments and larger apartment support at every level that I passed through I Want you to understand\nThat every level was an additional learning curve\nEvery level created fear\nYou know I I was just scared to buy a single family houses when I started with them\nBut I was just excited the returns that I was getting from those single family houses if you're out there and you're a beginner and you're listening to this big numbers I'd throw around it's you know get a religious Thirty years of doing this so it's really not I'm not even proud to throw that out I probably should have ten times more money than what I have I just wasn't that aggressive\nUm but if you're back they're starting to rise started out where most people start at is that you and you got to get out there and you've got to just change your mind you need to self educate yourself that's the most important thing\nAnd then you need to start thinking about your family's wealth as a business and not think about your family's money as little bill is college fund forget little Billy if you're a millionaire by the time Billy goes to college don't you think you can afford to send Billy to college\nDon't save for college buying a barber complex and make enough money in that apartment complex can not only make you rich for pay his way through college\nWhen he's done with college you'll still have the apartment complex you still have the income and it'd be worth even more so get rid of the little Billy college fund\nGet rid of the um the ... retirement fund you don't need a retirement fund\nYou don't need a pile of money sitting there doing nothing for you to die with or to rather live off of before you die you need investments what you need to do is replaced short earned income would pass ... get that money out of the four one K. get it out of the IRA\nDopey uh Dave Ramsey fool and pay off your home get the money out of your personal house that money could earn enough money to retire on what is the house do anyway sheet rock carpet and pain it's nothing you can live anywhere\nBut what you can't do as replace your income if you don't have any money to invest you need to get out there and get the money that you have invested you need to think about your family as a business what is your business your family's business producing\nIt producing anything yes or no\nIf it's not producing why\nWhy are you letting it you're the c._e._o. of your company will sit down at dinner tonight and go okay family\nI had a paycheck this month maybe mother had a paycheck this month I'm and we're in twelve cents on our savings ... dead why don't we have any other passive income I listen to this crazy don't want to see in the radio and many other people why is that we don't have any passive income Wilson\nI'm scared I'm stupid I'm lazy\nIt's got to be one of the three easier too scared to try you're too stupid to figure it out even with all the education that's out there or you're too lazy to even get up and dry\nIt's gotta be one of three so tell your kids sit down tonight at the dinner table and tell your kids kids I'm either too stupid too lazy\nOr to de do stupid too lazy what was the other ones that are not going to get this thing done period that's all there is to\nI'm not going to do it for us I'm going to let you guys grow up and be just like me work for the rest of your life from age twenty four the age Seventy eight eighty years old now\n\nI'm not going to help you I'm not going to teach you how to make money I'm not going to\nBuild the families well do you think about generation after generation one of the things I wanted to bring up with something you don't even see that's mortgage reduction\nThat's another way we make money I remember getting excited about it that when I had a lot of property so I don't remember exactly how many properties ahead but I was looking at a situation where I was making a hundred thousand dollars a year and mortgage reduction in five hundred dollars a year mortgage production at the peak when I was a lot of problems I think maybe had like a hundred or a a\nI'm Sorry a million dollars with a mortgage production principal ... and you don't see that million bucks or that five hundred thousand or even that ten or twenty whatever you're earning whatever you're paying down you don't see it but it's there\nTo get out your balance sheet each month and go wow the mortgages down the value was up my equity is up\nDo you look at do you have financial statements do you have a balance sheet do you ever resume do you have a list of all of your investments that you look at I look at them three or four times a month\nAs different payments come in each time a payment come and go back to my calculation I keep track of how much I'm earning on all my passive income investments to the to the penny each month I compare them I compete them I tried to make them better every month\nI keep track of all of my earned income that I ... I tried to make that better\nAll of my business income I Try to track all my I Do track all my business income and then I put them all together in one giant spreadsheet where I have all of my businesses all of my or didn't start with earned income than business income\nThat interest in income than a rental income\nAdam altogether and that's my total income for the month slash total income for the year if you're not tracking your results like that every month\nNot paying attention then you're not doing your family services [noise] think about what I said don't be\nWildly judges will be back tomorrow and the number always she's not the money is [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nYou know mom's radio show every\nGet obtained or would you want to seven days we can't get enough to go on the radio not God Bless you [laughter] know bosley radio show will join the conversation [noise]\nThe proceeding was a pain program paid for by lifestyles unlimited the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceedings programs are not those of W H ... am its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated calm\nThe president's speech he also said this audio soundbite and this is what made people mad 'cause I think he said this after this was later on audio soundbite nine listen\nTo me he also has a responsibility [noise] just several\nStop the endless hostility a constant negative and oftentimes false attacks insurers have to do [laughter]\nMm [noise]\nWell an goodness\nI ... I mean it is he's right\n... responsibility every it whenever you talk about who has a responsibility it should be everybody but apparently some and media I think it's only tromp and only conservative which again I Want to point you back to history let's look back at history here goodness [noise] but I like what the president said yesterday\nI I you know what else you know it doesn't help when I hear some of the other stuff you have ... you have um I'm just as soon as\nWe have a lot of really Crazy Artist you have to Blasio who blames tromp I had Chuck Todd who blame Trump Cuomo who blame Trump able Ryan who blames Trump\nUh\nSee here everybody everybody here to see who didn't blame Trump actually\nYeah you know what you're right it would be a I think it would be easier at this point to stay who didn't\nWe could just pretty much say all the mainstream media that we know of immediately came out with it was Trump's for I mean it didn't take more than ... minutes\nYeah well I Wonder if they Seventeen for you because this was as a flashback after the attempted assassination at the congressional ball fields when Nancy Pelosi came out and defended her party listen\nSo again I let's go there another day but since you asked how could they possibly say such as first of all the timing of it all\nEverybody is so sad so concerned so coming together let us all take a step back to examine our own conscience see what a um\n[noise] negative attitude can we can all to tail\nShe was saying it's no it's not and I don't say and I think the question of what had been posed a her was whether or not she felt that anyone 'cause I don't think anyone had even said Democrats known even had even said that but the this was the thing [noise] why is that grace not extended\n\nWe and we don't let us know about this whoever's by now than we did we know about I just can't then\nI mean it's not like the guy was quiet on line it's not like you didn't have social media pages where he legit with spelling out why he was mad\nIt's not like there weren't witnesses all around the ball field that all told police the same thing when he said he was screaming about how Republicans were trying to kill people with health care I mean this is these are\n\nThe point is as we know less about this whoever's doing this and we do\nThis I mean it's it's just it's it's just insane [noise]\nAh [noise] so I I don't know that none of that's helping that kinda stuff that we hear from a all you know from from\nWhat April Ryan and build a ... ... and ... when Cuomo Chuck Todd\nI'm all of this is not helping\nI think right now we need to figure out who did it hunt them down and bring them in and make sure that other people are safe cause I\nThey're probably more packages out there I'm thinking that they're likely there is there are more out there I just can't see that it's there there isn't at this point\nI'm\nHillary Clinton made remarks yesterday\nOn this saying that we it's time for unity at the time for sixteen days ago\nShe told everyone that we're not going to be civil unless Democrats win the election and you can't be civil with people who ... who disagree with you\nThese are

some of the other males there were jealous of her I think that they were upset that she was given you know such a big contract and all of this and they were not that's what I honestly think\nAnd they were just nasty about it the entire time the entire time\nBut I also think I didn't like around that time slot and I did not like her as I as a feature style reporter she's a hard news person she is

people that the scooter you know at that time and since then two and a lot of them pointed to the same issue so I don't know I mean I'm just speculating from the outside looking in but I think the environment at Fox was a little bit different when she was considering leaving that it is today\nYeah oh definitely I Would definitely say that as a but it it's just yeah\nI uh\nI I think she should have I think she should have stayed there but the way that I mean it was like it whenever I read stuff about it\nUm\nI always I always felt like a mean girls club wherever I read anything about him the NBC [noise] and then did you see how\nDelicately they wanted to cover her what she was talking about what how they were different times and it was amazing to see\nI Am so sick and tired of these
