W agency [noise]\nIt\nWas when I was about as big as we've ever seen\nIn history we've never had anything like this\nIs actually pretty close pretty close [noise]\nOr they might hear quite a bit about where Michael rang historically [noise]\nNow ... what you hear the top five ... not quite in terms of recorded hurricanes in us history but by name storms that is the case here's the deal we've had in Atlantic hurricane season that we've tracked since Eighteen fifty one\nBut they didn't start naming hurricanes until Nineteen fifty three All right so\nYou actually had the strongest hurricane that's ever been recorded in us history\nThat was a name to it was the Labor Day hurricane Nineteen thirty five\nO'clock in with tops who said when's the last couple hundred and eighty five miles per hour\nThe second one was hurricane care Nineteen sixty two top with one Seventy five\nThen you have a ... for the third strongest hurricane at the time of land fall hurricane Camille Nineteen sixty

they're one of the other things so much for two and we heard the death toll earlier today\nLebanon twelve and a lot of concerns that number's going to rise one thing ... or like in in Florida we do off in a really good job\nOr minimizing death at the time of impact of a hurricane but often will see a bunch of people that will go out there in in make mistakes after hurricane\nThey'll end up dying that's been four to track record historically really easy by the way when you're hot you're tired you don't have power to go do something silly\nThat sometimes it just didn't include stepping in water bottle or something with a downed power lines I kind of thing happens and the case of what we're taking a look at the with the with hurricane Michael\nWhat we don't know how many people were actually in those homes Mexico Mexico beach and uh let's pray that folks did get out and that we're going to have a adept told the rises considerably\nTomorrow and over the weekend this one was bad bad news for sure\nAll right and the end on a lighter note I ah\nCouldn't help but the but they go actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West\nAnd as a when I was doing radio in Savannah\nDuring the Iraq War the folks you saw in Baghdad or toppling the statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third of the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we have the Iraq War going on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a rap station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta\nAnd so he's got a big deal in Georgia he was just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War and\nI go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked up and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West's song\nAnd he couldn't remember my name and he went it's it's it's Whitey with the news and I became Whitey with the news\nAnd I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kinda turned it into a thing and for for many couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up helping me with culture and so I Would do things like ah you know learn how to to speak the language\nI'd just be a chilling the stuff you know ... those were the types of things that I was doing in in in Kanye West was at the forefront of my urbanized education\nAnyway I digress a it has been a couple of weeks for short from the galvanized situation or gun yet and the oval office but you know the only thing that's changed and the grand scheme of things not even so much the stock market\n[noise] what's really change is that we're a little more than three weeks away from election day [noise] and Republicans got a chance [noise] not only to a game in the Senate but the whole house you got to get out there and you got to vote [noise] been an honor to pleasure always\nIs have a wonderful weekend [noise] within back next week fry much for the gray one more go this\n\n\nListen bought our first I ... [noise]\nYou've not been able to win a World Series he is not pitched you to anything and that's the issue he has not pitched you into the next round he's not he's not had a boy here's a game seven complete game from Clinton cursor he's been okay he's had big games where he has lost most of them were to the cardinals in the play offs but he has had many big games where he's lost really thought\nJay tonight really thought no cardinals this was when he could get over\nYou know central apparently but if you got a game like tonight where hey here's game one of the NFL cs and\nYou're losing I mean it's\nIt's five one Milwaukee all five runs you know we're we're charge the Clayton Kirk Shaw and\nThis is what you get if he drops out\nThis is why we set it right before game one of the series against the Braves with the Dodgers you let him opt out if this is them trying to push him out that's fine too because\nYou can show it gives you a level of excellence in the playoffs and he's the same ... and the regular season and he's the same picture in the playoffs that was Peyton Manning he gave me the same he was the same starting week three as he was started the AFC Championship game\nThat was paid because he played at one level the whole time but in the playoffs everybody raises their game they find a way to raise their game and so that's why you walk into oh here's why Peyton Manning has a five hundred years this defense that probably couldn't stop them week six this is the one that's going to stop near and weak Eighteen in individual round the playoff game in the wild card game whenever it was\nAnd it's the same thing with ... you get to the playoffs everybody asks things up it's longer at ... guys with a better strategy against them and Clinton her short just has not delivered and for a guy that you're depending on who you're giving thirty million dollars to go by the way missed\nA third of it starts this year with more injuries with another back injury his back is not going to get better if you're pushing them out if you'd like in the test free agency in science someplace else let him go the Dodgers need to move on without him\nThe other two pictures they've had so far to pitch in the playoffs we're both better that rich hill is rich hill but Walker bealer looks like a future star\nAnd Rio is really good in the in the first playoff game and he's pitch grade all year\nThe future without curse Shaw is okay if you're the Dodgers but you're seeing tonight why again you can't count on him you can't ... hey Kurt shows out there that's a win for us no curse all goes out there and in the playoffs you're just as likely to get away from ... Shaw\nAs you are a loss he's a five hundred pitcher in the playoffs that's not what you can expect or hope to try to win games when series if that's what you're counting on your number one started ... the margin of error\nIs that much of last year and looking at the defense and foibles and Follies behind the plate catchers interference she got a couple of past falls you you're looking at everything else is conspiring against you and when he's not sharp it spirals out of control in a hurry and forget about the\nThe home read aloud to the relief pitcher for alone with ... with that often if aside for just a minute you you look at each struggled with control you you haven't been getting the big strike out numbers in and it was great and it was masterful the last round but you've got to be able to rear back and you got to be able to\nAt done blow hitters away and come playoffs you you got to find your your your place one of the ... said hey you got to an exotic geo that's it and he's done\nAnd we're going to go bowling panning and we're in the fifth inning are already at heater time and his hundred and thirty seven mile an hour in Baton Rouge so great council just saying oh we've got um expose you got the juggler exposed we're going after it\nOr getting our guys in a bullpen pitch to a sub to erase of September first let's just keep at it\nWith Clayton her show now you've got the big decisions of right wing games during the regular season nine wins I didn't get the double digit wins nine two seven three are a is a nominal spectacular but\nWinning time I mean it's not the ... one point seven seven oh I get it but I digress okay what else it wasn't reunions at one point one five yeah but I only for a while but I can but I can come over to that to happen\nThese and it was you know if you're going to keep trying to jam a guy anyway as magazine equal based around ... going to go round and round\nOf rubber sorry got thanks plenty good Richard you want to go to Sam\nDollars while you're right ... yeah right I mean\nYou've got big decisions here 'cause you got to decide you want Machado do you want to go after Bryce Harper do you want to go and continue on that side of things saying the kids are All right on the pitching side some prospects plus review last\nYou've you've got your guy you're is coming back right he made the roster or your banking on him to go into the rotation next year you got Walker Beulah you've got a base going forward and that thirty three million dollars could be split up elsewhere even if it's just to bring in another big box\nTwitter at how about a fresco Mike at swollen dome you're seeing tonight again why you can't just rely on Clayton Kurdish ought to issue to anything\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox will keep you updated right now the brewers threatening to break this one open bottom of the fifth inning with a five one lead they have runners at first and second and just one out and Josh Nader\nIs in the on deck circle they've already gotten one home run from reliever taught that could they get another will have more on this game plus the latest in the airline manning saga we had a twist today oh yeah and I'm going to answer all my own back and critics all of you every single one way next on Fox\n[noise] the M. L. V. postseason ... style and pregnant in high in the Iran\nWe've got you covered\nFox Sports radio even if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know the first who actually peach baskets or that award basketball is bounce you're then the cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game\nWell here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nTrue car also helps people get used cars that's right ... isn't just for buying new cars with their certified dealer network and nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and a simpler buying experience whether you buy new or used\nA ... and here's this you know that he's already three on it is a A R I Know del not suffering the gay or not but either way all of that done right at a basket of goods that we say yeah there are seven\nPoints here but the reality is they didn't bother to figure out whether it was the first down they just randomly gave him a Gatorade and said it's hard enough it looked like it was close enough but yeah but these are never got bored I mean obviously it's an unofficial line but ... neither here nor there for the moment but see they actually win that game\nYesterday would have been so much I mean it's fascinating in in the dumpsters or on fire but if they want it you've been able to you would have been able to sell\nHope for three days ah it it would still be the same showing up that flat that poorly against\nThe defending champions and your division rivals maybe they would have been in in that holding it would have been that bad you know that's where short weeks are good because you have to forget you have to turn the page you were able to hear about it is done and we're moving on\nAnd there's not going to be a loss of lingers into Wednesday or Thursday 'cause we have no choice in the matter is still would have been the same thing you still would have seen this but the giants their roster is terrible so tank\nI made tank and ... and turn around and say we're the smartest guys in the world\nBecause we got say corn Barclay last year and we got hurt or whoever you want to take a number one overall usually are printing the shirts yet or what what what tomorrow tomorrow's the game where you're going to why orders today revert for Herbert oh I like that although it sure of it can do your ... sherbet for her na I don't know\nHerbert can you a ... for because the only other famous Herbert is a guy we don't want to talk about for Family Guy a will there's herb Albert\nThere's her mouth or not and the energy on her her ... her bra elder you will get your guy you'll get your quarterback and he'll be on display tomorrow against Washington watch them have this huge game if I'll give you a bit of preview into what might upset special is going to be all that someone had oh it's huge game and\nIt's going to be some of the ... guy giants fans are going to start watching Oregon gave that night\nTank tank and do it everybody else will do this is what you have you got to be ... got to be good and you want to\nCorrect this horrendous mistake you made last year where we could add San Bernardino that anybody on no no no no fake one Barclay hey go correct that mistake take the rest of the season that's how you figure things out whether he lives the quarterback or whether Phil Simms comes back to play quarterback it doesn't matter\nTank eaten dirt for Herbert I I don't know we got to go with her for her I like that yeah yeah yeah\nYeah I liked that eat dirt for Pat Pat and\nBut other than yeah I don't know there's something to hide and then we got to figure that out but certainly for the giants there's so many holes and that's the thing right and we talked about it last night you can find the pod cast up but I just Jason Smith show with my car in a given five stars will walk ... how'd you\nUh forever alongside our treasure but the fact of the matter is that you've got so many holes but the ... back in junior saga\nAllows you to just missed direct everybody 'cause that's where all the attention goes 'cause that's the better movie\nIn one minute we're more on this game going on right now the walking and the Dodgers were in the bottom of the sixth inning of cars has gotten more on this coming up and we get into the oh they'll side of this because yeah Africa today we got to have to put the effort mentioned\nIs with us now with what strengthen the safe haven chance Milwaukee has won a lemon straight trying to make it twelve and a rover was lead the Dodgers find one in game one of the national league championship series Pedro by as now and for LA on the hill rough night to Clinton cursed shah\nGave up for earned run he has money granddaughter and a couple of past falls to errors including catchers interference and also a a an Arab by Chris Taylor out in the outfield again\nBrewers are the fine one lead right now or the Dodgers there in the bottom of the six in Milwaukee and has just gone to file twenty third ranked South Florida survive by kicking a game winning feel do twenty to the art or what just a couple of takes on the clock\nSouth Florida beats Tulsa twenty five twenty four in the American athletic conference mountain west Airforce lead San Diego state nine seven one forty three to go to second quarter in the past twelve Utah out to assemble nothing home lead over Arizona six and a half to go first quarter\nYou know we don't like to find a fix for a golf game thankfully you can find a fix your check engine light at auto is on the free ... will find the likely issues saving money down the road get in his own auto zone and finally guys the diamond backs have learned inexpensive lesson\nAfter trying for more than Twenty years to grow grass in the desert in ...\nI had a stadium where the roof the diamond backs and made a logical choice they are going to synthetic turf at chase field starting next season ploy so you don't do that for Twenty years I've been trying to grow carrots\nInside my house and it's not work without soil oh or souring oh any soil down just gets about hydro hot and then they'll get ... whatever you need on tells me that [laughter] you know about them we'll live from the\nStudios were Fifteen minutes can save you a Fifteen Percent or more and car insurance for more information you can visit Geico dot com or Chris yellow which is a runner at second for the brewers are they leave the Dodgers five one as they bad in the bottom of the sixth inning\nBut continuing\nOn with the giants who still stay the big story of the day despite a the fact that they got some last night look when you're bad and when you're losing when you're in New York people pay attention either way graduations\nTo Philadelphia and Carson once for getting on track and taking advantage of the school that is the New York giants now activists as well that is the New York football giants so\nEverywhere we went we had a big dance social media today and last night we told you about ... and the deal without backroom juniors that she had he was fine before the game for his interview he gave with ESPN throwing the team under the bus on Sunday he left the game before half time when the giants officers on the field as he says to go get an IV\nHe walked off by himself to the lock them I'm pretty sure if you're drained and need an IV someone goes with you to the locker room and apparently he's the only guy that can get an IV at the at halftime because he said\nYou know you only get five minutes ten minutes at halftime you so anybody else needs an ivy you're out of luck right all the other giants need 'em at halftime don't get them because they're all getting on the off the field after the clock actually hit zero no they'll get more\nPeople on staff and James would er and Matthew Modine there's only there's more than you guys there to administer and I leaned pushed out of your life that yeah you see that as with his girlfriend too yeah people think there's this real life uh so what is it just fantasy horror movie\nHow much you want to believe out back and was the whole I don't doubt that he got an IV and a half time but that's just the way to explain away him saying look at me I'm walking off the field 'cause I'm Upset\nThat we're not winning well as you said it's all show yeah well then in the second half he does the whole show of I'm head budding and electric fan I'm yelling at it and this is your outback I miss you have to put up with knuckleheads stuff\nTo deal with his talent the giants didn't pay him Ninety million dollars to be like this and\nWhat happens is you not only have to deal with real stuff with the giants but you've got to deal with ... knuckle added stuff some of his ... his stuff is just strictly off the field and it's like okay I'll deal with that\nBut a lot of it bleeds into on the field like last night with the whole thing with him leading before halftime this became the big story why did oh they'll leave the field oh Dalai\n... said he didn't notice and then he said he didn't think too much doubt it yeah you know you I had no idea the job you ...\nAnd this is why it's easy to move on from him but the giants on him to a contract I told you painted was going to be the worst thing because he's just going to be the guy he was this is five weeks it already you thought oh he's majority is going to be elite no he was never going to mature it'd be a leader the giants got snowed because he acted\nAnd didn't do anything for three weeks and kept waiting for a new contract so it's like trying to they want it to reward a child we was behavioral problems because he behaves well for a tiny period of time all let's make sure we reward you yeah let your water\nAnd all of the back of junior saying if see that that's all I had to do with three weeks is is is not saying anything oh that was easy method that Santa my head\nBut this is ... and it makes him not worth it because everything you have to go through now the giants have to fix their team and they've got to worry about ... what he says next what he does next everything goes into with hotel\nAnd obviously there's a lot of people that love ... and ... wanted to come after me on social media today\nThe one thing I Will say that I'm absolutely sick of people saying when they say ... ... and you're ridiculous oh he's passionate he just wants to win I Can't believe you're seeing that off the field stuff that ...\nNinety nine point nine nine nine nine nine percent of players in the NFL wants to win\nEverybody wants to it and there are a couple of guys here or there no yeah there there are a couple of guys here that don't want to win but the vast majority Ninety nine percent of guys want to win because you go through so much any given week preparing for a game that you're in it with everybody else in your locker room you wanna when\nEverybody in the NFL wants to win but they all find a way to do it without being a distraction and causing controversy to their team Sam Donald wants to win just as much as\n... Bek um junior does but Sam Donald doesn't do stuff to distract from what's going on with the team same thing with Aaron Rodgers same thing with Russell Wilson same thing with Cam Newton same thing with Ben Roethlisberger all of these guys\nEverybody wants to win every player the quarterbacks that defensive backs but they also put the differences all these other players find a way to\nHold their emotions in check so they're not hitting their head against the ceiling fan against the electrical fan or hitting a kicking net or leaving before half time 'cause they're so pissed off they're not winning", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
