I have great except what I refer to is the mainstream media where people don't have the intelligence and the they don't go to that effort because they're they're on the fence they don't want for conservative is we need to get out there it'd be a competing like the local news and the mainstream media we need to get in there\nYou know Chris I I tell you what would happen ... money controls everything if CBS or ABC said from top to bottom from the top of the tree through the root system we're going to have conservative viewpoints on all of our ah channels can you imagine the ratings\nSkyrocketing said CBS News if they determine they're going to do television much like one of America's network or Newsmax or see our TV if CBS would say we're going to cover news objectively\nModerate to the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars because you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same news casts every night at six thirty if one of them\nI Would go against the fracas and reflect the values the once and the whims and the wishes of the majority of the American people wouldn't we'd be better off and when they make a lot of money\nYeah well where are the people that are being proactive enough to do that to get into the mainstream kids they these radio shows and his TV 'cause they're picking to the choir we need to change minds like they're starting to go out and go on these mainstream media because I don't know if you've got to go there\nYes and it's okay to come and be all with me it's okay to do Fox or do my friend Sean Hannity now mark ... Ben might get them on on a Sunday night on Fox on the radio\nBut but he needs to go out and this guy is wonderful the sixty minutes interview he took was Lee solar powered on Sunday I thought it was fabulous and he's he's his own but the guy's amazing in his presence he looks to be fifty and not Seventy in his presence\nYou know it's like it's like being with Elvis and Nineteen sixty eight in a while it's like the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show it's like beyond said metlife stadium this is a superstar when you get in the presence\nOf Trump is like the messiah it's it's unbelievable and I've never seen this in politics I wasn't old enough during the Kennedy era Ronald Reagan yes I Want the Reagan rally in Nineteen eighty four\nPretty good but there's nothing in politics that equals a Trump rally and that's why you can go to Montana Iowa Erie, Pennsylvania Cincinnati Georgia Florida ain't going anywhere\nAnd draw one hell of a crowd I Wonder what would happen if the Trump stir one to Central Park in New York City I Wonder what that would be like\n... I Wonder if I asked him he took that stall apart\nYou know she she was a ... to ... you know and this is off the subject but I there are so well irony in the end is because there are certain there kissing him going after young prosecutes theirs is competitor and boy as he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me up\nPeople she's also an old white woman over the foreigners but she's younger than those two old white people do and she also because she has it been in government as long as they have she's sort of looks knew but she is as extreme if not more than Bernie Sanders\nAnd\nLess transparent Bernie is stupidly trends parrot\nAnd I'm not saying that that as though transparency is a bad thing I'm just saying he doesn't have\nGreat political argument because that requires I think hyper smart to do that and it was this one doesn't really have it either as she's proven by her tripling down on all of this nonsense still going off on Twitter and that but this is so much bigger than us if she would have run\nAs everyone thought she was going to last cycle I think she would have knocked Hillary out of contention and it would have been between those in the foreign and Bernie Sanders [noise]\nI really think that because Warren has more support in the Democratic base and Hillary Clinton does and I would argue did at the time\nBecause uh the only reason that Hillary was still even\nUm at some point a contender which because Bill Clinton\nWas raising money and could raise a lot of money for Democrats and now they don't care because you know they're not they're not entertaining her anymore because she's not going to do anything but that's an Elizabeth Warren could have run that was before the Kamala Harris as it was before Cory Booker really became Spartacus that\nIt it's before the Swalwell it's before really all of those individual kind of tried to out crazy each other to take center stage and so you might ask well why in the world is she doing this because she's not up for re election right now\nIt's not a presidential cycle it's still a little bit early to be positioning yourself that much in a race that's still a couple of years off why\nIs she doing this and I think it's because people forgot she existed because she's she's on the Senate Judiciary committee and who we are the people that everybody was watching the last couple of weeks Senate Judiciary committee who are the people that were making headlines the Senate Judiciary committee\nOver and over and over again who are the people that were you know questioning you know the sessions is and who were the questioning the cabinet is the first time around who are the people that question to Gorsuch all the Senate Judiciary committee and so these individuals have been in the news for a really long time\nAnd\nShe was not getting her headline she was not keeping her name out there because she's not on that committee so she had to think of something how in the world\nCan I maintain some relevancy get my name in the headlines and make it look\nLike I Am ... I Am a contender and then I Am better than the Kamala Harris isn't the Spartacus as well I'll do this I Will I Will walk so far down this path to a certain ... certain point and do this\nAnd I think also there's this perception amongst Democrats that whoever can go toe to toe with Trump\nAnd vanquish him politically that the savior of the Democrat Party I think they're all trying to audition for that in various ways and that's what I think all\nContributes to why Elizabeth Warren did what she did and with this stupid DNA test [noise]\nAnd that is ... I mean that's that's kind of the that's the way of that so\nShe was doing this because she needed to get her name out there and she also wanted to be seen as a person who could think wish Trump\n\nBut it kind of backfired it totally backfire and it looked absolutely ridiculous I mean you have oh Cherokee Nation which cannot you have a bunch of ...\nWas a Democrat socialist there had to call 'em out I don't remember where 'cause I don't care enough falling or they had a column I were they were criticizing her I'm not going to kill\nMy brain cells are bringing some fairly legible just trope I'm not doing it about Democrats\nI'm not reading it because I better things to do and I just don't care that much there are certain things I just don't have enough energy to care that much about and that's one of them all you need to know some Democrats socialist was criticizing her because\nThey thought it was bad it was bad\nShe may have actually ticked off her on base you know her own base that the people that get mad oh my gosh speaking of which hold up hold on hold up\nI Can't believe I Would add this long to bring this up so you guys know Hulu right I Swear this goes into everyone knows who right I don't ever watch Hulu\nTo be honest\nI Do and I don't I don't at all watch Hulu Netflix all the Roku and Amazon Prime I've never used to I just don't because it has stuff on television and I think most televisions crap so I don't really watch it you know what I mean\nYeah yeah I'm not into that room at two in the cold medicines you want to check it out I don't care\nSo Hulu who decided to do something really stupid\nThey ah tweeted something last night\nAs about those early evening and who knew that the subscription TV service they tweeted quote\nSuitcases just makes it a grocer\nLike on a spit is one thing in a suitcase we're you know what I mean like it changes the context changes that\nIt was a fully cook pig's head split into two found that season destroyed according to the agency they ah do you as a customs and border protection agriculture specialist they found it on October eleventh would they're highly trained little legal name hearty or wherever where he's already to beagles [noise]\n... yeah you can't bring in that kinda stuff from outside of the country and just don't fly with a roasted pigs had just [noise] I mean seriously [noise]\nDon't and this is really cool or it was reported that cause waffle house does a lot for communities and they they stay open twenty four hour they stay open even when they're storms out do you know the uh the one that was in um one of the wealth of houses in the Carolinas North Carolina uh\nActually went there helping with recovery operations they sent a truck outside of one of their restaurants that was really hit in Panama City a kind of destroyed by hurricane Michael and they've been giving away meals\nTo people which is so awesome gosh I Love waffle house aren't there just the best not even an argument they are and while everyone's freaking out over a anything Trump does\nThe U.S now ranks at the top of ideals states and the U.S is now the world's most competitive economy for the first time in a decade [noise] we're going to discuss that as well\nAs give you a quick round up of the Texas Senate debate between Robert or work and Ted Cruz stay with us [noise]\n\n\nSince opening the Nineteen Ninety five Cal Tech has pioneered the concealed carry style of handguns and created cutting edge ... rifles and shotguns Celtic mission is to create innovative\nQuality firearms to help that your your worlds he'll take as an anomaly and the fire on industry because they don't manufacture gun based on market research or profit driven incentive every firearm that leave their cocoa Florida facility has been expertly and uniquely designed flawlessly manufactured and rigorously tested to provide a sense of security for every\nPerson who uses them they based their products on innovative design and creative passion\nThere still much more than just gun manufacturers their weapons developers who designed and craft reliable quality firearms some of my personal favorites or the chaos gee twenty five shock on the already be asked for survival pop and the ... the California which is the politically correct version of the ...

I had my full on conversion to read form and can't I don't know if you're aware\nThat's when I completely became have\nSeen people that are complaining about the same people to call him names and don't respect the presence we'd like they say oh Trump should respect me off to the president would clearly have not been doing that if you are you lead by example or us to you if you\nYeah I agree so now there we are [noise] uh let's see a couple of things here are some very good things by the way we're concerned the economy\nNow we have them and pull up I have two stories here for you because we've you know this is going to be an economic election also just as much as it is it's actually ... you know a\nJust as much as it is a a sort of like a cabinet lost that election you know so the two things first the world Economic Forum conducted a study and they say the United states rings closest to ideal state\nBut I thought that we were all supposed to be like Europe right wasn't didn't everyone um didn't everyone wants to think\nThat we're supposed to be like Sweden or something or Norway or something to that effect\nSo according to the world Economic Forum study of global rankings the United states a week for the first time since the two thousand in a financial crisis\nUnder the new framework for competitiveness released Tuesday us achieve the closest to competitiveness frontier or ideal state with a score of eighty five point six\nSingle warhead eighty three okay Germany had eighty to Switzerland headed to Japan had eighty two and they're talking about really economic freedom as well and they the tools map competitiveness through a bunch of indicators\nThey look at infrastructure they look at institutions the adoption of information communications technology macroeconomic stability health skills product labor or product market labor market financial system market size business uh uh innovation et cetera et cetera et cetera all good things\nRight that's all great and it's\nWe are the most competitive economy for the first time in a decade that's what this means it is the now the most competitive country in the world number one at the ... the world Economic Forum\nDid add a little ...\n\nWelcome back no here's some more money conventional wisdom says you know the man on a mission to retire American one version of moms he\nLooking back to do on the radio show with me here today Scott an offshoot of Houston market he's one of our multifamily mentors there and Scott\nWe been talking about the opportunities here nationwide how we really opened up the you know the the opportunities by going to all these different cities [noise]\nHowever you uh make mentioned that there have been some very favorable metrics in the Houston area market and a one or two show with us you know do you believe in your heart or for the people that put out the metrics do they believe that we've bounced that we hit the bottom were coming back\n[noise] yeah so the large brokers ... all these guys do quarterly a presentations on where they're saying the market at some of the metrics that I picked out of those\nThat I think really form a bottom up turn at what we're seeing here are are taking shape and they seem to be across the board these guys are all saying it\nUh one of the things I have to say a Curtis is chasing a class say I know you've got a bucket list that you want to buy class say and I have had conversations with both of you think telling you that you're crazy why would you want to go after this when things are so good in the ... and see that's the bread and butter word that's got us where we are\nFor the last twenty five years however uh I have a solid B plus property and the Galleria area and while Eighteen months ago I thought there was such a big gap between the rental property and the new construction and classic stuff that we were going to be immune\nDownward pressure from these guys as they've done a great job of over building\nA really having to deal out huge concessions to get their places filled up\nI didn't think we'd feel it at my place there but we did and it it's not bad it's not um bearable but but we felt it now what's happening in this class say stuff things that a year ago I was seeing all around me and I live right in that area too so I I watch it\nUm things that were thirty percent occupied and giving three months free Fifteen months it's starting to farm up I went and did a search on my own after I saw the data come out of these guys and I looked at all those places on a subscription service that I I look at\nAnd they're all Seventy Seventy five even eighty five percent now there's a new batch of them coming online now that some of them are blow ten percent because they just come on line right by my house\nUh inside the loop there but the stuff that I thought struggling a year ago it's farmed up and some of those things have even been able to refinance now that they're above Seventy five percent were usually we think Ninety percent of the magic number on our stuff so the capital\nThe banks agencies wherever the financing we're starting to back these deals in a\n... and it looks like they're they're saying a bottom there's one deal on the market right now [noise] person built it for a hundred Seventy five thousand a couple of years ago before things turned out they could have sold it for two ten but they were holding out because their goal was to twenty five to thirty five\nNow they've got an aspiring alone and they're going to bail out of it for a hundred and eighty five thousand door they still make ten thousand adore building that deal about the person to buying it firmly believes that of the next five years we're going to see a return and they're going to be able to sell that for two twenty five or something like that within the next five years so\nI think the model that you and Curtis have actually been chasing I've been wrong on it and I think you guys have had the forward vision a little better than I have and\nThings like ah those classes rights are up a couple of percentage points now the margin between the the rats on the rents are starting to grow again I've seen my occupancy growing in the gallery at that project I was talking about so everything's starting to shape up really well\n[noise] you know just for those who are listening for the first time you're not saying by costs the apartment complex for a hundred and Seventy five thousand they're seeing a hundred and Seventy five to two hundred and twenty five thousand per door that means per unit [laughter]\n... [laughter] yeah 'cause\nI was looking at looking at the one the other day of class as I can do if there's a big difference for between a syndicator in a in an Ira and I'm I'm trying to bite is not a real I don't know I may have to syndicate one just to do one\nBut I'm trying to do it as an Arab preferred to that way but the differences is that there becomes the depth of cash you can actually come up with\nIt so you look at these things is okay let's say it's a hundred and fifty thousand or door that's a decent number\nAnd you know you got two hundred units that's thirty million dollars right\nBut if you got three hundred units that's forty five million dollars and that's a big difference when you got to put twenty five percent ... percent closing costs you're talking thirty percent of thirty million compared to thirty percent of forty five million that's half the difference in what you have to come up with\nAnd so I found that you know I'm not afraid to buy the expensive stuff\nBut I don't think I could buy the three and four hundred unit once that makes sense\n[noise] Oh absolutely you're talking about a different ... five million dollars and those two scenarios that you played out there that's a lot a lot of cash come up with and\nIt's a situation where I think you're dealing with slightly lower returns that were used to it on a on a year to year basis however I think there's big capital gain that's out there at the end of the rainbow for those deals\nWell the you know it makes sense given given both of those or neither of those are the way I look at it as is\nTen years from now classes will be classy minus or a class B plus and they will be the center of the market\nNo doubt there will be building properties are going to be you know selling like you say two hundred two hundred and fifty thousand or people will be paying three thousand bucks a month or read it's going to happen that there's no doubt about it it's going to happen and so [noise] if you think about it\nWhen I first got ... got I was buying sixties and seventies construction I bought seventies really cool no see I got started eighty seven eighty eight eighty nine that area so I was buying stuff in Seventy ... ten years old this is not bad\nUh by the time I'd been in ten years I was buying stuff in the seventies and started buying stuff in the eighties\nAnd I thought ... construction was like wow clasby stop this is incredible does unbelievable but man we're we're not talking about two thousand Seventeen I mean that stuff is now like dead it's fifty sixty years old somewhere those buildings you have to wear out and give up and go away so\nIt's going to appreciate you coming on the show today thank you for coming on thank you for being a mentor even though he turned us down twice\nSpent a lot of fun [laughter] All right thanks a lot for the rest of you out there remembered this Scott myself in all other lifestyle\nMembers are not doing the dishes for much will do it a little less to have a wonderful day [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nThank you for your your mom radio show memory\nYou'll get obtained there was no you can join in seven days and we can't get enough to go on the heels not God was mostly radio show on and join the conversation [noise]\n\nThe information and opinions you hear on the Dell on the radio show or does it does ... his gas and his colors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions at this station its affiliates it's management or advertisers the ... for entertainment purposes only please consult a professional regarding your personal investment\nNeal proceeding was the paint program paid for by lifestyles unlimited be opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W H ... am its staff management or parent company I heart media and corporate\nWelfare west hell\nOn our first I ...
