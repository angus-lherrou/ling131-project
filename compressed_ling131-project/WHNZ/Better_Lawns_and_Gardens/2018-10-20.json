{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "But what I Am saying is is probably time to look at your portfolio rethink what you're doing and then the last segment I made a comment because we are talking about meeting with our clients and how we help them and I made a statement that happiness\nIs having a steady paycheck right this is as being able to know that your money is going to be there when you need to know that you'll never run out you know my my mother used to say\nI'm afraid I'm going to live to how does she do here doing great but she's a phrase you lived along she was never afraid to living a long time what that means that she was afraid of outliving her money right I'm afraid of living too long\nThis is the number one concern for people so as you go through this all the time the number one thing you want to do is think about protecting some of your money is not the time to take everything you have and go you know pedal to the metal in the stock market it was that time before\nIt's not that time now what I'm saying taught unfortunately is we were the CPR program will have a lot of callers from the show which is wonderful I Love meeting people I Love city with people and I like talking about finances of financial geek I think\nBut would that being said what I'm seeing with almost everyone that comes with the door is your portfolios are invested in my opinion typically in the wrong places\nThat you could be doing either much better or how much less risk or overall uh there's so much room for improvement and I'm telling you I mean people coming and they've been with advisor Fifteen Twenty years I mean people that come in managing money have been doing it for Twenty years himself smart people\nA room for improvement there's always room for improvement don't close your eyes and think that I'm okay and then we go through another two thousand eight and you're sorry\nYou know let me equate this to physical exercise\nIf you have the same routine all the time if if you if you talk to a doctor is if you talk to a physical therapists a ... a trainers\nThey'll tell you that you you need to mix up your exercises alley you don't want to do the same thing constantly and I think the same thing goes for finances at what if you're just in the same\nTrajectory the same rut then you're on that same hamster wheel over a long period of time well what if what if you're in on the wrong hamster wheel\nWell even more importantly what I'm seeing you know we adjust portfolio we stay up with things we we're one of the few independent firms actually have the\nUh the financial managers internal and house with us as saves our clients money it allows us to make good decisions in a timely manner is a right way to do things what I'm seeing is people are investing with your professional advisors in the wrong places I mean places that have so much risk\nYou know you look at the world you got the United states you've got international you've got emerging markets you've got real estate you that technology you have all these places you could invest some of those are good and some of those are bad and what most financial advisors do Todd is they put a little bit of everywhere\nThat's not healthy why would you invest in something you expect to go down\nYou know you know I expect them all to go up by what we can do is sit together look at your portfolio and say well look this is good here but maybe you need an improvement there or\nA risk is a big deal with the I Know my my goal was that you get your destination is safely as possible and and maybe just maybe you're not doing that and and what we sat together for a few minutes\nAnd we had a nice meeting and I was able to show you how to maybe find a safer way to accomplish their goals is that worth an hour of your time\nYou know so so it is important to come in it's important to have the right balance in life and you're right if you exercise the same muscle over and over a year not healthy that doesn't make you healthy is the balance of makes you healthy that's what we can show you how to do and we can show you how to do it\nIn a challenging market like this\nI think much safer than what you're doing I say a thing because I haven't seen your portfolio we haven't met yet\nBut but I I bet you that we can teach you some things that are simply going to make you do better and that's the most important thing about CPR is the ability to come in and improve because we spent time together\nAnd it's a simple process a lot of people are I I use that hamster wheel in the same exercise regimen and\nThey haven't made adjustments and the fact is is that\nGood investing requires active eyes and I love the fact Bob that you know your team you're

show we're we're delighted to be connected to you\n\nAnd it doesn't give me any pleasure to report the story\nHarvard is recalling or retracting dozens of studies or by a very well how can I put it up to this point anyway respected noted cardiac researcher\nAbout thirty one studies that a doctor Pierre Pierre ... and ... and ...\n... conducted\nAccording to Harvard contain fabricated or falsified data oh he's\n\nA doctor adverse to popularize the idea of stem cell treatment for damaged tarts\nUm\nHe's a prominent investigator researcher at the Harvard School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and there are saying straight out that he fabricated or falsified data in thirty\nOne published no less studies and that those studies need to be retracted officials at both Harvard and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said\n\nDr ... and ... are produced research suggesting that damage heart muscles or have the ability to be regenerated\nUsing stem cells stem cells are those cells from all which all other sells them\n\nAnd I ... and\nThese stem cells can trans a it's a type of cell that can transform itself as I'm just told you into a variety of other cells\nTurns out\nAnd this is what happens replication and science is a very important principle your findings need to be replicated\nAnd\nOther laboratories have not been able to reproduce Dr ... versus a finding a doctor and versus work led to the formation of start up companies\nTo develop new treatments for heart attacks and strokes and it inspired a clinical trial funded by the national institutes of health my God this is a scandal\n\nQuote a couple of beers a couple of papers may be alarming but thirty one additional papers in question is almost unheard of said doctor said uh Ben Ben why Brent all associate professor of cardiovascular research at Gladstone Institute's in San Francisco\nDr Bernard said it it it is a labs almost entire body of work\nAnd therefore almost an entire field of research put into question\nClose quote what what about the patients man what about all those are all on a twist about this guy's credentials\nIn the lab being is what about the people that believe than this and and had that treatment\nWhat about them less we forget them\nHarvard Medical school and bring it on and Women's Hospital began to review of Dr ... versus a publications back in twenty Thirteen\n\nAnd in April twenty Seventeen bringing and Women's Hospital agreed to pay ten million dollars to the federal government does Duterte accusations that doctor and versus submitted fraudulent data to get research funding\nI'm like\n\nOfficials at Harvard denied declined to comment on why it took so long I'm that's what I'm sitting and wondering [noise]\n\nDr ... who's a cardiac researcher he rocketed the fame they report in two thousand and one with a flashy paper claiming that contrary to science scientific consensus heart muscle could be regenerated I mean he ...\nHe had a a theory or a hypothesis that run against the the the grain\nNow\nIf it would have been true that that research had an enormous implications\nAnd\nUh these other labs and other scientists have been trying to replicate his findings using his procedures and they can't do it what they're stupid and heat there's right\nPlease stop it\n[noise]\nAnd this was wrong\nBecause it gives\nPeople false hope and\nYou're you're telling people that you can regenerate their heart muscle after they've had a major coronary the art muscles been damaged and you're injecting themselves in there that that will do anything you might as well\n[noise] I bought it makes me speechless us\nWhat are they doing running this trial [noise]\nThey should they shouldn't be running this trial they should shut it down and they started the trial after they knew this [noise]\nI'm Talking about the government [noise]\nThe national heart lung and blood Institute what are they doing\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] greed greed this is a ... that's about and companies still selling that that therapy those themselves for damaged parts to people\n[noise] shame on them\nThere's a number to call eight seven seven eight

top destinations Costa Rica India Israel Malaysia Mexico's Singapore South Korea\nTaiwan Thailand turkey and people even coming here to the United states [noise]\n\nWhy these particular places according to this website they say that the making of a world class healthcare destination is complex [laughter] we consider a variety of factors including government and private sector and they go down this long list\n[noise] [noise] what are the top specially for medical travelers\nRight at the top of the list cosmetic surgery dentistry cardiovascular people going to other countries get angioplasty and and uh what transplants orthopedics joins spine a sports medicine cancer\nOr a reproductive issues fertility [noise] a weight loss lap\nLap band in ... and gastric surgery\nScans test in health screenings and second options I can see why people would come to this country to have that done which makes me scratching my head\nIs why would people leave this country to go get those kinds of procedures done somewhere else and for cosmetics it's about the money you can go to Mexico and get a facelift probably for half the price [noise]\nAnd so where your face looked like it

then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... flew it\nThey actually inject this ended joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so\nIt's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule pat it's big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down\nSo that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but we prove that it's orally absorbed\nAnd more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as we think of it\nNow bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time\nAnd that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha\nThe body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of ourselves begins to lose its water it separates out and then we begin to lose the substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we didn't get into a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know positive daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nJell O a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nBecause it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue costs ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about ... gas it\nWell it took Thirteen Years for all the costs of me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time and it'll get there because patients are going to take this through the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patients\nNow do your Britain a great deal about the role of highland want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue how does each a work in the joints and the connective tissue is\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking about between the bones it also surrounds the nerves there's a sigh addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve all of these\nAre going to need a special cushioning that ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Bernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you it work miracles for him why\nBecause purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called Hydrox that's taken from olives now pat you notice you can put a bowl of olives on your table in a year later come back and except for a little\nBit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there they didn't shrivel up and waste away do the fungal contamination so there's something very strong and all as we've known it for a long time Dr Roberta Korea an Italian researchers now here in this country doing some research on hide\nRoxy tier is all extracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules to that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so we began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives\nInto ... new ha joined formula you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us this year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nThey just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a Dr Kelly saying\nHe looks like a man that's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe his level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula\nNow this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean and it's all safe all natural its purity age a joint formula and pat\nMost of the people who write to me or call me or not people who regularly fall for you might say radio commercials they don't buy stuff off the radio they just out of desperation knowing nothing housework\nThought that take a risk well
