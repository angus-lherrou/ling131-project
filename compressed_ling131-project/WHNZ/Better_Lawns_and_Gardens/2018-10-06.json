yourself how you feel I mean say to yourself do I think I'm On track I might pretty confident\nOr ask yourself is there room for improvement do I want to do better because to do better maybe you need to get the second opinion and have us look at things and made me give you our ideas that doesn't mean I'm going to be your financial advisor\nWhere you're on the show I Want to help you uh yes I like

something or we can help\nEverybody by giving you good advice and so you might be with your advisor for twenty thirty forty years I could be your brother your sister or your spouse\nThat doesn't mean that a second set of eyes can't make a difference in your wife I'm going to give you some good advice we started the show talking about how technology\nIs going to change the world I Hope for the better although could be some bad stuff too in there but why not take advantage of that and make a little money because these things are here they're coming and they're great investments when you do it properly\nWe also talked about today Todd the retirement check I had gone out to MacDill air force base I had the pleasure to talk to a military people serving in the military maybe they're getting out over the next year or two of the majority of them\nAnd I spoke about how to build your plan how to know if you're on track are you doing OK and that was a you know and that motivated this radio show I Want all the view every one of our listeners to be able to go to sleep at night saying I'm doing great I'm right on track\nOr if you're not on track at least having the comfort of knowing what you need to do to get on track and I'm going to help you set those benchmarks right so that that you can get on track\nAnd and that's what the shows about the shows about helping people was what the books about the books about sharing information that will help you\nAnd and the money goes to charities I'm helping others too I Love that piece too but I really want to help people with good knowledge the best thing is when we get to sit together 'cause I Love meeting people are the best part of my job is that when I'm with people\nAnd I can sit with you understand what you're trying to accomplish where you're trying to go we can kind of do that retirement gut check together and so I'll ask you questions I'm a good listener I write things down and I'll take notes\nAnd then I'm going to go back and build your financial point I'm going to custom craft a plan for you [laughter]\nEveryone's has different I sat cookie cutter is your plan and in it's going to be how much money was my

bonding I'm going to help you get your taxes down and that's what I'm going to do I'm going to show you what you're paying for your best was one of these we always talked about a ... you want to say

advisors a family member and\nOh my God whoa whoa whoa wait it went up ... member was posing them on\nMy with my industry does he get what's your what you say to\nI say that I find if we do Sherry obviously is you know find another relative Shia [laughter] Todd within ...\nInvestments costs money but you want to keep your expenses as low as possible but in in this industry not everyone's transparent you were produced shares will do share a transparency you know everything that's unique semi for that's not how other advisors are\nSo I see this stuff all the time and so when you come in for the meeting work at a sit down we're going to review your finances I'm going to get your copy of my book\nI'm going to give you my ideas on how you can do better\nAnd maybe we'll call that our

I don't buy into sitting is the new smoking I don't I haven't bought into that\nYeah agreed I don't think it's quite that extreme but it may be the unhealthy habit that you know some non smokers have\nYeah board it takes a lot of work and a lot of fun to stay healthy doesn't it [laughter] a lot of movement and a lot of movement or are you a home that I moved into a new place\nNew place new

moved to a new home to either hung out there you go yeah\nStressful oh ... you go into therapy [laughter]\nKnow I mean it's it's wonderful to you know the fresh start and and all that but why is it stressful [noise]\nYeah it it it is so much I mean then you're then you get conflicted do I keep this or do I throw it away\nDr Kate welcome back um\nSo I thought you would appreciate those quotes uh I Know you disagree with that as well the science does not support that view or as much as they would like the reader or the listener to believe\nYou have any comment I\nKnow that that's absolutely right it's how these studies are reported are often so twisted against multi vitamins\nUm you know and and the largest I mean you really are sure views are are tricky to begin with even though they are they carry a lot of weight you know meta analysis it sounds very technical and yet they're still is an absolutely um\nYou know a process of picking and choosing cherry picking your studies and so you can include or not include whatever studies you want to come up with whatever conclusion the one [noise]\nUm and then there are newer studies where they do long term trials\nAnd the one of the best ones with you know as you're aware of the physicians health study where they followed roughly Fifteen thousand\nPhysicians are male physicians starting from the age of fifty and half of whom to a placebo and and a half from didn't and one of the biggest uh ... uh you know results are findings that were published out of this study is that among this group but generally heart\nHealthy individuals that multi vitamins did not lower the risk of heart attack amongst the people who are healthy and so the headlines that came out where\nMulti vitamins don't help you voting monuments are useless which is so misleading because in fact when you look at the study even just around heart health among the individuals who had cardiovascular health in fact taking a multi vitamin did seem to reduce the incidence of heart attacks\nWell similarly were seemed to reduce the incidence of cancer [noise]\nUm and these things are just not reported in that way those don't make the headlines\nIn my view I Do not think and I have never set on air I have never written I have never given a talk I have never alluded to the idea that taking supplements will cure anything\nFirst of all generally neither do pharmaceuticals ... secondly\nTo assert for someone to say a a multi vitamin will prevent cancer or cure cancer that person would be very suspect in my mind I read about their credibility or that it's going to prevent a heart attack\nNot true\nSupplements cannot out paste out run the weight of the variants associated with diet and lifestyle Dr Kate\nI'm you and I both know that um and that's what the supplements Warren intended to do that and that's that's where these doctors like a and I'll say his name is Dr David ... is on CBS I've seen him on CBS and and just\nRifle through a a a heavy criticism of dietary supplements\nAnd I'm sitting there thinking Dr ... and he's smart he and he knows better and he says things are just not true the sciences there we can I can take 'em in the ... met or any database and show thousands of studies and so could you do it gets frustrating doesn't it\nIt really does it and it's because it's the message that gets out is not serving people it's not serving the public good\nAnd it is shaking people's confidence in Hempel inexpensive and kept that they can take back the odds in their favor just that can be a healthy lifestyle just part of

and said that so why would you say something about taking\nThey have really yeah what do you think all those commercials are well that's commercials I mean like a dog what what are they telling people to do well the yeah I don't say it's on the healthy food but it is unhealthy food everybody knows it's unhealthy food [laughter] it's it's a lie in broad daylight\nThey do tell you to eat those foods those foods are unhealthy they processed foods high and salt sugar and fat Dr ... you know there's a compromise\nOf the various up some of these chronic diseases or contribute to them don't they\nOh yes so in the sense Gary they do they do and the ...\nI mean they're not saying this road is unhealthy we solid do buy it they don't say that right but you get let's go to let's go to Clarksville

just wanted to clear the deck of that we're not going to we're not making these ridiculous claims and we're not saying it cures cancer that will raise Lazarus from the dead or make you walk on water
