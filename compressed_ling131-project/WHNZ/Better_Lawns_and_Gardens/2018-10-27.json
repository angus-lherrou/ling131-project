Campbell and we are sponsored by the find folks that purity products\nOne of my favorite gas is on the line we've got Chris kill him also noticed the medicine hunter Sandy by now CNN polls Chris the Indiana Jones of natural medicine because he's constantly scouring the globe searching for natural remedies\nYou may have seen Chris from the doctor on a show or maybe on PBS or CBS and also on Fox News where he does a health segment he's been featured in New York Times and\nAlso on ABC's twenty twenty anti Christ is joining us today to discuss not one but three of the hottest nutritional ingredients out there on the market today even better he's teamed up with purity today\nTo give away a complementary bottle to everyone out there in the listening audience so do not I repeat do not changed that dial\nFirst a quick introduction curriculum is an author and an educator he's written fourteen books he's conducted research over thirty countries again he's been on with Oprah and friends and Dr oz Chris welcome back to the show\nThank you so much pat it's always a pleasure to have a great conversation with you\nNow most of us are super busy these days we want to stay healthy but quite frankly it could be drawn to you know with all the different supplements out there not Chris you've traveled all over the world learning about different natural remedies so you really know which ingredients to look for so tell me this besides a good multi vitamin it's official maybe a few other things\nGo into the streets super hot nutrients you've been so jazzed about lately\nWell pat the three super nutrients as we like to say are a green tea extract a tumor Rick extract called Kirk human\nAnd an extract from red wine called ... they're a troll and apropos of what you said about my traveling around the world I've extensively\nInvestigated they use in their host countries so I've been in the green tea plantations of China and India and worked with top researchers of this ingredient in those countries\nWith tumor Rick I've been deeply involved with Tim Rick researchers in India and seeing all of that and with raspberry trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California and she'll lay in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that green tea Kirk human from to recruit\nAnd risk Vera troll from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from in the very very substantial way\nNow Chris let's talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're all found in our diet and all are considered super foods the green tea ... there were spiritual why did you want to combine this re there's always a method to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect they make each other work better you caught a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason to put them all in separate product they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kind of like\nYou can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and\nThat's a little bit simplistic the fact is that all of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both antioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough\nI also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resveratrol in one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nNow let's dive into the headlines and the research especially on this green tea because it's absolutely amazing I Know in Asia and they've been using it for thousands of years for healthy aging but what are you seeing recently in the press I Know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July twenty twelve issue revealed the green tea sickness\nSecondly increase plasma anti oxygen activity in whole blood unify on you recap some of these headlines and tell me why you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume ... don't actually wind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed\nThey improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells of your body your organs every part of your body\nFrom premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to fire on when we take in the right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants\nOur bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called\nGlue the thigh bone so you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to thigh on so\nIt is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant foods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nAll right let's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea combo formula would be offering free bought on a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human which is spelled C. U. R. G. U. M. I. N. now most people haven't heard of it but scientists and researchers know was one of the most\nPowerful super feeds on the planet you can positively influence our D. N. A. maintain joint comfort healthy inflammation in more can you share some of the incredible headlines on human and tell us why you use this patented B. C. M. Ninety five formula of\nKirk human which seven times greater absorption\nOkay well first of all I think people might not know that term Kirk human they may well no ... which is a yellow spice and it shows up in curies and it's part of the five thousand year old Indian ... system of medicine", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Better Lawns and Gardens", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
