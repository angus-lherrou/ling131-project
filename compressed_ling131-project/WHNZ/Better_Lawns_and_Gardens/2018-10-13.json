important to the show if you're just joining us or you've been with us the whole time I talked about a couple of things you know I talked about your retirement plan at work how important it is to use that\nAnd so make sure you're utilize properly if you want to come and sit with me I'll be glad to show you how to do this\nBut take full advantage of that plan that's really really important and sometimes you're advisors are going to tell you not to do that they're they're crazy you need to use these plans if you're not happy with you that's been suicide\nThere's some Dakota in service distribution that allows you to open up your choices so just make sure using plan right we also talked about health care writers\nA healthcare writer as a really valuable tool that I Hope no one needs but if you're concerned about the possibility of home health care or nursing home or any of that stuff\nAh it keeps you up at night this is a tool you want to look at a just cause I'll help you with this stuff but we'll we'll put it together\nAnd uh I'll show you how to use these things um the thing I Want to talk about right now that's really important as this market has been on a tear I mean it is really high\nAnd the mark has been going up and up and up and you know there's a saying Todd that rising ties for all boats have you heard that before of course you know so everyone was doing well now some people believe all I was like the visor wasn't doing a good job but today's doing a good job I'll sit tight but the reality is the market's going out the market's going up everyone's doing well\nYou know there's also a saying that floating or boats are uh are rising because of tides but also there's another uh addition to that that uh you know a high tides are they they thought the boats but also a that vote will also be money pit as well so yeah yeah so if you're on a boat or be prepared\nTo just dump all kinds of what you're gonna blow your ... you know what I said\nSo so what I'm saying is everyone you you feel grade because this is a good market and things have been going well and I hope everyone is doing great in it but be careful there's a lot of musical chairs right and that music is going to stop one day and we don't know when this party is going to be over so when I'm sitting with people that question I'm getting a lot is\nHow long it what what do you think's going to happen this year how much longer is this going to go on\nAnd and I got to tell you something uh I'm pretty optimistic I'm always very optimistic and I believe if you invest properly do things the right way you don't have to worry about this stuff\nBut this party will and one day and we have to remember what happened to us back in two thousand a dry and that was really really bad to protect yourself so it doesn't happen again you know be careful you know it's kind of like Todd ... you know the difference between a tornado and our hurricane\nAbout folks here here we go this this is now the weather's segment the those when I let let me\nLet me tell you real quick you know a tornado comes upon us very quickly it's unexpected you don't know that it's coming but but look here in Florida we know they're hurricanes they find a way out in the Gulf of Mexico and they try to predict where they're going to land\nAnd a tornado's unexpected butter hurricane is somewhat predictable right we know what's coming we can prepare for 'em and everything\nAnd so it's really important to understand the difference so with your finances the market's been great everything's good\nBut a crash will come and the correction will come at the party when one day and we can start preparing for early so just like you know boarding up your windows and putting a little water aside or whatever that is that you would do in a hurricane or why don't you start protecting some of those gauge in your portfolio\nSo we don't lose them as well I mean it's been a long time since the last corrections is two thousand eight\nOr it's probably overdue\nAnd typically we had these ten and twelve percent pulled back every year we haven't had one of those for a while\nAnd and prices are high and I'm not saying that the market is going to stay on a tear I'm very optimistic about all the things going on and frankly are you know we're investing for clients were not hiding from this but you know what we're also doing or being realistic about it and and we're saying look\nMaybe it's time to start thinking about protecting some of your games and not losing everything finally your for one case of come back and grown and your accounts are on track and everything's good\nWhat's wrong with thinking about this might end one day and that may not end well so I Want to be protected with my finances and a lot of your stockbrokers are are I guess in a car you say pedal to the metal let's go go go go well\nLook we're getting good returns to but we're doing it while managing risk\nDon't take all the rescue work too hard for your money and so I think it's a great time to get your financial house in order and what I Want to offer to our listeners if you haven't called and yet you've probably been a listener
