I was out of it just go have a good time always having a good time with the\nDiverted to head over to Facebook Like as ... radio and of course at any time twenty four seven you got a question for the coach called the coach outline eight seven seven nine zero for trade that they'd seven seven nine zero for trade ... one of the neatest things about the financial markets is a lot of people look at the ... financial markets as a secondary plays\nTo either part money or put money and they hope for the best and the true professionals trade as a business the true professionals utilize the market for the opportunity whatever the opportunity is as give it to him let's take a moment\nWe'll talk about what does it look like for someone to trade as a\nBusiness well let me take a traditional business say a small business but it's some of the challenges that people have to start those businesses a lot of times is initial capital outlay\nYou gotta Lisa building you got to rent a facility or read the equipment to houses that facility you got liability insurance you might have employees and staff and payroll and workers' comp and\nYou know inventory there's a lot of there's a lot of things that go into starting a traditional business and a lot of people follow that path because it's the dream I mean you know the American dream land of opportunity go build something right your own tickets have equity work so hard to own something\nAnd they love the opportunity and see a lot of people struggle with a lot of people driving down the road right now you're a small business owner\nYou own your business in your business owns you and I know I've been that guy had been that person who was a small business owner and I was a builder\nI was a framer I did a lot of construction projects and you know what I was always chasing money and chasing clients and trying to get people to sign off on punch list like get paid\nAnd so I understand that headache when that traditional process of building a business\nThen you look at the financial markets trading and investing you can start a business on a shoestring you literally getting into the arena with a couple of grand maybe even less than that if you treat and currency is I mean hundreds of dollars I mean it doesn't have to be a big pile of money you have the ability to sell and by\nInstantly so if you understand what a good price to buy isn't a good price the cell is how to buy a wholesale style retail gives you a tremendous it man she'd have to leave your house you have\nCustomers that you'd never have to meet that have been willing to buy for me right now or study right now you'd never have to leave your home enough to pay liability insurance you don't have to hire people know worker's comp no staff I mean think about that\nAnd have the same upside ability to create wealth\nThink about that that's the dream and see when I get introduced the financial markets as a traitor investor I had no knowledge of the markets I just met a guy was successfully trading I\nSaw his lifestyle it appealed to me I saw that he was no smarter than I was I saw that he had no more skill than I did he just had more experience and learning what to do\nAnd I got excited and was able to start to venture on this field and many people that's their entry into the arena is it they look at it as a way to start a business without a ton of capital and have the American dream still be able to exist without a lot of traditional headaches at most business sense and once you start to understand the real opportunity\nAnd the real power of understanding how to take the money consistently in the financial markets\nMan it can really go to the next level and I've seen it happen a lot of people's lives for middle is is that could happen to you just a matter of taken the step of moving forward and learn the skill starting the business\nWell neat thing is is a lot of people want to own businesses out there are a lot of people will be asked him privately\nIf you had the opportunity to quit your job would you and the answer tends to be yes more often than not\nAnd a lot of people just don't realize what it really takes to get started up in this arena to start a business now ... we're talking about you know there's many business you could start you start a restaurant you get a key asking the ball you could do something you could there's so many different businesses get started when it comes to trade investing a lot of people don't know what it looks like\nAnd the great thing is is that it's the same upset up or to the same potential without a lot of traditional headaches that's a real game changer for a lot of people that have that business savvy in that entrepreneurial spirit\nAbsolutely an online trading academy they have a class on trading as a business every time we give this class away rumbles and bears the phones light up we'll have a few seats to give away

takes it the and the jets or an extra point away from time again\nSo they go oh I mean let me let me count the times that I've been a part of the broadcast like this the answer is many really it's just that none of them are in the national guard\nLike when I was in college and I did a high school football games that kind of stuff happened to all the time all the time I've never happened to the jets the oh I\nHave had some explosive plays crow welder Seventy seven yard TD run\nRobbie ... and had a Seventy six yard TD reception and then moments ago you mentioned the thirty five year grab from Sam Darnell so they had nothing but Aaron things out against Denver they're up Twenty one to ten near the end of the first half speaking of explosive plays in Kansas City in Jacksonville, Florida\n\nHe's still in his phone booth oh is it a man that kind of hard yeah it's very exciting but it is in a ...\nFoot is twenty to nothing yeah Kansas City at the end of the first tap me well in Carolina\n[noise] they throw it back\nOver under oath Beck and juniors quarterback rating was fifty seven [laughter]\nOver the over under\nAnd don't forget a people asked him about manning being the the the kind of culprit of of a bad off it's for the New York giants and this might be more animal and his back pocket so she ... them to stay one Berkeley\nCaroline still leading do right now at the half it's twenty to Thirteen brown six to three over Baltimore Miami a road Don winning instant same fourteen and that thing the lowly bills on top of the Tennessee Titans seven to six guys\nPlead elapsed sucks yeah well he may Packers are brutal yeah you know you don't need a rubber there why not as leader labs a Packers just fell down twenty four now [laughter]\nUm I Believe that's Marvin Jones in fact in the end zone and is unreal caught a bullet for Matthew Stafford and uh that Aaron Rodgers bubble has turned into the Jones habit gosh she did what are you how much bad\nThat is absolutely ridiculous that is not athletically possible leap pick up your head and watch the watch that I Do watch it I'm like you watch it again\nIt is twenty three to nothing about I Want you to pay close attention to this partly I Know it was you Franco here called ... and I want you to watch this late watch this now they're going to snap hold they kick\nAnd then the ball goes through the upper out on a parade or I tell you that that's it all that and so it goes in between the up that's the old adage twenty four to nothing\nThe lions are crushing the Packers you broke gas cans huh you broke his heart saying what do you what you know what's broken the NFC North\nYeah going on right now is rope broke\nIt is broke the Chicago Bears at three in one\nOr the lions are only going to go to two and three assuming does hold 'em but you know what's upside down his right side up\nThe the Vikings not only are ones doing one but there in Philly right now and the Green Bay Packers again if this holds fall to two two and one and everything is all just completely jumbled up and John ... first round draft pick is now fallen to about twenty fifth in the league\nWell well I Will say this last ah or should win they'll win last week it was weak one against the bears Aaron Rodgers second have knee injury pulled off a seven point comeback yeah so is hope last what twenty four points\nRight now kind of okay yeah okay fair enough [laughter] yeah yeah there is a there's a difference between Seventeen and twenty four boys yeah yeah there's a difference a touchdown yeah and and the difference between limbo field and Ford Field\nNo there there's a lot I'm pushing yeah and the way I'm not going to call it a possible\nI'm not going to call it impossible because twenty four points actually is not just the three score game they could get your point conversions Everytime too\nNow you're talking down said turn that front I don't have a very inks are looking I'm a very optimistic\nGuy we're barely even checked in on the buffalo Tennessee game for very good reason mainly because buffalo is playing Tennessee\nIn that game right that is a yes yes however so defensive battle\nLittle pitcher now going on in Buffalo it is\nA football game and the bill's lead the titans seven to sick um if you combine the two quarterbacks they've thrown for a hundred yards now where he turned out that\nA Josh Allen six of ten forty a yard he does have a touchdown run Mario to seven uh fourteen sixty four yards and does have a pick as well so both of these off fences which are challenged\nThey are challenged offenses I'm playing a challenging game Seventy six bills Lee the titans but somehow you know what the most under disgusting is in the entire NFL this year what's up the titans are three in one\nNo I Know and they just pulled up ah three in one a tremendous victory over the Superbowl champs last year against the eagles last weekend\nAnd ... look ... that took godsend it took some intestinal fortitude and\nI tip my hat to Mario to for keeping the wheels on this thing I I Do blame him for a lot of the struggles that this team has had I think they felt handcuffed to them in some ways um but I I'll give him the excuse he's out a lot of different head coaches during his time\nAs the titans quarterback so maybe this time it's for real you have a defensive coach there who's gonna largely stay out of the way let dolphins do its thing and it it it appears that he has belief in what he's doing he's won them a bunch of games in a closed on last week an overtime against the champs\nA short time ago we had the giants strict play coal against the Panthers were touched down that was ... W F a out of the giants radio network also were live\nAnd the Geico Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance would Geico guy could not comical eight or nine four seven out of the only hard parts figuring out which way is easier so do you have a fantasy team\nThis is about the time a day I think that you should open up the shop and check the score for the first times a lot of time lapse a but we're going to help you if you are stuck out at a kid's birthday party or you're in the backyard doing honeydew\nLet's check in on your fantasy team the ticker is next I'll read Jon radio\n[laughter]\nThat'll be the thing goes off\nWe'll have a job from the city on our\nGo home is the right here in this case Fox Sports radio\nHey it's been matter here everybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk\nHere's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy code dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nBeen the rhyme like fake framing court grow here severe breaking free by how much sooner than five that's down ... no second touchdown cats or the year is a forty three are bullets from Matt Ryan\nThere it is that one on your point on the game falcons radio network the Steelers lead this game Thirteen to can bomb it's a new to catch is fifty seven ... James ... says come with me if you want to live\nFrom inches away the Steelers and the I guess\n[laughter]\nGyms Connor it is looking fantastic\nFor the Steelers didn't lay beyond bells that that was from one one o two by Ben Stiller's radio networks look here's the deal about James counter Seventy six on the ground one dog rushing but he's also got to target to to receptions eats the dual threat there were hoping to find in the running back room\nSuper bond about that because of going against James countering fantasy today however it's all good 'cause I got older the beat\nThey throw it back\nDown in San Diego they have a casino called sick won but in New York it's a running back he's got three judges were sixty six yards of his store Nineteen yards on the ground as well oh D. V. for catches fifty three yards one pass one completion\nFifty seven yards at a store and the giants have their quarterback of the future\nI don't know if you heard about as the crow wells new endorsement but he is or wiping up around girls right now\nI just ran Seventy seven yard touchdown jobs that we were in commercial saying\nDon't laying down the left side of the field he takes [laughter] and [noise] and the chapter an extra point away from time again\nVery discouraged jets radio network play by play their butt girl well on that Raj gain Seventy plus yards of his one twelve on the day with the dodge\nDart it they do the ball darn thing and recreate it like I had to beg him to get a\nLot ... downright sideline it going on ... devoted started dread it didn't touch down jet laid down that didn't do it missed an opportunity but that's okay I bet she's radio networks been having a blast in rainy Kansas City down\nKnow I Love the way the Kansas City broad jobs through say the words lake board all it makes them very excited both\nGoals do just keeps interception\nBut gives Don Giovanni and that changed that depends on the board today with their big sex and may lead twenty to not being over\nThe ... yeah I mean if you're going to tell me Jacksonville being the top defense in the lead going into this match\nUp that would actually be the cheese with a former recovery porous score two interceptions into Saxon this game so far in Jacksonville boiling way behind them statistically I would've said a no no no but uh but that is the case\nBut one out a couple other names often Hooper the falcons signed that a judge in Seventy two yards um so I keep an eye on him I Know he's a bailout\nBoy and a lot of lead a tight and it's just a ... position next year\nOr so check it out all the new Kenya Drake or the Gulf War carries Twenty one yards to jot just when he died yard add a touchdown athlete Garrett why watch this one by Jerry fix your ... ... yeah that's right well well\nWell where's the blood clot back ... three judges Ninety three yards juice they're just they're three ... thirty one yards at a store or the Steelers\nAll right it is I'm a ... a

quarter and I have to go\nYeah and oddly like you mentioned back maybe given up into little juice they have two hundred twenty yards passing which might be their most to this point in a game at any point this season so far\nUh out out a out or I should say ... from the yard standpoint out doing the Panthers by nearly a hundred yards at this point in total up and so so yeah look at the giants it has been a story\nThat has gone oh wow look a high round draft pick it running back really dynamic player\nA old veteran quarterback who can get it done one of them a couple of Super Bowl a revamped hop into one and not fences falling flat with pot trimmer at the helm who had success deep into the playoffs last year with the Vikings\nAnd so I think there were a high expectations in low outputs so far this season\nMaybe some more of this creativity is what's going to Boone there six such as the season rolls on everybody's still getting used to that op and again judgments made in the first four weeks of the season not usually smart judgments let's wait until we see the end of October before we can tell you what the giants actually look\nLike OK Stafford is alliance come up short on third in Eighteen they get just twelve so its fourth in six or are they going to try a field goal or are they gonna punted away to the Packers and let them get the ball back or the right about the thirty seven yard lines so\nUh that is a place kicker this warming up there ... on the the later is on the field so they got themselves close enough to at least give it a shot but this is a long one\nThis is going to be what about fifty five yards yeah this is a fifty five yard attempt perpetrator of the alliance it is on its way it is nowhere near good that they took a right turn about halfway there so now the Packers get the ball and the Packers are going to get really good field position\nMeanwhile in Pittsburgh James Caan or just takes a whole emperors scores so this game is starting to get out of hand for the falcons\nMy fantasies are saying\nYeah yeah well listen James counter is one of these guys who I think a lot of people picked up in the later rounds and fantasy football on and it was a smart choice because Les beyond bell dug it deals in the ground on these contract negotiations and in the interim number thirty for Pittsburgh is looking maybe like the running back of the future\nUh yeah that they should definitely make the case for because even if maybe on comes back doesn't doesn't look like he's going to be to still running back next year let's keep an eye on the ravens here real quick as they are facing it in a crucial third down here trailing nine to three and the ravens are going to have about a third down and to\nFrom the browns six yard line so they're knocking on the

the potential because there's been some is paid to use today but the bangles had there's up and good for Seventeen Seventeen seven forty to play\nIn the fourth quarter Panthers on top of the giants twenty six that ball game is also on Fox Cam Newton on the day eleven I'm Nineteen hundred and twenty yards passing in one CD Pittsburg by ten over Atlanta twenty seven to Seventeen\nJets twenty four Broncos just ten New York on the date twenty nine Russia's for two hundred and forty four yards\nOn the ground as they grow up in the Seventy seven you're scamper to the house and that's why New York is on top by fourteen guys back to you\nAll right Dave thanks yeah the jets have been all about the big ways today they've got twenty four points on the board or Sam Donaldson only completed nine passes okay he's nine of Twenty one for a hundred and Seventy eight two touchdowns are picked Robin enters into big ways as\nThey grow wealth has absolutely stuff the box score a hundred eighty yards on the ground at a touchdown run it also has a cat for twelve yards jets are up by two scores a bunch of ah of note right now few things first of all the Steelers just got another score\nA better off less burger on this one\nFinds five times ah let's\nSee who did he fired oh yeah it's around again Antonio Brown with a second score the game isn't it interesting brown and back um people wonder why wide receivers or sets divas\nThere was why it works squeaky wheel\nBack um big game Antonio Brown big game both of them after squawking this week about they're often well\nHere's the deal and I mean and to me this is one of the things that I'm taking away from social media now watching a a college team even experience some of these things as a color analyst\nAt the college level everybody wants to have a voice now and everybody's aware that the more of a voice you have on social media\nAre the more famous you become an with fame come inherent privileges or you get treated differently than everybody else you get endorsement deals you get huge shoot deals and so into neo brown and oh they'll back in the junior I have no idea if this is manufactured if they're letting their quarterback in on the joke\nBut they are becoming super famous at they're given position for making a lot of noise outside of what they're doing on the field we've seen this work at the quarterback position\nAnd have wild success stories like Richard Sherman attacking Crabtree\nAnd Josh Norman attacking del back in the junior and all of a sudden there were launched into super stardom and they are in these giant contracts and everybody wonders why it's because they're box office it's because not only they counted on the field but they also get people to buy their jerseys\nAnd ownership of teams understand that that's a significant play killing Ramsey ... the same state right now for the Jacksonville Jaguars\nLike a book I mean he's absolutely following the thing to it the GQ article ask me questions about another player all rip them for you\nAsk I mean that's the game that he's playing a people taking his face value you probably shouldn't um but you're a you're a hundred percent right All right Tennessee Titans Ryan sucked up fifty yards through the upright good that's clutch for forty three to go and not game the titans have just taken the lead for the first time\nI owe Dale back from where the giants touchdown has been a huge day for him and know the even Eli Manning seems convinced that this penalty is on Carolina this is from thirty three yards out manning hits owed outback them beautiful post route in between two defenders nice thrown nice catch\nAnd oh db as yet and the giants or go for two and all of a sudden they looked at in the water and now they're one way from cutting this the three with eight minutes to go in the game\nSpeaking of which divide the Adams low red zone for the Packers Aaron Rodgers adds another passing touched down to his sum total today\nAnother one a little while yet to show my minutes to go to this guy\nIs incredible so yeah well the prater convert to make this the three score game again the the Packers just won't go away\nFrom asking us to point conversion is good for the giants as well so now it's twenty seven twenty four ain't no way to go in that game ... well for the Packers based in Crosby can you make an extra point no you can't he's completely ... out that his old for for\nFor me today to haul though this one was simply an extra point now they're still technically down by a touchdown in a field goal because I think it's rather obvious at this moment they're going for to the rest of the way no matter what the hell of a situation is 'cause why not\nBased in Crosby is one of those guys that you wouldn't think he's been around so long you are but I I mean\n... you know if a kicker this earlier in his career he's got\nNo ... and and later in his career you may give him another game but I'm ... I'm not saying he's ruined but this is this is a really bad showing that he can't seem to get them out of this whole\nWow All right so a lot just happened delayed us but we're we're going to get to it right now benefits X.\nBox sports fantasy ticket [noise]\nAll right we're going to start in a game that we thought was going to be wonderful for fantasy players and it was high old Bradley extra quicksand\n\nYeah dealers radio network advantage the owners are asking where did you come from as well there you are the judges one hundred yards to touch down for a\nB Aaron Rodgers is in Detroit and like a mold he just won't go away\nPower I formation Rogers hunters center\nAnd joins Rogers\nOne yard touchdown pass last Kendrick\nYeah so that was earlier touchdown Kendrick tag on another one that the bond they Adam ... place low red zone twenty five or forty ... won the poor yards through the air Aaron Rodgers leading comeback central into their kicker tend not convert\nHowever dirty wanted twenties bill nine minutes to go Detroit lead that one All right let's go to New York we told you earlier as of this moment damn Donald has only completed ten day there was one of them\nOn one of the center for the clock at five\nThirty five but Denver facts looks outfield looks like\n\n[noise]\nWell along with the Broncos chances the women's game the announcers boys all gone but ah the Donald's Robbie enters the connection has been very good today\nJust lead that name Bernie boarded Dan Robin ... hundred twenty three yards do scores thanks so much jets radio network\nWell the bell is sold in Pittsburgh but it's not the bell you're thinking oh here\nYeah that's the dinner bell you're hearing James Turner is eaten up right now Steelers radio network there he's on the ground for two touchdowns over a hundred yards they're also for targets in the air he's caught all four of 'em for Seventy five yard\nStrange that the jags dope way as well or don't have as many wins all ... up by these are planted\nAt first fourteen your line [noise]\nYear old and right corner the end zone he didn't make the get down\nInto the TJ yelled and for the score\nAlright though the ... um they're going to lose today but you might win if you started DJ yelled and jazz radio network right there you all been done Russia's Burke fifty three yards five catches for forty six yards and that score right there are\nA little Kim jung McCaffrey that's starting to become a bang down and for new has\nGiven them a cat for\nHave we have\nThe Panthers radio network and that's absolutely true that just sold touched on on the game can strong for two Fifteen to twenty four hundred sixty eight yards through the air giants don't pick them off white this game so he's lower on the list but he's got a pretty nice outside ...\nOkay a couple of other names to point out on the way out my guy O.

game is over\nCrosby on the sideline\nBeside himself because nobody else has near him\nAll right now we got to shift our attention to Carolina where the giants with just over two minutes to go trail thirty to twenty four but how the ball so here comes the two minute drill\nThey've got a second into coming up at their own thirty three yard line they hit the two minute warning so here comes the second into he like many much maligned this year the offensive line\nThe same but they've had a decent day today they've certainly done a good job of getting or Dell back I'm involved with the first time\nHe's got it catches a hundred and thirty one yards a score and he also through a trick play to sake one Barclay first score Barclay as forty eight yards on the ground sixty six through the air and a touchdown catch that went for fifty seven yards so I don't love the giants chances year but the guy that shot\nI'll tell you so much diaper jobs back first intent after the turnover rundown Smith kick in Detroit and what happens first read all of the box he get sacked lost a yard and there'll be sucking in long and\nGreen Bay calls a timeout so bizarrely there is still life left in the game in zero it right now well railing by the\nTime when they're robbers came I feel like they're playing five quarters like their sit on this thing going on with the clock like do you notice these other ... they're all over the\n... the bills titans game ended thirty eight minutes ago yeah hey here's the Packers ally and I think you're back in Tennessee already browser and over the head out the Packers the lines are like\nYeah we're about halfway through the fourth quarter what what's going on\nAll but anyways Stafford complete the golden said on the third in the lab and that's going to convert and that you have to feel like is probably going to be close to the last breath for the Packers they've got one time out they've got the two minute warning but remember they would need to scores and by the way one of those scores wouldn't need to be a field goal\nWell yes and and also remember Detroit\nThere in striking distance with their own kicker has been fairly automatic prater today so I I you know crossing over the fifty yard line huge sucking down converging there by Stafford in and take it on the hook up I mean the the the blitz the pressure that Green Bay broad I mean they were dropping them off the roof\nStafford hung in the pocket delivered the ball and it was a strike to take it so it looks like that'll be a ... for Detroit\nYeah last time out has been taken three Thirteen on the board the lions are going to go and run the ball mode and air Rogers visibly frustrated on the sidelines okay\nDon't they just happened in\nLos Angeles this is breaking that hasn't happened all season long do we do this now [laughter] box Caleb Sturges\nJust hit a forty nine yard field\nGoal putting the charges are arguing over the red\nAnd what I like to call home away game\nBecause I don't know if you've seen the stance folks but ... has been overtaken by the silver and black\nAll right so ah the ah the rivalry is on in a south county of Los Angeles where they played viva Las Vegas says the raiders took the field\nThe entire stadium is filled with black the chargers hit a field goal from forty nine yards drew case or the quarter is sitting at home and go on what the hell's going on because the kicker can't make it kicking they cut him\nInstead of the kicker they blamed holder and the early returns are that was right and how about this the giants have just flip the field\nAnd gone down the other end and with a minute twenty nine to go they've got the ball now deep\nInto Carolina territory wait a minute is that a time\nOut thoroughly Sheppard sought out bell went down the path their defenders never touch them on now have about Mike Adams is denying that and so we're going to get a review here every screwing players reviewed Mike lowly kitchen let's check this out our Stirling going down to the ground ... down does Adams touch him\nHe reaches fine he got um I think ya got him back conclusive I think so you got a ride everybody calm\nDown on his shepherd I wasn't even completely one hundred percent of wary of the time they definitely got he got 'em down by ... conclusion\n[laughter] you know it's the part where suffered is totally on the ground and Adams has his forehead audience rib cage gosh you receivers who gets up is like no one touch me except for the time that he totally touched you yeah hold on to the you know on on\nThe back of shepherd Jersey\nAll right so let's pass this along first off the browns out the ball a as you know first it over time did not convert so they kick it away now to the ravens\nThe giants will have the ball as opposed to that touched down you could ask the question why did shepherd fall down I mean you I hit him stride for stride and he was behind the defense\nWhich is why the Panthers letting someone get behind the defense in this position but anyway it's going to be at the fifty yard line that's where the giants will now have a first down and the clock suddenly now does not become an issue minute twenty nine what I'm thinking about is the clock complaining that you've done a lot over the last few weeks\nThis is one of those situations where you have to sort of think about not scoring too fast ride right has the Panthers can fly down the other end and get a feel go\nWell it's it's absolutely correct I got to score ... ... you got to score so when you get it you get it\nBut but there is a big but here in the bud is when you travel like you do and you have a a opportunity to gain a one point edge you have to consider the clock low red zone this comes down to the fate you have in your office to convert when you absolutely need to\nAll right so we're going to have the exciting conclusion of giants Panthers raiders out the ball first ravens and Brown in overtime red zone radio Fox Sports radio staying with us [noise]\nHis Fox Sports radio [laughter]\nAnd this is where you get your and found\nFrom the morning I'm going to run through all of my stories in the NFL

so here come the Seahawks onto the field and the chargers and raiders are at the home of the raiders or even though it's not the home of the raiders will keep you up to date on all of this let's get David gas got in here as well update to fall scoreboard\nMao didn't die seven seven\nCheck this out we were watching well and one of the studios I was watching the browns or ravens game with you guys yes and direct TV turn that game off\nWhat it'll do look for channel seven oh five to seven or seven so if everyone's watching this at home and listen to show whatever turned seven o seven right out there it is what the hell I'm mad as\nYeah three Eighteen to go in the overtime area and and I now Baltimore how's the ball back still tied nine nine\nOh Flaco through a ...\nOr is almost answered but they're not the ... so the browns would you time outs remaining an extra session or need the football back ball game is tied nine nine now I'm going to have to do this because Mason Crosby had a brutal day at the office and this'll be a a special tribute to him\nThree hours away\nI'm going to win the game six seconds left [noise] you know his law\n\n\nPanthers come from behind the beat the giants thirty three thirty one and also more for Mason Crosby\nHolding down how she's got plenty of\nFunny\nHow many there [laughter] God God it's so basic Crosby in the day one of five on Google trial Mississippi the\nLift all those points on the board in Green Bay ended up losing the game at Detroit thirty one twenty three Aaron Rodgers four hundred and forty two yards passing\nThree ... also lost a couple of bungled the Monti Adams nine grabs for one forty and also a TV but again they they lost the ball game or the loose bite jaguars they fall in Kansas City thrown into fourteen Pittsburgh club to Atlanta forty one Seventeen\nBen Roethlisberger and brought to spread a pretty good game those James Caan or a hundred eighty five twenty yards and ... and Tony brown six grams per one oh one\nAny score a couple of scores a Denver loses in New York the jets thirty four sixty nights aircrew well did teen carries for two hundred and Nineteen yard in this contest also had a one ... one of them for Seventy seven yards out\nAs a team the jets a dirty Russia's for three hundred and twenty three yards kind of gives you like in the past for like a shot penny in the aspects yes these that that was it was wild a couple of the afternoon games as you mentioned charges lead the raiders\nThree nothing Vikings and eagles on Fox there's no score same thing in the Pacific northwest Seahawks and ramps just underway and in Santa Clara the cardinals and forty niners that game is also school this guy's a\nI'm going to go look for new kicker yeah joins Crosby or even to join the ink and tell us right now on the way we're wired browns\nUp just sign Mason Crosby was I'm leaving for two tomorrow I did very well I've got five sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more cars were guy go God could are calmer eight or nine four seven out only heard part figuring out which way is easier Baker may feel just took off running\nUm and now a third in age from their own Eighteen is coming up and do that the two minute warning raiders in forty niners both knocking on the door and the red zone a Marshall Lynch will take it to the five\nFor the forty niners I Believe it's a touchdown is that breed ... it is Matt ... for an opening Dr touchdown for the forty niners they'll lead the cardinals the raiders trailing three to nothing or knock it on the door the law to second in gold coming up\nBut it's the quarter break so that'll be the first way of the second quarter the rams up block the plot for the second time already this year act by the way it did that at home against the chargers as well same player\nCorey little tune who's the San Diego kid comes screaming up the middle and both of these I don't know if anybody studying special teams film and then I felt but the Seahawks allowed the same exact way to beat them on the block pond so rams are knocking on the door and the red zone and this game in Seattle\nRight there was a mat breeders shoveled paths from CJ bathroom such that the extra point is no good mainly 'cause they they never checked it\nSo watch this to get a well let's see if they'll replay they snapped it and I don't know the whole just wasn't in the right spot but Robby gold walked up to the ball and then just didn't kick it\nAnd so on no extra point they're forty niners lead six nothing me John Brown's third down huge play I'm Antonio male or female finds cow away and that one is going to move the ball down field and Mrs Mayfield on a total improvisation\nHe finds no that's not Calloway actually oh who's this now ah yeah this is their fourth receiver\nWho's going to flip the field and take it to the other end I'm I'm going to get a name for you number eighty four that's de ... of\nCourse yeah of course the ... which sounds like a joke name that you give your buddy in high school yes a de ... is taking the ball to the Baltimore forty three\nFirst down a bunch of course the Cleveland kicking game is going to need more and there's a minute sixteen left is all on the clock and I hate we said every week I hate this clock thing in overtime or because we are getting ... perilously close to get another tie well\nAnd that would be the second time the season for the Cleveland Browns or the Bronx I mean that would be absolute insanity after seeing back to back ties in the NFL for the first time\nA in is since the Nineteen seventies uh we could potentially see the first team with two ties in lord knows how long and so the browns\nIs it ever it is ever go\nIts ... Greg Joseph food today is made from thirty five minutes from fifty five but also miss an extra point\nClaimed that off the upright so you know the browser gonna want to get as close as possible they're going to get ahead off here and that's a I don't think that's hard I think that's a new jobs and do Johnson's going to take about ten yards off the right side\nAnd that will definitely help and get it down inside the thirty five yard line still along field goal still a very long field goal but this is going to go down to well actually he's inside the thirty to the twenty eight so it'll be about a forty five yard or from right here\nNo no it it you're you're well within range of ... field goal for an NFL kicker you'd assume but we've seen a lot of crazy things this season in the kicking game already\nA field goals let alone extra points and here we go do Johnson junior still in the game and rumbled for another six yards off the right side of this line the browns right now imposing their will run in this game Oakland by the way in LA right now knocking on the door second and\nGo back in the Gulf from the five now there is a flag down so this'll probably moved back a little bit let's keep our eyes on the browns only twelve seconds to go in this game second and father run it again and again do jobs will take it to the Nineteen they're going to run this clock down time out\nAnd bring the kicking unit out onto the field for what should\nBe about us thirty eight thirty nine yard or and this one skills you because that's close enough to wearing NFL kicker is expected to make it and if he doesn't I have a feeling the browns might be a cutting their second kick her again this year\nThis is incredible it's just incredible well let's also incredible is how many overtime games they play it in through this this short season so far four out of five weeks a and do Johnson receiving do credit on the sideline as he leaves the field and Joseph Greg Joseph new kicker in Cleveland ah lines up\nOr what will be probably the most important kick in his very young a rookie career here thirty seven yard at times\nThird and one\nIt'll be the final play this game\nFrom the White House Joe says for the browns the kick is blocked blocked what it was\nBut I'm not\nSaying that this happened this is Matt rounds defeat the ravens twelve denied All right so a trajectory on make contact\nWith one of the Baltimore Ravens hands on its way to the upright and finds its way through for a twelve nine final in Cleveland wow\nWow so often wobbles through and it goes right over the cross bar am I right then it got tipped yes or no you're absolutely right up until they did right it looks like", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Handel", "city": "Tampa", "day": "07"}
