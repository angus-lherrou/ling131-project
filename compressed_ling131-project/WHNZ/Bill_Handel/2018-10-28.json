coach called the coach hotline eight seven seven nine zero for trade that they'd seven seven nine zero for trade ... one of the neatest things about the financial markets there's a lot of people look at this financial markets as a secondary place\nTo either part money or put money and they hope for the best and the true professionals trade as a business the true professionals utilize the market for the opportunity whatever the opportunity is as give it to him let's take a moment\nLet's talk about what does it look like for someone to trade as a\nBusiness well let me take a traditional business say a small business but some of the challenges that people have to start those businesses a lot of times as a missile capital outlay\nLisa building you got to rent a facility or rent equipment to house that facility you got liability insurance you might have employees and staff and payroll and workers' comp and\nYou know inventory there's a lot of there's a lot of things that go into starting a traditional business and a lot of people follow that path because it's the dream I mean you know the American dream land of opportunity go build something about your own tickets have equity work so hard to own something\nAnd they love the opportunity and see a lot of people struggle is a lotta people driving down the road right now you're a small business owner\nYou own your business and your business owns you and I know I've been that guy had been that person who was a small business owner I was a builder\nI was a framer I did a lot of construction projects and you know what I was always chasing money and chasing clients and trying to get people to sign off on punch list like get paid and so I understand that headache when that traditional process of building a business\nThen you look at the financial markets trading in investing you can start a business on a shoestring you can literally can enter the arena with a couple of grant maybe even less than that if you're treating currency is I mean hundreds of dollars I mean it doesn't have to be a big pile of money you have the ability to sell and by\nInstantly so if you understand what a good price to buy isn't a good price to sell is how to buy a wholesale subtle retail gives you a tremendous advantage you'd have to leave your house you have\nCustomers that you never have to meet that are willing to buy for me right now or study right now you'd never have to leave your home enough to pay liability insurance you don't have to hire people know worker's comp no staff I mean think about that and have the same upside ability to create wealth\nThink about that that's the dream\nAnd see what I could introduce the financial markets as a traitor investor I had no knowledge of the markets I just met a guy was successfully trading I saw his lifestyle it appealed to me I saw that he was no smarter than I was I saw that he had no more skill than I did he just had more experience and learning what to do\nAnd I got excited and was able to start to venture on this field and many people that's their entry into the arena is it they look at it as a way to start a business without a ton of capital and have the American dream still be able to exist without a lot of traditional headaches at most business have and once you start to understand the real opportunity\nAnd the real power of understanding how to take the money consistently in the financial markets\nMan it can really go to the next level and I've seen it happen a lot of people's lives and for middle is as it could happen to you just a matter of taking the step of moving forward and learn the skill and start in the business\nWell neat thing is is a lot of people want to own businesses out there a lot of people if you ask them privately\nIf you had the opportunity to quit your job would you and the answer tends to be yes more often than not\nAnd a lot of people just don't realize what it really takes to get started up in this arena to start a business there ... we're talking about you know there's many business you can start you start a restaurant you get a key asking the ball you could do something you could there's so many different business get started when it comes to trade investing a lot of people don't know what it looks like\nAnd the great thing is is that it's the same upset up to the same potential

there'll be dot com says there's going to be a new general manager announced this week for the New York Mets they're hiring an agent to be their GM\nBrody bandwagon and whose clients include Jacob ... un assessment as Tim TiVo and others obviously it'll have to sever ties with CIA but in the NBA who's the Lakers GM Kobe Bryant agent ... who runs the warriors Bob Myers was an agent so the Mets are going to make news this week\nAbsolutely and you're going to see a lot more of this there's even a little bit of this with what the forty niners have done I Know John Lynch wasn't an agent but Richard I've talked a lot about this it seems like a time or mines are opening a little bit to people who are in and around the game but just not necessarily\nIn that role like my resume doesn't have that role but my resume knows about that role cause I deal with those guys all the time I mean think about lead Jenkins Sports Illustrated for how long I enjoyed\nI write every single feature PC road and he goes from being a writer to a front office type with the clippers and Jerry West brings them on board and he has this long absurd titles that they created forum\nAnd it'll be interesting how he effects change in that organization or what he's asked to do\nThese are outside the box decisions that have been made I mean you look at Sean McVeigh he got that job when he was thirty one years old and he is now being taught is one of the great minds in the sport of football I think there's been a paradigm shift\nI think everybody's looking at things differently than they ever have a across all sports and it's very interesting time\nI think you use is a weapon in the minds of people who are hiring you look at even someone like Aaron Boone taking over managerial job with the Yankees I don't necessarily know or at least trust team to team what a manager even really does anymore other than keep the clubhouse together which is a big part of the job\nBut I even you know I Know Dave Roberts uh he uh probably didn't look but he a tough night on social media last night and I just threw out there simply breathe and ask yourself are you sure\nHe's the one making all these decisions you don't like are you sure and very few people waited back and said Oh yes I Am sure rent we don't know we don't know so use is not only um\nMaybe bringing new ideas but uses also maybe controllable\nMultiple malleable ally of the people who are hiring people\nI mean I Know how I was ten years ago I was I was a lot more bending that I Am now it's just it's at that age brings a bit more sturdy opinion selfishness uh and and maybe some inability to change where's use\nAll those things are available and and another rookie manager having success ... Cora ... he's been managing his tail off for the Boston Red Sox and here he is on the door steps of winning a World Series in his first year doing the job\nThat's unbelievable to think about two guys managing back and forth at one another in the world series and you're like I just saw those guys play each other in the world series [laughter] I felt like only about six or seven years ago I might have been a little bit more but\nAnyway All right it's red zone radio Fox Sports radio and were alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance with guy to go to guy could outcome or call eight hundred nine four seven out of the only heard part figuring out\nWhich way is easier let's go to that bears jets game which has reached the half at seven to three yeah two games in fact right now in the NFL that are out to have with seven to three scores Washington in front of the giants by that score as well\nAnd it's almost jarring and twenty Eighteen I Know as you said we're starting to smell Thanksgiving when the weather just a little bit suffer scores will go down so no not in every fantasy league is not going to be over a hundred points every day for the rest of our lives so we're gonna have to deal with that\nBut at the same time it's almost jarring to see this the way the jets seven to three there are a total of a lot of been completed passes him this game ... you'll see games like this very much anymore\nWell no but you do as as we approach late October early November into those months where we are nearing the holiday season because the weather starts to take a turn\nAnd whether factors mightily in these games game plan and when you have high when when you have rain when you have snow when it's cold it just changes the way you shape a game plan so offensively this is the time\nOf the ... this is when you really have to rely on some of the old tenets of football let's play great defense let's have a reliable run game yet I'm all blocked up on up front when half our games on the road when the majority of our games at home and let's go play some playoff football\nThere's only one game that is still in action right now everything else is at half time but the bangles mainly because they've been scoring so much for taking their sweet time and getting their half time of the buccaneers are trying to make this a game before our time it's twenty seven is sick\nCincinnati all over Tampa Bay but with seven ten seconds to go to Evan Bayh is threatening and currently has a fourth and goal at the seven and they just said three tries to get in didn't do it would you kick a field goal down\nBy a twenty points a Twenty one points right now or\nWould you take a shot on force and go with the seven yard\nLine I mean it always goes based off two things one I'm quite frankly when you're down that much you have to you have to consider absolutely going for it but to it's to feel you feel like you're a fence is going to convert because even three points on the other side of this half\nThe Tampa Bay gets the ball back so that can tumble into ten points I think that I think that honestly you kick the field goal since you've got the ball back in the beginning of the habit\nExactly what they did so it's all good and it's twenty seven to nine or Cincinnati leads Tampa Bay and James Wednesday and who we been talking a lot about what had to have\nThirteen of twenty four for two hundred seven yards that was that one touchdown throw but two interceptions and I was interested to hear about the Sean Jackson who has the Tampa Bay touched down today or sixty yard strike\nAre asking for a trade that according to Jay Glazer earlier\nYou almost wonder and won't have this on any of forty but I certainly wonder\nDoes this have anything to do with Winston Jackson was the leading receiver in the NFL for about two and a half weeks when Ryan Fitzpatrick was in there and Tampa Bay was winning football games\nAnd then James Winston came in Jackson's getting a lot fewer catches Tampa Bay is getting a lot fewer wins I'm just trying to put puzzle pieces together here\nI'm an answer in a single word absolutely I mean just think about this when a receiver complains dial back in the junior who's the complaint about ... Kelvin Benjamin when he was with the Panthers who is he can't complain about Cam Newton\nYes yes he's complaining about him is Winston and so he wants out because he he doesn't have as much time as some of these other young receivers in the league\nHe needs to strike well his irons pretty hot and it is following that great out first he had with Ryan Fitzpatrick if he can get himself on ... on you know a team that has a chance this season maybe he cannot return to glory\nAll right we're starting the second half the giants are on her way down seven three with the ball the bears are up seven three and they've got the ball will start to take a look at that and get you the fantasy ticker version one coming up next on red zone radio Fox Sports radio\nThere is a real [laughter]\nThey're making them play\nAnd we're breaking it all\n\nAre dealers radio network in the yards are a little muted but that's okay Brin Tony ... fifty nine yards and two dogs on the day is that about twenty three fantasy point\nTo the running back room back to the mix in mixing it in\nFirst and goal from the yard line for the bangles Dalton handed off to mix and whether\nHe will walk to the end zone I ain't touched out for a job back then twenty nothing's Cincinnati\nVarious again it's the bangles radio network and yeah may already over a year on the day piling on the ... the well do you have a one or two you know on the ground twenty six overall point\nAll right we keep hearing that the pack twelve is down well maybe not because it's got to play there anymore\nFor singles luge effects McCaffrey\nThe free time heaven down on you and [noise] my\nYeah they're doing all the better the theme today if you started gruesome or job Rica's jak this from the Panthers radio network routes McCaffrey has got a total of twenty seven yards that some of the whole the fantasy though because for Kerry's were sixteen yards three catches ... and a touchdown on each side Seventeen points out in\nThe Christian averaging or yards of Jerry that's easy math for all the rich ... yeah if you want to do well in bed fantasy football just remember two words died bears ... much things over\nJets or bring an extra\nRadio network going and going in on the screen pat nice little touch Best Buy you're busy you Seventy yard or for going and he's been dynamic data that bears back you know\nDoubt about it All right to update the board some other names\nBut when they're DJ more for the Panthers five catches Ninety yards also has a couple of Russia's or that have gone for thirty nine yards sick one Barclay doing his thing although he has been such pay dirt yet\nEleven Sherry thirty seven yards six sketches or sixty four yards CJ yelled and did some nice things in limited touches this morning\nIn

two yards through the air and two touchdowns or sixteen fantasy points couple of such down throws for Cam Newton as well as your guy drives Kelsey for catches fifty three yards at a trip to the

out of a I have a by week uh Keenan out okay I'll Try a Robbie ... who's also out okay and so I had one other choice the receiver other than those who are already playing and so uh I just had to pick the guy who look bad health\nThe guy All right so you didn't actually have to start out and Robin since you started Keenan Alan and you could have started Robin are said I could have all good choice no not any are good choices that All right sorry about that stuff up break not so good okay\nGreat new as quickly as you say if somebody is what's the guy who got a guy could I comment and Fifteen

I let him do it\nMaybe sneak it I let him do it I also want to a direct our attention to Kansas City where Emanuel standards just met a cat and on the run afterward\nI landed in and just reacted very strangely as he held his right leg up in the air while the late on his back\nFor a period of time and is now limping off of the field and Grimm missing in some pain for sure so Emanuel Sanders leaving the field for Denver who is that the Kansas City thirty yard line right now we're the first in Ted trailing thirty to fourteen\nYeah you know they they can't afford to lose too many weapons but all the while throughout the season the consistency has been filled Lindsey everybody thought that case keen them coming off the season he had would be somewhat of an answer but yeah let's write their attention back to the bears going forward on fourth one and\nThey they are here ... you're on the rollout and he is going to I think the first down fat looks good boy he stuck his body in there and throw the ball out there along the sideline and I think he's got enough to move the stakes so to be first in ten for the bears out about the jets Twenty one yard line\nWho play here so it's a running plate the left side left tackle\nPulls out in front meeting the convoy Jordan Howard in the backfield what's your ... he runs bumps up this looks like a Kim new design because he's so big and he's so fast\nThat you can trust them as long as the years the football surrounded himself and so Jordan Howard is the ad blockers there so that everyone blocked up and he was a little tempted to make contact you out on the sideline there but he converted to first down in Chicago\nAll right so the bears on the rate option while here to Jordan Howard he'll lose a yard and that gives us an opportunity to talk about Jordan Howard who I'm sure\nThan a year where there is a lot of fantasy frustration in certain facts that I'd been leading that way with the lady on bell who hasn't even played\nI'll bet at the same time Jordan Howard just an odd year because the bears are good and he's there and he's healthy they're just not quite using in the same way but even when they are they the dynamic flare of Jordan Howard for whatever reason is just gone\nIt it's slowed down and you know some employers react to dream we well when they're sharing the football with other players I mean we see this in

[laughter] should I even say when this game I I don't see that being the case\nBut should he get them back close in this game and he is as a result sounding we'd better game then Jim is Winston could at the Winston name come the trade that mine\nWow wow\nI hadn't thought of that one and there are teams out there I mean but are you going to flip your team over to a new quarterback mid year I Know people I was thinking about the New York giants ... well how about the Jacksonville Jaguars but I mean are you really going to make that kind of a switch mid year\nWhat about the ... the thing about the Buffalo Bills I mean they do have John sound but as a stopgap for a year maybe you pick up Seamus I mean we've seen this before we seen this before I think you would have\nTo have some gap space to sign a model is we are sure sure because he's got a you've got a pretty hefty salary either\nResigned at the end of the year or so you could take a look\nA what's a update a couple of things first of all Baker may feel just throw a pick but he was down before he threw it second of all the bears are moving into the red zone right now and in fact\nAll the way deep down to the five yard line bears are God Jordan Howard so again this shows power knows no bounds if you want your fantasy player to do well simply have us talk about how he's not doing well\nHe's going to have a big play there's now right up the metal five yard line first goal for the ...\nWhat's funny is the place selection to were saying yeah they struggle getting them going right up the middle of the traditional way what did they run across the whole back traditional counter play yeah to tackle pull across off its formation seal a block on the defensive manner outside linebacker to the right to join our right up the middle\nAnd their egos again and now we're back to normal to yard yeah through the three ... second goal\nComing up for the bears so there are Seventeen to ten seven and a half to go knock it on the door a little bit to see if they can try to put this game away a touchdown feels like it's definitely put away a field goal feels like it's probably put away\nBears need to come away with something here is their second and go play with ... out of the shotgun read option up the mental touchdown Jordan our yeah that's now joined our oil you go\nIf I were in it might be doing this de Kelly feed me you know just spoon and the men just like a a a fresh bowl of cereal hey this is a we took care of that this is yeah we certainly that this is exactly what you need to do I I always said in football especially at the running back position\nYou feed the hot hand when you have a running back by committee situation like quite frankly the bears do because Cohen has emerged as a very competent rush or\nA you just have to go with whoever is having the most action out of the backfield and so on this Dr\nReally smart to keep him in the game get his confidence up and he converts for six and they tag on the point after touchdown going for ten\n... ten Sam Donaldson as we said earlier with a heck of an assignment and now a it's a huge one seven or eight to go in that game bears lead the jets twenty\nFour to ten injury time out in Kansas City we're trying to find out who that is it's on defense\nShe's trying to hang on leading Thirteen to twenty over the Broncos eight and a half to go in the game Broncos have the ball\nMeantime piss magic has Tampa Bay or with the ball in Cincinnati territory the strange thing here is this game's not over no I don't know if they're going to go for a field goal you're going forward it's fourth and three at the Cincinnati twenty they're down by Fifteen thirty four Nineteen ... ton of time on the clock\nThirteen minutes left to go when you leave it to fits magic to come in and try to steal a game here\nWell how many times have we seen fitzpatrick early season connect with Athens or Jackson down feel huge chunk plays\nI mean the majority of his touchdown passes to start the season we're on like sixty yard bombs so I Would not first second doubt the opportunity for them to have a comeback it just really comes down to the the offensive mash\nOf the Tampa Bay buccaneers and and quite frankly the defense of adjustment by the Cincinnati Bengals anytime you have a new quarterback in the game we saw this with Baker may feel getting the winner of the jets early in the season when to Raj Taylor was taken out do the injury and he entered and became the the brown starting quarterback\nAnd Ryan Fitzpatrick through this season has been more consistent a performer\nAnd quite frankly I don't know if you buy this but I certainly do a better leader it just feels different\nWith them to prove that yes yes and I don't know what the deal is why every long pass he throws this year gets caught for a touchdown\nI I don't know what that is I guess it is a I guess it's magic\n[laughter]\nI expose people to magic\nAll all say that this is what I Want to get it right now we managed\nTo keep in mind this game of keep in mind how Ryan Fitzpatrick handles they pose came news conference [noise] yeah\nAnd if he wins this cat march and if he comes out as Conor McGregor are jokes either be number one sport Halloween costume this week\nWill be no the other than writing fitzpatrick I think people are going to buy beer at an unprecedented rate over the next forty eight hours some guys might even try to grow them oh yeah I'm chains a lot of just there a lot of beer and a lot of magic on Wednesday night\nLike ... I I I picture people showing up dress like Conor McGregor and everybody says where are you McGregor and that all of a sudden they break out like a job out of their pocket and we're like oh no I get at your fits that stood\nWell no this is going to be the classic because you know the dichotomy between men and women on Halloween yeah men usually either don't want to dress up at all\nOr they're going to maybe do something in the sports or like action round yeah women of course like to maybe just get a little suggestive with whatever the heck they want to do and so Ryan Fitzpatrick will be the costume that every dude gets\nAnd no women get there'll be like\nWho is that yeah no it it ride fix Padres then they'll be like who is that is he getting Brittany spears [laughter] no I don't know but it could be ice ... does\nHe like many throws in the end zone for Barclay incomplete knocked up in the air third down that was it so now I think we go to force and go do you kick the field goal to get within a touchdown or maybe that was second goal I got to wait and see what was that certain goal was out for a single\nA bark no yeah kicker is cut out ordered and ... they're going to kick a field goal and the New York's fans just love it look at it oh yeah there is one that when you sell it for three and New York\nNow I'll tell ya I Would go for this happen because this is just in my personality it takes it's hard to get down there maybe I I Know and then that's the part of this that is lost ... lost confidence in Europe and I'd rather lose the game within the five yard line four minutes earlier than the end of the game\nThen can see three points when you could have had\nSaid okay but I'm going to take a page out of conversation we had earlier in the week with regard to the New York giants going for two on Monday Night in a traditional strange spot\nAnd now we're told all analytics say when you're down fourteen and he scored a touchdown you should go for two that's what the map says ... out of the news conferences that that's what the math set\nMy response that was well that's the mouth of all football games you can't tell me it's an equal scenario when you're sending you I mean are you going to pour off ants onto the field to go get that to where other teams might be sharing sending Rogers you Tom Brady on the field to go get to that is not equal so you don't get to use that analytic\nWell look what they do from the three yard line in a situation where they need a touchdown now patch drummers got no confidence all of a sudden to get those three\nAre and also this a Roach trust because patch Irma was brought in as an offensive brilliant mind out of Minnesota and the magical year that they have rights so when when you're out you know first and goal thirty second goal Thirteen Gulf War thing goal whatever it may be but you're right down there you're getting ready to score\nAnd you can't and you're an off into minded coach what ... what is what are you saying the team well I just I don't I don't have the way I don't have the play we can run you can't execute the play we need when we absolutely have to have it so you're you're ruining the faith that you have in the players and then the players likewise I bless facing you as a play\nCalled her final hour coming up and guess who's got the ball again everybody\n[noise] eight minutes to go to the game is now they\nGo anywhere and most people demand [noise]\nDiabetes high blood pressure anxiety med everyone's on them if you're a fifty year old male maybe a bit porky and you may even have type two diabetes a million dollars of term insurance may only cost you about two hundred bucks a month call term providers speak with big little with eight hundred five six eight twenty seven Ninety big Lew will find\nA term life policy for you even if you have type two diabetes are overweight or I have high blood pressure term providers helped thousands of people like you think they\nAt a four term life insurance to buy a million dollars of affordable term life\nFor you all you need to do is call big Lu at eight hundred five six eight twenty seven Ninety Lew will make sure the scales are taped in your favor call eight hundred five six eight twenty seven Ninety ... we'll answer your call and work to fit you went to a term life policy that you can afford remember big lose like whew\nHe's on meds to call eight hundred five six eight twenty seven Ninety eight hundred and five six eight twenty seven Ninety\nHelpful\nBought our first ...

other end of the field plenty of time on the clock they will give him a first out so it is a first in town right now\nAt the Cincinnati twenty five don't get one playoff it appears before the two minute warning here it is fitzpatrick well throw complete out to the flat bats Godwin who's going to go out of bounds inside the twentieth the Nineteen second down in for coming up anybody have any questions about how this is going to ask [laughter] oh\nI Love it [laughter] minute of this I look I I don't know how to describe it but every time he gets into the game he appears to bring a different the paradigm shifts it's just a different look it looks faster looks CRISPR\nIt looks driven and and Jim is Winston for all that that he was earlier in his career it's faded some recently and I I don't know I mean to my eyes if you tell me a thirty five year old should beat out quarterback in his fourth year who is taken with the first overall pick I'd say yeah probably not out\nUnless you've made up their mind the gym is Winston is not your future if he's not your future then go with the guy that's going to do better now than I Do know human needed here I've been nothing but impressed and I can't wait to see them story points to tie this thing where I\nLive in the guise of Fox Sports radio studios\nFifteen minutes could save your Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance guy go dot com for free re quote while they're at the two minute warning you're on the giants facing a thirty six from the Washington Fifteen are they still do have a miracle prayer I guess manning will flow and one hop this one\nOut to sterling Sheppard ah no need to kick a field goal here got to go for it down twenty to six only twenty nine seconds to go\nUp but in theory if the giants can get a touchdown here then go for the un sidekick they could throw a Hail Mary Broncos in the midst of throwing the ball over the field and there are a little cow lateral play that's not going to work its official and find all the chiefs to beat the Broncos\nThirteen to twenty three and the chiefs go to seven in one\nYeah she's stopping that screech to somewhat of a halt in the second half they started off real hot and then I don't know if they got conservative more trying to possess the ball but it slow down\nThe line manning on fourth and six world for all complete first down down to the to yard line\nAnd that one is they do have a time out there might be well served to use it here and they will about his Fowler that got the cat and down to the to yard line so now\nYou're at the two you've got Barkley but you can't really run the ball you got no time outs you probably need to keep the ball in the air this is the exact same scenario where they started going for the back to back manning sneak a Monday Night against the falcons which of course just took a ton of time off the clock so hopefully they learned their lesson\nAnd you start to question the decision making now because ah you know you look at that last for things goal and they kicked the field goal this can be ten points on the board right now for the giants down by ten instead of down by fourteen\nWhere you could win the game on a field goal a few ... converted to point conversion I didn't like the fact that they laid up for the feel go last drive\nThey will throw it will be a touchdown or to Evan anger from and so the giants do get to within one score\nAn opportunity Seventeen Seconds to go to go for non side kitchen see if they can how can other went up\nA young guy what a game again then again at home this is the best situation you can ask for as far as the end of game or they do have to convert bonsai cake if they're going to have a shot\nMeantime back to Cincinnati where Ryan Fitzpatrick on the second downplay or the pocket collapsed he was able to fall forward to not lose more than a yard but here comes the third in free\nFrom Cincinnati Eighteen yard line minute Seventeen and counting left to go to Patrick go take the shot gun snap and he will overthrow everybody nobody was open so he stops the clock but now he's facing a fourth and free gotta have it down by a deep and the Cincinnati is out\nYeah Cincinnati they showed blitz they only rushed or they played coverage behind it and so that was the only choice she could make aside from trying to run at himself which there weren't lanes they were containing him well so smart choice surviving for fourth down for three coming up ... game\nYeah this is Erin Ryan Fitzpatrick if you are truly magic you will get at least three yards right here right I mean from the Eighteen and now first the bangles will call a timeout so we will as well the conclusion of Tampa Bay in Cincinnati coming up next on red zone radio [laughter]\nUp and

part\nFiguring out which way is easier medicine taker and just a second\nBut I Want to spotlight something that's happened in the Packers rams game you've hurt me whine about it mostly off air all year as a guy who's got Aaron Jones on both of it's been okay that I brought up earlier today um when we were joined by Tom random in hey\nWhat are the Packers coach is saying about the run game because you got a bunch of talented guys\nThere seemingly not letting any of them get a flow and I know they don't trust Aaron Jones and the passing game but you've helped me understand for instance\nMelvin Gordon with the chargers I'm like why is he always so wide open for twelve catches a game\nAnd you've talked about how the coaches that sees him as a liability as a pass blocker\nBut they've been creative in how to go ahead and get the ball out of filled represents quickly and make that really worked in turn him into an office of weapons that have been thinking all year so why don't the Packers do that with Aaron Jones because this guy is clearly there most talented dynamic guy\nAnd he's gotten double digit carries one time this year and they won't start him well today you know what\nHe got the start he stayed in for all passing down all downs of the opening Dr\nRogers took us back in the end and they were not able they had to pump the ball away but you got three carries it already is twenty eight yards he took the ball for a minimum of eight or nine yards on all three carries I Wonder if it isn't airing Jones time for Green Bay\nIt probably is a if they're giving him the start it means that they have confidence in him from the standpoint of yeah you're our best back you're going to lead the way and we're going to roll with you as long as you remain as hot as you've been\nHe he runs violent you know time girl is on the opposite side of the field and this is a guy who was decisive downhill I could see all the same things about Jones he gets the snap and he closed his to that line of scrimmage really quickly he's on the defense fast\nAnd they're they're forced to make arm tacos because he's running by them if they don't attempt that we've got strong legs you often falls forward so he generates that positive yards per carry that you're looking for I really believe in him as a running back\nAnd our eyes up not deceived us he's been the best either backfield that she's\nNot a lot of the fantasy guys on sweater I've been starting a house tax free Aaron Jones and I'm Wondering if today are and Jones hasn't been freed so we'll see Iran's now with the ball\nAnd they're going to convert on a third in short for first down so they're approaching midfield keep you up to date on that game but right now get out your fantasy wind up saying let's take a look [laughter]\nFox Sports fantasy ticket [noise]\nAll right we're going to start in Carolina where the Panthers out of tall task today of defeating the Baltimore Ravens luckily they also have
