I was out of it just got a good time always having a good time with a\nOver their head over to Facebook Like as ... radio and of course at any time twenty four seven I got a question for the coach called the coach outline eight seven seven nine zero for trade that they've seven seven nine zero for trade she at one of the neatest things about the financial markets is a lot of people look at the financial markets as a secondary place\nTo either part money or put money and they hope for the best and the true professionals trade as a business the true professionals utilize the market for the opportunity whatever the opportunity is as give it to him let's take a moment\nLet's talk about what does it look like for someone to trade as a\nBusiness well let me take a traditional business say a small business but some of the challenges that people have to start those businesses a lot of times is initial capital outlay\nLisa building you got to rent a facility or rent a quip meant to houses that facility you got liability insurance you might have employees and staff and payroll and workers' comp and\nYou know inventory there's a lot of there's a lot of things that go into starting a traditional business and a lot of people follow that path because it's the dream I mean you know the American dream land of opportunity go build something right your own tickets have equity work so hard to own something\nAnd they love the opportunity and see a lot of people struggle with a lot of people driving down the road right now you're a small business owner\nYou own your business and your business owns you and I know I've been that guy I've been that person who was a small business owner I was a builder\nI was a framer I did a lot of construction projects and you know what I was always chasing money and chasing clients and trying to get people to sign off on punch list like get paid and so I understand that headache when that traditional process of building a business\nThen you look at the financial markets trading and investing you can sort of business on a shoestring you literally can enter the arena with a couple of grant maybe even less than that if you treat and currency is I mean hundreds of dollars I mean it doesn't have to be a big pile of money you have the ability to sell and by\nInstantly so if you understand what a good price to buy isn't a good price the cell is how to buy a wholesale subtle retail gives you a tremendous advances you have to leave your house you have\nCustomers that you'd never have to meet that have been willing to buy for me right now or ... right now uh you'd never have to leave your home enough to pay liability insurance you don't have to hire people know worker's comp no staff I mean think about that\nAnd have the same upside ability to create wealth\nThink about that that's the dream\nAnd see when I got introduced the financial markets as a traitor investor I had no knowledge of the markets I just met a guy was successfully trading I saw his lifestyle it appealed to me I saw that he was no smarter than I was I saw that he had no more skill than I did he just had more experience and learning what to do\nAnd I got excited and was able to start to venture out of this field and many people that's their entry into the arena is it they look at it as a way to start a business without a ton of capital and have the American dream still be able to exist without a lot of traditional headaches that most business have and once you start to understand a real opportunity\nAnd the real power of understanding how to take the money consistently in the financial markets\nMan it can really go to the next level and I've seen it happen a lot of people's lives and for me though is is it could happen to you just a matter of taking the step of moving forward and learning the skills starting a business\nWell neat thing is is a lot of people want to own businesses out there are a lot of people have asked him privately\nIf you had the opportunity to quit your job would you and the answer tends to be asked more often than not\nAnd a lot of people just don't realize what it really takes to get started up in this arena to start a business now ... we're talking about you know there's many business you can start you start a restaurant you get a key asking the ball you could do something you could there's so many different businesses get started when it comes to trade investing a lot of people\nAnd the great thing is is that it's the same upside opportune to St potential without a lot of traditional headaches it's a real game changer for a lot of people that have that business savvy in that entrepreneurial spirit\nAbsolutely an online training academy they have a class on trading as a business

first ... [noise] town\nI in the Philadelphia game and that is no good why going to feel though that came from the Panthers no good there's a lot of wind going on in Philadelphia today we're watching feel go kicks were subject Eliot already missed one\nThe ball was flying from one poll to the other right once they put it in the air so today's the day where you see any mistakes from go do or Eliot I'm going to give them a path because there's a lot going on in the air right there in that\nGame yeah and that was a forty nine yards and so that was a hope in a prayer shot anywhere\nBut and they never did it mean got to the Gulf ... like I mean that's how hard the windows law if\nYou're facing a headwind and you're going from that distance or if the winds swirling and it just happens to kick up in your face when you're about to take it there's nothing you can do no kicker can can face those conditions and convert but still that gives the eagles and opportunity to take over and they're pretty decent field position or or or no they'll pond\nActually yeah so the penalty was on a airline us aren't Carolina or a well no if the building was on Carolina what may have just declined it and taking the ball out there I'm betting the penalty was on\nA Philadelphia and in some sort of way after watching the ball fly through the air or yeah okay it was a false start All right and and so therefore it was quite do play but then Panthers probably are like you know what you're not going to make that\nMuch of that thing about that yeah I mean you can typically those or mental errors that you are absolutely crushing your team over but you're kicker misses the kick you out you go outside it's a it's a a play blown dead\nAnd you get an opportunity to punch now pin the eagles you know keeping their own territory is a great point they're out on it they're all five ... five nights all start to get a job or cocaine\nRisky back out on the field for the bears I also want to mention Cleveland really quick let's not forget so all of the positivity they've got a couple when yup bakers exciting all the games are caused Dakota overtime every week\nAnd then all of a sudden last week the chargers came into town and embarrassed them low amount of ... yeah yeah and now I'm looking at I'm In Tampa and they're getting pounded around pretty good again they've got two points on the board that's going to see other deep at\nOutside of that ... going up and down the field and Cleveland is not an keep in mind the tip of defense has let everybody moved the ball this year and the browns are not moving the ball and all all of a sudden I'm overwhelmed by this feeling that the browns are suddenly going to go back to look like the browser yeah\nWell and let's face it there was a lot of hype around Baker may feel coming out of the draft first overall pick he's wanting to as a starter okay or his completion percentage something that he was heralded for at Oklahoma has been fifty five percent on the season he's throwing more interceptions in touchdown\nBaker may feel has had a very lopsided year he had one really good game when you build them for ... Taylor and it was a comeback victory against the jets\nAnd then after that it it it kinda it kinda hit a slowdown look you've got no when as a starter under his belt so you get that off your back and you can start charging forward but I think as teams have been able to scheme the browns\nThey're finding ways to exploit his youth and so now the question starts to turn to was he forced into action too quickly is this going to be another spoiled quarterback out of Cleveland they draft high there's always hope springing attorneys around April for Cleveland the city up\nAnd could turn out the wrong way we don't know yet the stories yet to be told but so far he's he's look young yeah he's looked really young\nHe's exciting but ah it it it is starting to suddenly not look anywhere near as effective\nA third and three for James Winston bank down the right side line my Kevin in Cleveland territory meantime a third down for the browns are incomplete to Trey Burton so the patriots were down by ten in a flash or only down by three and Tom Brady is about to get the ball back so they can look at that\nComing up in a little bit it's week seven in the national football league on red zone radio but first diverge Allen sports report\n[noise] thanks guys this is the world champion handicapper Jeff ... from Las Vegas Sunday free slush in Dallas Washington in just a second how 'bout Jeff ... toll free message from Fifteen to run that eighty eight\nPercent winters I'm red hot huge information has been taken from Baltimore in New Orleans as a lock Casey Cincinnati\nTo parlay yours free on a recorded message call one eight hundred and eighty seven oh plenty to eighty three\nSports number one against the spread of proven New Orleans Baltimore is a lot plus for best specially going fine but no sign of big Sunday free on a recorded message call one eight hundred eighty seven oh twenty two eighty three [noise]\nDallas in Washington [noise] big NFC battle was off the blowout went over Jacksonville Scott had a huge came a hundred and\nEighty three hours passing she's\nEighty two yards on the ground cowboys had over two hundred yards rushing for Washington must he's win over Carolina ...

I'll wrap up by asking you guys a question I'm going to read a quote and you tell me is this from a press release announcing\nThe hiring by at tech\nCompany or a hiring by a baseball team quote\nTheir balance of connectivity communication and leadership skills as well as his understanding of a balding strategies and probably ... ballistic approached decision making led us to him is that a press release for a higher by a tech company or a baseball\nTeam please tell me that that's not what the angel set about Raul is actually\nWhat the ad about their manager why ...\nBaseball I understand entertainment or what how can you read that to me one more time if this doesn't entertain her parents often gets excited for next year I don't know what well let me hear it\nUltimately has balance of connectivity communication and leaders to get a leadership skills as well as his understanding of evolving strategies and probably about ballistic approach to this ... yeah I let us to empower little list that's\nWhat I Love to do on a friday night is probabilistic\nDecision making yeah that's my thing their their slogan for twenty Nineteen on my ... to be a good team that you and you wonder why nobody can recognize my shroud at the\nGrocery store this is a true story or ... angels were were sitting down for potential managers and giving them\nWritten to our ... yeah well that you know what life without probabilistic that was probably one of the [laughter]\nI I I I don't I don't it's like okay if that's what you want to do that's fine but now when you hear why they hired someone to understand why they were doing a two hour written test is because they're just completely ... out on this snow\nAnd I just totally nerdy out I don't blame them I mean think about the art of the red Sox think about the Dodgers the Astros I mean these are the the the last of the last teams who are standing misuse them they were built up through this analytics revolution here we are talking baseball and football Sunday but\nIt it has been woven into the fabric of the baseball community\nBut I asked then why do you actually need to pay big money to a manager at all\n... to get them to sign\n... is that it I think that ... what's going to happen is that there was an algorithm into print out and here's your wind up in the manager's just sitting there watching the game\nThey don't make a lot of money anymore ... everybody makes this something the managers are getting paid like the head coaches and NFL it isn't true some of these guys are only only look at it I mean it it's peanuts compared to ... you're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars salary per year as opposed to tens of ... or I should say ten million to the best coaches in NFL\n... they they are or not I shouldn't say underpaid they're probably paid what they're worth these days they're just managing personality and they're looking at print out\nKind of feel like there should be I don't know about Fifteen bucks an hour [laughter]\nI mean there's always going to do is needed now what does it cost to hire somebody to read to print out a well jeez I don't know\nI feel like they're overpaid alright Vikings lining up for a field goal Dan Bailey ball is all the way are no good there is a lot of wind on the east coast\nThat's what I figured out yeah there's a lot of wind on the east coast and Bailey misses a field goal Vikings continue to lead the jets by a score of tend to Savage week seven were alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance would Geico\nGo to guy could I recall and under nine four seven auto the hard part\nFiguring out which way is easier twenty six seconds to go in Chicago patriots and Tom Brady\nAll on the field with the ball up Twenty one Seventeen months also pass along the coast of Oregon is back in the game up all of those injuries with the patriots than right now all gosh what are they gonna know they're all coming back ... organs okay and I don't know if somebody shows okay but he is maybe not as bad as as a ...\nYeah yeah well we'll we'll find out if even re enters the game I'm sure it was the first round grade on him or I should say first round pick\nMy the patriots they're going to operate with caution here especially since they're leading here\nUh but boy Julian Edelman just absolutely up ended on a third downplay they were trying to get it out to him on a similar play they ran up the goal line without Ullman where they're run that bubble screens knocked out this done by the bears defense they make a great\nPoint yet but I don't want of course just pops right up walks back to the ah the ah\n[laughter] walks right back to the huddle you see Adelman and his presser yesterday Edelman is originally from the similar to Tom Brady is from the bay area yeah red light and and now\nThe Boston Red Sox will be taking on the bay area's rival Los Angeles Dodgers Edelman just fueled the fire for the world series immediately it just looks right into the camera and he goes I hate the Dodgers and there was a reporter kind of talking over him with a question this was funny and it was Savage\nHe's stopped after saying it she looked around he waited for everybody to stop\nAnd said it again yeah like did you all get the soundbite I hate the Dodgers\nYeah he had a giants fan I was drafted the same years Julian Edelman and boy can I just first second talk about a guy who\nYeah you see yourself who's Marlon not don't feel bad you have company but he is a running the ball over five yards a carry a loving cherish or sixty three\n[laughter]\nAs the return to the back he's healthy and he's just starting quarterback started running back with a goal\nAnd that score was off of one of his to receptions you've got thirty three yards through the air one touchdown a complement to the colds radio network\nLast year fantasy players got used to this idea when you guys are playing the jags Benjamin might need to change that\nThat got a call from the five watts it a loser has left rather Miller Miller takes it crossed off line touchdown Joe stand\nNothing like a color analyst just applauding him about it\nAbout one of the Texans radio network Lamar Mel Brooks five yard guarded Miller's having a nice day sixteen carries eighty two yards at a tug\nJeopardy used to be the name of a butler in Philadelphia you remember the fresh Brent oh just not a second\nAlthough I Will say that he's serving up touchdowns you got five perceptions on the day Seventy seven yards one hug and yeah I I think I'm I think who claimed to actually talk over this\nTrial [noise]\nMany cars than it was also in on that one two hundred and forty three yard\nTouchdown throw for cars but when you want to talk about cool you talk about the city of New York and that's where Adam Sandler is doing its thing to that\nHe'll go deeper than what\nHappens\nYeah here we go and yes we added the little horn there are there in New York but anyway no God that's when the Vikings radio network\nCake pan out of dealing with a touchdown catch and on the day five catches sixty three are getting a store you need just thirty seven more yard ... break a hundred yet again which he's done every single time has put a helmet on this\nYear yeah and I'm feeling is going absolutely bananas\nIt goes to show you when you are a talented receiver when you are paired with a guy who can deliver accurate balls all of a sudden your style guide rocket and that's why they'll back in the junior is making such a nuisance of himself in New York He's saying let me be like feeling\nAll right now the eagles are knocking on the door or the end zone and\nLooking at that game it's been good then as the numbers even though it's just a ten nothing game\nBack hurts ... who leads the NFL in cat years doing his thing again that catches one hundred for yard for sixteen points for fantasy points for his act urge today is the eagle lead this one cannot think given I carry on Johnson is well I have been singing his praises all year I Want them to treat him\nLike in every down back and they might be getting close to doing it alive and carry today for one hundred twenty yards do catch is Twenty one yard remember that whole deal the lions are gone like I don't know three and a half four years without a one hundred yard back carry on Johnson's got twice in the last three weeks\nYeah the lines are different theme this year a head coach map Patricia them playing more inspired football during the tough division though because remember the shock ... Chicago Bears all of a sudden look really good Aaron\nRodgers is still doing this thing they're on a by that and he's gonna get healthier so there there's competition obviously the Vikings we just mentioned with feeling um but but they're coming on Detroit's are making it turned around here\nA couple of other names dimension Julian Edelman five thirty six yards and a touchdown\nAlso the Andre Hopkins three catches fifty yards and a touchdown don't forget about you mentioned the biscuits he's only got Ninety two yards through the air but it got forty two Russian yard touchdown as well Tom Brady a hundred and thirty one yard city air to\nTouch down throws one day Adelman one to white so that's what we're looking out at vanity thicker number one will do that again next\nHour as weak seven starts to take shape we were saying a minute ago things looking a little bit sleepy so far maybe you know there's whether and when it's starting you were getting close to November So often the numbers maybe that'll be the finally a way to defend all fences in the NFL but right as we say that\nNow here we go the dolphins are on the board that made it a close game against the line that's what the dolphins do we'll update that situation again in just a moment week seven stick around\n[noise] hey sports fans are says world champion and it got a job down from Las Vegas Sunday update against the spread between five and six to eight percent winter some red hot\nCoffee on the Eastern Star to argue New Orleans salsa Lawrence ally LA San Fran\nDallas Washington part of a five and a five\nAnd six Sunday bailout toll free message one eight hundred eighty seven twenty two eighty three chef ... number one against the spread out for the\nNew Orleans ... is a lost soul she recorded message call now one eight hundred eight founded on twenty two eighty three to own a thousand today takes a lot plus the ... mall pall Asian cheeses passion\nToll free message one eight hundred eighty seven oh twenty two eighty three Baltimore and on just a lot of San Fran LA\nChallenged Washington bases Cincinnati five and a free five enough recall now\nOne eight hundred and eighty seven forty three\nVegas coverage that huh [noise]\nOh yeah\nBought our first I ... [noise] downloaded [noise]\n\nI Believe that castle just hit yelled in this crack for for a touchdown\nAverage hitter are yeah they know they after review they have been reviewing it out I think they called a not a touchdown on the field and now it's a touchdown TJ yelled and is it\nThat six ... six okay so yelled in from ... go figure but Jacksonville finds a second wind putting in their backup\nMeans I Am Sam Donald intercepted by the Vikings and they're going to return this one in the New York jets territory so that game it started to take shape took the Vikings a little bit there at the opening Dr touchdown and then they just could not get much going but now they take a temp point lead and immediately their defense puts the pressure on Sam Donald\nAnd watch the interception it probably should have been picked by one guy\n... glasses off his hands that goes to another guy and ah and then a nice return down the right side lie to the Vikings are in business up by ten looking for\nMore I mean Harrison Smith is a tremendous safety for the Vikings but he was just plain cover too\nSoft kind of backpedaling or because it looked like is corner had the route well covered and it was a tip jar he he he played back up near the sideline and it was able to get a great big return there because nobody else ran a sideline route so he had purchased all the way down the field\nAnd so they set up shop person down on the nine yard line going in the Vikings do\nYeah here we go so Kirk Cousins first and goal from the nine yard line is under center with Marie behind them Murray will get the ball and lose a couple of yards actually help fight to almost get back to the line of scrimmage\nSo to be second along coming out meantime or in the Colts game the bills we haven't told you for a while they did get on the board with a field goal twenty four to three ah the Colts lead this one over the bills is there are safety though and the game ...\nFor an editor walk fumble there's this safety so are we going to twenty four to five is that the score that we're going to happen now All right I don't think the the cold sores are worried yet but it's twenty four to five and the bills have found better best off ants living their best life it's used their defense which actually is not that bad they don't eat that has been solid that she\nReally good a third in a in the week against the past as far as yards allowed and then ... they have Nineteen on the season to to date Jerry use their defense amen weeds that for four and a half sacks going into this game\nThere are tied for third in that category as well so the passports works\nThis bill defense has been stingy against the past which has been great all year for every NFL up and it seems but Andrew Luck out with a lot of success against them\nGem Newt and certain three just across the Philly thirty health Raleigh will get the first out at a whole lot more down to the fourteen yard line ... is that more ah yeah that was more that goes down to the fourteen yard line so\nGoing to be first in the Panthers desperately need some points down Seventeen announcing\nThat absolutely do look north Turner took over a ... a a coordinator in Carolina him last time he really had success doing that was when he was the head coach of the San Diego then San Diego chargers and Philip Rivers and that theme rent a lot of power\nAnd then they ran a lot of deep routes and pretty much nothing in between and so when you think about that Kim Newton doesn't really fit that strategy as a quarterback\nAnd boy oh boy they ran just a trick play that got work gang busters in the red zone\nBeautiful beautiful reverse there um and so Samuel takes did they get the defense go on one way and they tell us the terminology and around he works its way with the speed in the end zone the Panthers or on the board\nAnd that's what it was about to say so north Turner needs to get more creative with this ... because that strategy will not work in Newton is not accurate down the guilty doesn't do a good job reading coverage when he throws the ball so you need a script in runs from his comfort level you need a script in\nA trick pleasing gadgets just like this one it looked like it was going to be a front side Ron can't took it I'm self taught citizen Samuel it was old and around except from the wide receiver audition he takes it in for the score\nGram granola misses the extra point that we told you if there's anybody mentioned kicks in Philly today give them a path the wind is pretty intense so it's Seventeen to six in favor of Philadelphia\nTen forty one left to go in that game I write down the stretch and into the fourth quarter we go on these games will keep you up to date on all of them that's what we do here on red zone

three ... number one against the spread of five and a five and a free one eight hundred eighty seven all\nCorny to eighty three [noise]\nThey're going to get there to point conversion\nAnd so it certainly is a three point game was the seventeenth one game five minutes to go back to back touchdowns for Carolina\nYeah they had McCaffrey side car right shock on formation and a bunch to the right side as well every single route cleared out away from the right side they all went crossing to the left\nAnd then one sole route went to the flap to the right side can just a couple of steps on the rollout delivered the ball right where it needed to be for the score there to point converted\nAll right so the patriots by the way they did confirmed that interception so Tom Brady has got the ball Baker Mayfield down by two scores but driving inside Tampa territory and we've got this exciting finished coming up between Carolina in Philadelphia So don't move I'm also\nWe continue on red zone radio let's get I lowered here for the fall scoreboard and more\nGuys the bears and patriots were tied at twenty four when Chicago's pot O'Donnell dropped back to punt Bob so see was it the w._b. Z microphone along with our favorite Scott ... don't disappoint a Scott standing on his thirty\nHe has a shoulder high and I got a high power hungry\nDon't know how to say wow\nDante high power in the ... and early in the end zone for the first time in his career\nNew England as a second down and pen coming up they've got the ball up thirty one to twenty four over the bears\nTwo oh nine left to play in the third quarter with the patriots in possession at their thirty one yard line New England with two special teams touchdowns in this game that walk punt return and core Darryl Patterson had a Ninety five yard kickoff return for a touchdown earlier patriots playing without grunt lost so many of my shell in the first half\nWas left knee injury eagles holding onto a Seventeen to fourteen lead over the Panthers for to play in the fourth quarter egos up Seventeen to nothing with ten forty two left in the fourth\nBut since then a fourteen year old ... run by Curtis Samuel that Kim ...\nIn an Eighteen year a touchdown pass to Devon fun just and then a pass on the two point conversion to Jerry us right Panthers have it back now first down antenna from their thirty five yard line\nFor oh eight left to play in the fourth quarter the Vikings up twenty content over the jets after three the lines of twenty nine to fourteen at Miami midway 'cause the for the Tampa Bay adding to their lead over Cleveland is twenty three to nine the bucks leading the browns two and a half into the fourth quarter [noise]\nElsewhere the Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars Jacksonville today they inching\nTheir starting quarterback Blake borders so it's Cody Kessler the former USC Trojan in the game now for Jacksonville he actually led them to a score and they trail the Texans twenty to step in about four minutes into the fourth quarter and the cold with a weird lead over buffalo thirty one\nTo five Andrew Luck for a touchdown passes but then some of the ball out of his end zone for a buffalo safety adding to the bills\nFive points this report presented by true car online car shopping can be confusing not anymore with troop pricing cue car\nNow you can do the exact price you pay for your next car so there's a true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience and non NFL stores have been tracking throughout the day\nThe athletic has now obtained high resolution video that appears to show the Lakers writer John Rondo spitting on Houston's Chris Paul last night ... office had been\nEvaluating a video of the spinning incident throughout the day in fact guys Fox Sports radio is actually obtained exclusive audio of the NBA executives deliberating as they reviewed the video listen [noise] money\nI'm saying\nThat the splits could not have come from behind [laughter] had to have been a second spit or [noise] conspiracy\nTheory out about I think it was low bar\nI he's been quiet lately a but it does not make a lot of noise what'd you say\nThat I Love volleyball the second spit or from that ... that\nAre I mean yelling ILO and mark I stand by and I know it's a little kooky but the magic ... theory is\nWhere I'm Out on [laughter]\nAll right good stuff I think you were alive guy go far sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more and car insurance with Geico guy could calm recall eight under nine four seven auto\nThe only hard part figuring out which way is easier okay Baker\nWe see now uh the browns keep it within seven Nick Chubb era has big gun and he scores a touchdown he's got a nice fourth quarter so far early returns weren't much but now job\nHas sixty two yards on fourteen carries add a touchdown and so Cleveland is still within striking distance twelve Seventeen to go in that game Tampa about to get the ball and nursing a twenty three sixty and lead but the browns still very much alive and after a Josh Gordon drop\nSecond one of the game patriots had to kick and so the bears only trailing by seven I've got the ball back in their hands again they're not their own twenty first second and for\nYeah this is a this is the place you want to be if you're the bears against the patriots you want to stay on track second enforce a manageable down in distance and they're going for it all big passed down out ...\nIncomplete they were looking for Trey Burton he almost caught it then it was almost picked but everything ended up out of bounds\nSo that's that's really the staying on track with you're down in distance does for you because first down you gained six yards you can go first shot down feel like they just took you can run the ball you could run something short as far as the passing game goes you can be very very explosive out that down in distance\nAnd ... I I trust the decision making their\nBig third intent from Philadelphia once throws incomplete\nIncomplete there are no flags and that means that with two twenty eight to go the Panthers did not even have to use any of their time out crowds is just what happens when Doug Peterson says oh yeah like I'm not conservative\nAnd it almost goes through a detriment they're wanting to run the clock they're wanting to South Carolina's time outs they do not have that they throat so many times\nAll of it goes for a net total of nothing Philadelphia is kicking it away their up Seventeen and nothing eight game minutes ago it's Seventeen fourteen generations going to get the ball was to time I was in a two minute warning and plenty of\nTime and we got another scoring the Vikings jets game Vikings with TV is Marie from way out they just crossed over midfield out I was about thirty four yard and uh you might have been longer than that he uh he rushed in from from just beyond the fifty yard line they they were encroaching on jets territory\nAnd the jets random boundary blitz they were on one of the hash marks still left side of the field\nAnd they just ran an inside zone playing that nobody left or contain Murray breaks it to the outside and nobody could catch him after he broke for it\nFor anyone to be exact yeah forty one yard touchdown run for the ... the U.S Murray they now lead the jets twenty seven to ten as we've learned this year don't give up on the Miami Dolphins\nThey just scored again this one is going to go from ... ... am an extra point makes it twenty nine Twenty one I'm eight point game lions about to get the ball back dolphins still and it's six minutes to go in Miami\nNow it's shocking and and here's author shocking piece of evidence from that game\nIs ... going Eighteen of twenty six one hundred and Ninety five through the air and two touchdowns no picks she's been sacked three times so he's been under some ... says he should be map Patricia all defensive coordinator from New England is the head coach there are now calling that defense\nAnd ... uh all of a sudden looks like he did when he was vying for a big contract with Denver didn't get it and got treated over the Houston and sign that big old extension there and then it was you know a game of musical chairs from there is traded to the browns to get rid of the contract and\nAnd so on and so forth he's now the backup in Miami do nice things in place of tannahill who's out with injuries\nAre so let's get back on Cam Newton now who by the way after getting the ball let's go on incomplete incomplete and so briefly it has quickly become\nThird and tend to tend to go still out to time out so in effect three because they've got the two minute warning only ten seconds away\nBut if you can't get it first out it doesn't matter they're out there on thirty one down by three eagles up Seventeen fourteen here's Cam Newton out of the shotgun he'll drop back throw deep over the middle and it is incomplete in almost intercepted\nAnd so they may not even get to the two minute warning or because it is now fourth in ten and I'll ask you Richard this is interesting\nThe two minute warning sort of becomes insignificant here because if you put it away the two minute warning will hit\n... and then you have to time outs\nYou could think about putting here I don't think you will I think you'll go for it even if you don't get it technically game is not completely over still three stoppage of the clock are available but let's stay in the moment first jam note and out of the shotgun\nFrom his own thirty one fourth in ten steps up in the pocket hit as he throws but completes for first down and now more down the right side line and in the eagles territory to the thirty for your line is Torrey Smith\nI don't know how to shake that one out I Would have put fifty yards on Tampa Bay on that plane\nYeah you know it's interesting here the NFL is trying to clean up two things one\nThey don't want their stars John off to each other taunting has been one of these things are basically ruling out of the game altogether and so now it's huge actions asking questions saying hey we're trying to protect these quarterbacks what he joined a little bit and you're saying these are equivalent penalties you doesn't like the offset their\nPatriots have a second goal meantime doubted the two yard line James what's going to take the direct snap run that in touchdown patriots they're up to scores a means time I do think everything got wiped out flag wise is the browns did not move forward any however they will hear from another\nReally good run this one from next job who's really running while you're in that second half\nThe browns are moving into scoring territory first down inside the Tampa Bay thirty yard line\nAnd yet that patriot score on the two yard line was a fly sweep Tom Brady actually took the snap was able to toss it directly in front of his body to white who is coming across the formation just will miss direction there for the score against the bears\nOkay there was a pie I call in Philadelphia that got Philadelphia way down the field and ready to attack to try to win the game but I Believe that get this let's look at the replay you tell me\nI think it's good I mean Carson once it's been picked off by guess who Eric read and that's going to close the game out if indeed this dance and it looks to me like he's got body parts underneath the ball down\nYou know that's clean or it hit him in the vibe board and he was able to trap it between his wrist and his size as you is rolling over\nWhat to believe it was in his left shoulder and yeah no no point did the ball actually touched the grass there in uh in Philadelphia So I think the Carolina Panthers after trailing Seventeen nothing in the fourth quarter now have stormed all the way back and will tap this one off with three nice\nAll right so Philadelphia one Seventeen to go now trailing Twenty one to Seventeen what I don't know is how many of their time outs they use they did not use any of them in that drive so they do have to time outs up or whatever that's worth\nA you imagine here a Carolina is going to be able to then take talk at least one snap away which would get the clock down do something like thirty thirty five science right so you got to get a first time yeah Philadelphia yeah Philadelphia needs a touchdown a field goal won't do it\nSo ah so they're still going to need a first down as it's not a booth review minute for to go well keep you up to date meantime big pals from Baker may feel to David in joke who\nHas got it down inside the ten but two plays and they're still short of the goal line\nUp for the browns so your columns third down\nI think that was Antonio Callaway that got down to about the two yard line checked out it was Jarvis Landry so juice landers that a lot of catches today not a lot of yard\nHere comes second in gold checked out that was first out it was used to start your second goal\nOf the Brahms try to tie it there at the two yard line next job in the backfield by himself now and joker will join about to fall back play auction Baker looking right now throws laugh and that's going to be over everybody's head out of bounds so third down coming up\nDolphins in the desperation situation ... while they're trying to move the ball down the field\nBut they're running a little bit short on time minute fourteen to go second and well now for the dolphins and they are just across midfield still awaiting for boots review answer officially in Philadelphia where the Panthers lead Twenty one Seventeen and we believe they've just picked off Carson went right\nIn front of a goal like yeah they're they're taking their time on this this is playing what are you know I just feel yeah but I I think we'd have the interception\nNext job gets the ball on Thirteen goal in a short short by half\nYard okay five Eighteen to go twenty three sixteen\nFourth and go from the ... are lined you got to go for it yeah you go you're not going to feel the wind the game no knowledge of D.C if he was down and he was there was a ... yards short so here comes the force and go for the browns Baker may feel to get a sneak it they got to push 'em in\nRich I don't think he got it I hold hold my God the buccaneers hold the buccaneers have planted the flag right back acre may filled with a goal line stay and more to say in that game\nComing up [noise]\nThe seven Daniel full flooring yard sales going on now with

he was pretty well covered in oil that was under throw it all\nWorked out west for a lot of our lives in order to get to where God\nBut anyway it works out um and ah the Vikings are in control west shift our focus over to Tampa Bay forty two seconds to go box and browns are tied but James Winston\nHas brought his team in the field goal range so now they're set things up there also pitchers trying to run out the clock just had a huge third in one conversion by hitting the ball off to James White he converts first and then the bears still have\nTo time out and the two minute warning about the ball is just across midfield up to forty eight so even if they get it back it's going to be deep in their own territory and make cannot let Tom Brady to get any more first down here is the first intent play toss white\nDo James White and he's going to get seven making eight and the patriots are really good shape there about two yards away from one of those guys\nThat looked like the exact same play they ran to win the Superbowl against that land and were white and the backfield right so they just toss it out three receivers side they gotta crack block to steal the inside and just a bunch of receivers on support players and so he rumbles forward after he makes contact with the first tackle or as well down field\nFor a A R gain on first down so they're sucking into and they're eating up a bunch of the clock here in Chicago which is exactly what you need to do in the form and then often\nTake a look at his desk by camera and break you tell me if this is complete or not or he catches yet but as is going to the ground takes a big hit and the ball is kind of jarred loose for a moment there it is yeah and then it hits the ground he's got his arm around it the whole time it's a little loose that's going to be a tough\nCall I I I Do believe it will be in in completion because it seemed like the the ball was jarred enough loose about uh the belly of the ball make contact with the ground and so whenever that happens it it feels like they're gonna they're going to overturn a couch call\n'em they are a reviewing that right now on the field\nUm and this is significant because the box first of all that was going to be a conversion for first down gets them a little bit closer and comfortable in the field goal range if that's overturned\nThat's going to change that feel position and situation with forty five seconds left to go in a tie game Sam Donaldson jets on the field now and a desperation situation throwing the ball down feel under five minutes to go Vikings lead that one thirty for Seventeen\nAnd were underway in Baltimore where Drew Brees is on the road out doors against the best defense in football at least statistically or this is a this is a situation where the saints off and we'll probably need to try to at least of all of a little bit from what they do inside their home building\nYeah and we more on the run game so when we were speaking earlier about this and if you you bring in mark Ingram what a wonderful game and his return off suspension last week against Washington\nAnd you give them more touches out of the ... field if you rush Kamara if you get creative closer to the line of scrimmage to get the ball out of breezes hands as quickly as possible you don't want to the situation like a Kurd against Tennessee where Mario to get ... eleven times\nI think breezes better at that three step drop stuff and so they won't have that situation but yeah trust running game if I'm\nNew Orleans and do we have a Sam Donaldson\nWe got another one yeah Sam Donald ... obviously now is in a desperation situation so you don't worry about forcing things a little bit\nAh he did although actually check it out and that was perfect pass them as receiver just added bounce right off of his chest plate and the Vikings I get the interception and now have the ball in great territory where the Seventeen point lead the Vikings are going to win in New York\nToday yeah you had a receiver kind of short on that one when you're when you're running a slant or any inside route against zone coverage you know that you're going to pay for any of those catches so we try to arm that one in instead of catching it with his hands and seeing it in\nA to be able to protect themselves and so that bounces off his arms into the hands of awaiting the fender Minnesota has the same opportunity that New England does in that game trying to eat as much of the clock as possible but there's four minutes twenty three seconds left on the clock so potentially another score for Minnesota yeah\nNo doubt about that All right they did call the camera and break catch a couch they did not overturned it on a ... run the ball up in the middle one time they might do it one more time or just Neal it to get the right spot on the field that's exactly what James Winston will do\nAnd so they're down at the twenty three yard line timeout two seconds left to go on the clock of a tie game the buccaneers will try to come out and witnessed one where they kick remember their kicker already missed an extra point today\nThat oh no he broke free but now they're going to call him down down down at the forty five\nSo the ... to the way you're sort of plan for a tie ah yeah this is what\nI hate stop with the overtime claw\nI I don't think they do it I mean look you Jackson often to coach I'm pretty sure he's going to want it in the hands of his plane makers she and so I'd assume you'll see dolphins on the field but who knows maybe doesn't want to withstand another lost their jobs so they he will punish its\nFourth in ten I get it you're you're really helping the bucks too much and they're still over four minutes left to go like the chance of getting the ball back\nThe point goes into the end zone James once it will take over or at his own twenty five for eleven I'll have to go his own twenty I should say a for a weapon left to go in that game still not done in New York\nThirty seven seven team the Vikings lead final method apply so they're just taking things out there and as they do that let's get ILO in here for full update on what we got going on everywhere around the week seven league\nGuys we start with a fantastic finish at soldier field here are the patriots leading the bears thirty eight to thirty one\nTwo seconds on the clock Chicago's a mission trip is about to unleash a Hail Mary with the line of scrimmage the bear forty five yard line and guess who's going to take it from there on WB the stars of our show all day long Bob so see and the irrepressible Godzilla lack\nOf scrimmage the forty five yard line fares territory high bigger\nPart and that's the bears call let's see if we can find the patriots Collier my fault okay here is the patriots call this is so see ends olack [laughter]\n\n\n[laughter]\nPrayer for Chicago we\nYes\nOh I bet you exactly what you're going to do it out\nI think I don't like kind of ... I Love the gap I think he kind of ran out of gas theory and\nThese are all ... it was a long\nDay checks going to have her on the hill during the week to work on his conditioning on that what anyway the patriots\nThirty eight to thirty won their first road when they're five and two bears three and three New England remember one it without drunk they also lost Sony Michel in the first out with a left knee injury the Panthers trailer Philadelphia Seventeen to nothing with ten forty two to play in the fourth\nBut scored two touchdowns to make it a three point game and then Carolina was a yard away from the lead almost unbelievably with Ninety seconds to go\nDown and do the one yard line and her most of those in those hot also touched down at the top of the ...\nThat was the Carolina radio crew in God doesn't want to be rude but that was a little less enthusiastic and I would have expected\nWhat the heck is wiggle motions there down Seventeen nothing with ten forty two left to the super bowl champions on the road they rally to score the game winning touchdown and this is the enthusiasm\nDown as one yard line and her most of those into hot also touched down at the top of the ... [noise]\nI don't get it wiggled motion noodle route\nOkay touchdown I guess Olson scores so he did have the debut of the side car phrase earlier so that was pretty good care a lot of what the Twenty one to Seventeen lions when Miami thirty two to Twenty one carry on Johnson ran for one fifty eight Texans want to Jacksonville twenty to seven in the game that saw the jaguars bench Blake border\nCulture over the bill is thirty seven to five earlier in London the chargers defeat of Tennessee twenty to Nineteen again the two game still going on right now\nBrown and boxer tied at twenty three in overtime Tampa Bay as a first in ten at the Cleveland forty eight with three twelve leapt on the clock next score wins\nAnd it's just gone final the Vikings with the thirty seven to Seventeen victory over the jet strengthen ravens scoreless three to go in the first rams and nine or ... three and a half into the ball game\nDallas and Washington School is three and a half and finally one baseball no earlier today the angels named Brad Osman says their new manager succeeding Mike social fellas\nHey I Love great stop let me tell you something about this Tampa Bay Cleveland game the buck stalled they punted the browns we're going to get the ball back they received apart and on the return they bungled\nThe return that's why the buccaneers how the ball at the forty eight yard line it was going to be Brown's ball at midfield they fumble the puck return with just over three minutes to go\nIn this over time period and so it's a box that will get it around midfield they've got a second and then at the browns forty eight yard line but keep in mind as James Winston does complete a pass for about seven\nI'm Out to the sideline back to my job in third and two coming up keep in mind both of these squads have out all kinds of problems in the kicking game and especially Tampa Bay today so a dot\nCanon sorrows missed two already that reason why they're in this mess to begin with the twenty three twenty three it would have been over and done with earlier how'd he converted on the last second kick\n'em means I'm the Redskins are going to strike first against the cowboys today after a three it out\nFor the cowboys here come the Washington Redskins\nAnd I think it was to pre bibs was it ... it was twenty three yards screen past ... believes he scores extra point guard Washington up seven to nothing early at home\nAgainst Dallas I'm All right we're going to get the stage that the end of the game between Cleveland in Tampa\nAnd everything going on with the lake games as well or live in the guy go far sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent I'm On car insurance where a guy called Geiger comical eight or nine four seven out of the only ... figured out which way it's easier\nBut before we get back to the games let's take another world around unfair to to check a\nBox sports fantasy ticket [noise]\nAll right we're going to start in what was probably the fantasy game of the day took ways edge soldier field the bears lost that doesn't mean they're often some players didn't do a lot of good\nBears trying to make one score affair I wanted to write a service takes this now sets to throw why\nThey lose it thirty eight thirty one but you're being ski where the huge day three hundred and thirty three yards through the air do such downs to pick anyone yards rushing out a touchdown run as well bears radio network\nJim shares the last name with the physicist Isaac but guess what he doesn't believe in gravity I Will not today he fly high in Philadelphia\nDown and do the one yard line and her we do most of those into town at the top of the ...\nThat some wiggle motion of God the fact is we all know that they just want a football game how about a little exercise Nunes twenty five thirty nine to sixty nine through their two touchdowns and also you know he's dead and then with his legs as well average seven yards a carry seven charities for forty nine yards\nGuy might end up being vive value pick all the entire fantasy season partially because all the way the patriots using but also because of injuries around him James White [noise]\nSecond\nNature to expand their lead back\nTo ... by the way for Cleveland pushing the bucks back out of Cleveland territory approaching a two minute warning there James White forty hours on the ground fifty seven through the air Jew touchdowns through the air as well patriots radio network\nEverybody was talking about the quarterbacks walking into this game bills at Indianapolis to play the colds for the bills lack of a quarterback and ... a newly recovered quarterback Andrew Luck but it was the ... century", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Bill Handel", "city": "Tampa", "day": "21"}
