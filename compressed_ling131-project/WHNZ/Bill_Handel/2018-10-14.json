business say a small business but some of the challenges that people have to start those businesses a lotta times his initial capital outlay\nYou got to Lisa building you got to rent a facility or read to quit meant to how's that facility you got liability insurance you might have employees and staff in payroll and workers' comp and\nYou know inventory there's a lot of there's a lot of things that go into starting a traditional business and a lotta people follow that path because it's the dream I mean you know the American dream land of opportunity go build something right your own tickets have equity work so hard to own something\nAnd they love the opportunity and see a lot of people struggle with a lot of people driving down the road right now you're a small business owner\nYou own your business and your business owns you and I know I've been that guy I've been that person who was a small business owner I was a builder\nI was a framer I did a lot of construction projects and you know what I was always chasing money and chasing clients and trying to get people to sign off on punch list like get paid and so I understand that headache when that traditional process of building a business\nThen you look at the financial markets trading and investing you can sort of business on a shoestring you literally can enter the arena with a couple of grant maybe even less than that if you're treating currencies I mean hundreds of dollars I mean it doesn't have to be a big pile of money you have the ability to sell and by\nInstantly so if you understand what a good price to buy isn't a good price to sell is how to buy a wholesale sort of retail gives you a tremendous admission you'd have to leave your house you have\nCustomers that you'd never have to meet that are willing

do\nAnd I got excited and was able to start to venture out of this field and many people that's their entry into the arena is it they look at it as a way to start a business without a ton of capital and have the American dream still be able to exist without a lot of traditional headaches that most business have and once you start to understand a real opportunity\nAnd the real power of understanding how to take the money consistently in the financial markets\nMan it can really go to the next level and I've seen it happen a lot of people's lives for middle is as it could happen to

the first half Washington a Seventeen to six halftime\nLead over the Carolina Panthers the Seahawks win the Seventeen to nothing halftime lead over the raiders\nA game being played at ... stadium in London\nRaider receiver Omari Cooper being evaluated for a concussion after taking a blatant helmet to helmet shot from Bradley McDougal of the sea hawks that was somehow not tantalize even Scotland

over the bills thirty seven seconds of the third quarter the chargers up Twenty one to three at Cleveland with eight seconds left in the second quarter Philip Rivers of half touchdown passes that Tyra Williams including the one that mark and what you're talking about a moment ago twenty nine you order that counted despite a blatant\nFalse start by charters left tackle Russell ... it was a missed by the officials the touched down in the books Cleveland is just added and other field goal so they are now Twenty one to six to the chargers at halftime and finally also asked on the jets up twenty three to Thirteen over the Indianapolis Colts\nMark and rich you are right against self ... very much appreciate it where our live and the guy called Fox Sports radio studios easy to say Fifteen Percent or more conscious of Geico go to guy could are calm recall eight or nine four seven out of the only hard part\nFigured out which ways easier also brought to buy discover card we treat you like you'd treat you venture saying about charger brown game the way he Jackson is playing this and they had to kick that field goal I Know right before halftime on third down and we're going to hold everything 'cause there's a flag on the play\nA field goal was good points are on the board but the clock reads zero and there's a flag on the field that everyone still in the field so we'll find out what's going on there but the browns about two trips to the red zone just the last ten minutes\nAnd potentially they're only coming out of that with three points are because the last time in there the browns actually they were just outside the reds on there are about up to twenty five yard line out a forced into\nWe talked about this earlier the lack of confidence in kicking at that time it was fourteen to three your jacket elected to go for it instead of kicking a field goal and they pass was incomplete\nWaffling in these situations I think he realized okay um I trusted my our fence to get it done and it didn't work and\nYou have an opportunity to close the gap a little bit here make this a to score game if you add in at least one to point conversion on one of those two touchdowns scores\nAnd you're you're right back in this ball game right so I think instead of creating a situation a situation where you're off ensues has confidence in him in itself you give your kick her an opportunity here's the thing about that play we just saw it was called on the defense the the rush team against the field goal\nAnd so instead of taking it on time down\nIt's halftime and they have the six points on the board from that that field goal or the penalty being declined that field goal being ruled good\nAnd so yeah yeah look this is the worst showing in the first half I Believe we see now the browns so far this season and Baker may feel since you started and has never look more wobbly at the position\nAnd I think some of that has to do with that early ankle or need tweak we saw\nIn the near side when he stepped out of bounds on the the first down monitor any twist it up a little bit so he's he may be playing hurt\nAnd that's the sort of stuff that you really need to see out of your starting quarterback\nHow does he play when it comes out of the locker room and he's down to scores at half time\nHow does he play when he's hurt this is an unfriendly week from both those standpoint you're going to play down a lot you're going to play hurt a lot what are you got number six they're going to be relying on you for the remainder of your coat career to be the guy even though the situation is stacked up against\nYou well in the charger defense I'll have my eyes on them still know Joey both are but I Know that when you you get a rookie quarterback\nOr in a situation like that where the defense is going to know exactly what you're doing Cleveland's gonna move away from the run game now\nThat's a dangerous spot where turnover is going to happen\nAnd uh and the chargers have some ball hawks back there there are when James and whatnot and so uh we'll see how that factors into the second out Twenty one to sex penalty was on the charges so declined it's halftime Twenty one to six and your daily fantasy play of the day so far has been ... well you know I Know where you could probably get on the super cheap\nThree catches one hundred eighty nine yards and to score is coming up in ten minutes we'll give you our first fantasy ticker of the dead also let's go back to Miami we haven't been there since that opening Dr touchdown for bronchitis wild and there's been a good reason for it nobody else is going in the game\nYou know what I had an early conversation off the air or I stated I'm not yet a believer in the bears off ants in what I mean by that is not that they're not improve they definitely are\nAnd nothing in certain spots they won't perform like they did when we last saw them once you're busy had six steps down throws\nAgainst the bus defense which gives up a lot but today I I I just felt like this wasn't going to be a good spot for them I don't know if it's an often said as I Would say travels yet\nLook at the rams off and they go up to Seattle yeah thirty something points again it's an office to travel I don't think the bears are there yet they've started the second half they still got to say on the board\nYeah you know and this is one of the league's best defenses I I mean you're talking about not add that bottom third Miami you know the dolphins they they've they've under perform for some of the the the reasons that you know and um it can sue is no longer there he didn't really work out so now to\nA huge bad move by them not making it work with sue or so so no issue there but but this isn't a particularly talented defense and they've held them at bay through this game so far interested to see how this game\nUh works out on the other side of the half because I I really do have a lot of faith the matinee game what he's been able to do with some of the pieces in place in Chicago and some of the pieces they've added obviously at the tight end position but beyond that\nThis to me is a multiple option often ... out of the backfield with Colin and and Howard I'm I I think they're they're I think they're going to be the surprise of the NFL season we'll see how it goes well\nThey got a really good thing going on in the first minute of the second half in that make up fitzpatrick was just called for a deep ball down the field pass interference\nAnd so the bears have got the ball right now in the red zone\nA section in four at the Miami nine yard line so see if they can turn this into six maybe tied the game right there to recall on who you just mentioned are just got a short pass for six yards on first down getting them inside the tent yard line so keep uh keep you are up to date on that one also that you know that the bills are on the board for the first time\nIn the form of a field goal tend to three the Texans lead the bills early third quarter or the Sean watching has been picked off twice in this game and I'm having a very difficult time on a weekly basis\nFiguring out exactly who the Buffalo Bills are I mean they're people will call them the worst in the NFL but there are two and three there hanging in here\nThey've had some really good defensive performances that ticked off walked in twice today Kurt what they did occur cousins a few weeks ago\nJosh Allen I does not have much going on in the passing game but his athletic and does strange things out of the pocket I just don't know what we're going to get from them wait\nTill we they are a bit strange but they've had some special teams miss cues during this game of blocked punt ... return so that ten point disparity favoring disarm Watson is really the second chance opportunities the bills how to bail them special teams why\nBut but here's the side of the day the bills have been held to fifty three told the total yards of our fence in the first half\n... that's the work for the worst performance so far we six in the NFL in the first step so that builds need to start generating some up and since I'm making so many mistakes on special teams in order for them to have any ... uh in Houston today\nBears doing did get that score ... to Trey Burton and the extra point wait for it is now is well\nGood for a change because it hasn't been that way across the league but that's exactly what I was just talking about this matinee ... the incorporation of Trey Burton that tight end he has been one of the key performers in this happens to specially when they knew the goal line they get creative just like ...\nMock sports fantasy ticket [noise]\nWe're gonna start in Atlanta in a game that we knew without fireworks and it didn't take long they do\nColeman states that have to go back and here's a play fake right gotta slipping across here so it's a funny than the fact\nYou mean Mohammed ... knew the guy picked up to play for one week in my fifth call themselves a big all long\nThirty five yard touchdown play the game the falcons radio network yes indeed Mohammed new and Matt Ryan has been a off to a nice start and again the falcons lead twenty four to Thirteen\nLos Angeles goes on the road and didn't forget their chargers\nRiver states the handoff step to his lap wants the end zone puts it up in the air for grabs and that ball is up for grabs in the end zone I don't know if it was intercepted cut out\nThe charges radio network right here in town but hey check this out it was real well is everybody had him on the fantasy team or maybe not but he is the third ranked overall player fantasy at this point on this Sunday three reception hundred Eighteen yards to touch down and there were long lines\nJust they were now let's go all the way across the bomb for Russell Wilson doing Russell Wilson\nThinks there's a shotgun saffron samples fake sets up most of\nBarriers for the sea hawks or enjoying a twenty to nothing advantage on the raiders right now at Russell Wilson on the sea hawks radio network is a big part of the reason Wilson with a couple of touch down throws today\nUh Cincinnati Reds rocket doing everything he can to win this even Steven at halftime the darn lucky to throw his\nPath\nKnow how\nTo set a touchdown\nYeah having a great day but let's check out Tyler Boyd another receiver who is just cracking at all today three reception only twenty five yards targeted by times but two touchdowns so far that one was easy the first one was easy I guess the shops a staple\nIf there is screaming by the color analysts during a touchdown you do with the bangles touched down what was the Colorado was for the bangles doing I miss\nThe hard for me to hear everything so I guess\nThere it is\nFeelers radio network WD the w._b. Gigi James ... yards to touch down one catch for forty hours a day as well\nBack to that charges game visiting Cleveland we go to\n... go takes all alone left now in motion to pitch their Gordon hurdles bender got the side of the garden of gold gold touched charger\nVoted out that a lot he jumps over a lot of people he's a he hasn't been known to be a hurdle or but he absolutely does gory a lot in fantasy soap bar through the air to receptions Eighteen year olds on three targets nine roaches ticks\nYeah and you heard that score there how to leap over someone's earn it but they're on the board is Melvin Gordon\nEditor Nineteen to lead for the Vikings over the cardinals you officially have a man crush almost hideous Murray and why is that kind of Jan cousins under center hands to ... [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter]\nOne hour of\nCourse that Kay fair to the Vikings radio network moody Viking leave this one is what it is that where are we going back to Cleveland go figure her and say\nWe got movement on the left they did not catch in reverse want the end zone John taught\nShot you're well William yet so this is the other side of that call it's Phillip Rivers who's quietly having something that looks like an MVP he's continues on the road in Cleveland nine of Fifteen passing a hundred Seventy eight through the air\nWith to touch rounds both of them complement of his receiver number sixteen ...\nJews noticed Tyler Boyd on three catches for twenty five yards second half of our time coming out back\n[noise] [noise]\nThings are looking for those who have problems winning in the past because Michael Rose he's giving it away and legal rose guarantee seven winters against the spread out of every penny releases reverse or sees the holy handicappers good enough for confident enough to release his winters we live in a recording\nThese games will do the talking salesmen call now from Michael roses through football lock of the week hundreds real five zero zero for the single biggest flee Michael rules\nWeek week you get it and I think you get it absolutely free on a recorded message one eight hundred three or five zero zero zero four\nI just called and it's on there right now I didn't speak to a salesman I didn't leave personally for me and I simply call one eight hundred three o five zero to zero for\nPro football last week's absolutely free that's one eight hundred three or five zero zero for\nEight hundred three or five zero to zero or\nWell when we were helpful\nBought our first I ... [noise] downloaded [noise]\nTalk horse trending\nThat very few can he is a generational player\nAssuming he stays healthy I think he's going to be one of the greats in New York for a long time to come however quarterback\nNot well protected by us up into one and this isn't a dynamic guy to start with it's not like he's running out of people's way it's like a Russell Wilson or extending plays like Ben Roethlisberger in his prime ordinary Rogers now even hobbled within the injury you are ... not not mobile so you need to protect them\nHowever I Will say this on the opposite side of the docket Darnell he came into this game without Quincy anew and\nHe's got an ankle and so he's replaced by Trump prior and so you can make the same argument he's facing challenges this weekend as well and what does he do he throws a touchdown throw prior so guys I I'm I'm just\nI'm just saying yeah you can start to make as many excuses as you want for quarterback but eventually you got to shine a light on the position that matters the most in all sports\nNo doubt about it in Miami now threatening back or just outside the Chicago red zone so they're going to try to stay in it on that one\nBangles don't go anywhere on their next drive so trailing Seventeen to fourteen or the bangles and now the Steelers get the ball back James Carter with just a bowling ball of a rod and get up dear midfield\nFive

James Connor and then again perfect their store all pro linebacker comes up and tries to make contact with ... he tosses him to shrugs off to tackle against first down your heart is it is a slug fest in Cincinnati\nNo doubt about it so keeping an eye on that very close game also can add that a field goal was just out by the box don't give up on them yet the falcons all fenced it started to stole a little bit\nAnd late third quarter suddenly the bugs are only down by one score it's a twenty four to sixteen game in that what it is weak six National Football league and this is red zone radio were

Sam Darnell twenty three of twenty nine for two Seventy six but to touchdown passes and an interception market rich\nOkay let's go to Miami where his feet in rock us why alert to Albert Wilson touchdown to point conversion good Thai ball games so that interception from mixture basically a few minutes ago incredibly damaging as the bears were up by eight\nA trip is in the bears looking to score and more\nAnd instead he throws a pick the dolphins taking all the way down the field the other way we ourselves ... minutes to go\nAnd you know it's funny I'm I'm starting to remember the commentary used to ... when the world love them some block when he was with the Denver Broncos and shades of his time as the sun devil at ASU and his time as\nThe the the head honcho in Denver while I was waiting for the sheriff Peyton Manning to return to the fold in the postseason\nOr he can run around a little bit and extend plays any flash that arm off that six foot eight frame for the touchdown or I should say the two point conversion corner than zone so yeah a great adjustment of wean pressure and making a nice play outside the pocket\nAll right and then we also have a lot of eyes in Cincinnati we're down the stretch we come with six twenty two to go in the game and right now the Steelers out the ball and the lead Seventy to fourteen but a second intent in their own territory is coming up and just a moment is a really good football game they're Redskins out the ball up\nOne of the Seventeen we'll keep an eye on that falcons up by two they've got the ball in buccaneers territory twenty four twenty two is the score there and the Houston Texans have now got something going just under four minutes to go they've got a first and goal of the buffalo a trailing by three\nWe're going to get the exciting conclusion of these early games what does it mean guy go says it's fifty minutes says if they present a moron car insurance should have gone to guide dot com Fifteen minutes ago that's that the the ... got the ball two minutes going down six an adult and got the ball where [noise]\nTwo twenty five to go [noise] down by six [noise] James Winston got\nThe Ball Four minutes to go down by nine may need a couple of stores there's Dalton from midfield throwing right sideline incomplete are they going to get a wag do mixed in looking for one\nDoesn't look like it but they got a flag on the previous why to give them a first down inside Pittsburgh territory that's a really good non call actually right there\nAnd we got to touch down in the Chicago dolphins game\nGuy Mr ... um who's on the receiving end here was that was that Howard was Jordan Howard I missed the play I just saw him\nNo no our word and it was Anthony Miller ended Miller over the middle of the field\nWas by himself ... touchdown bears\n... hill three Seventeen to go there but that would give them the touchdown advantage and then ... is going to ah see what he can do extra for extra points 'cuse me as good twenty eight Twenty one bangles\nFirst out in the Steelers territory now at about ... thirty four yard line and they'll let that one run down to the two minute warning I keep saying this game it's just been so good the Steelers and the bangles even if the I'm going to say that even if the bangles come away with the last I think in many ways\nAre in this game they've held up okay to sort of validate their foreign one start\nAnd I think the Steelers up officially shaken off whatever emotional issues they were going through early in the season\nWhether it was related to Libya on bell or any of the other dramatic issues surrounding that team they've got it right it they blew out Atlanta last week\nIf they can hold on and get a road went in Cincinnati there three to and wanted in pretty good shape\nWell the craziest thing about the Steelers is this just happens all the time\nThey always have some off the field issue lingering with the starting quarterback or the star receiver or they have a defender who's unhappy with the way he's being treated by the officiating crew or its Tomlin with certain actions on the sidelines tripping players\nThey always have drama follows the Pittsburgh Steelers and you don't expect it I think because during the AFC\nNorth and this is hard nose grind it out football you don't expect to see that sort of level of drama but it appears every single year so if there's a team\nWho is apt to handle that it's a team that goes through it on a consistent basis that's the Pittsburgh Steelers and they've had success through it all so until they showed that chicken the armor where they no longer can can\nKeep that to prop this up so to speak I Hope that belief that Pittsburgh is going to Hamad up they're going to figure it out at some point in the season and like I said many times\nNobody is winning Super Bowls in September\nEverybody or or like even if your team is one in three leaving the first four games of the season everybody likes overreact\nNothing's official until we hit yeah turkey time\nHere comes a broadcast while they're on the dolphins are going to get a really nice\nGoing all the way he's at the thirty but it's funny that then you got to find his way and he will touchdown other dolphins come right back with a one\nPlay drivers that Albert Wilson again Albert Wilson again\nAnd this was in simple even broadcast while they're throwing his hands up there like I don't know what I did I tell you what you did you throw the ball over the middle of the field for five yards at all but wells and did the rest unbelievable we're still shy of the three minute mark and now we're extra point away from a tie game again in Miami\nWell this is this is the danger you run into in the NFL this day and age you're going to see a lot more men coverage because when you played zone what you're relying on as your defenders making plays coming up and snapping out receivers well you can't do that anymore because they throw a flag when you hit receivers down\nFeel from the secondary sushi Mormon coverage and when yeah man coverage and you spread the field with all the receivers it takes beating one guy and then you're off to the races\nAnd so we're seeing a lot more of this in the league these days Albert Wilson do a tremendous effort a single singularly responsible for the dolphins are taking are accusing nodding it up here in the waning moments of this game\nExtra point is good so the game is tied the buccaneers are going to get a touchdown that's painting barber over the middle of the cats from James Winston\nThree forty seven on the clock it's a three point game with an extra point on the way so the buccaneers still have work to do there was a second and sent for an adult and over the middle complete down to the eleven yard line and again it's AJ green\nAnd so that's a first and then from eleven minutes forty four to go the Steelers lead twenty to fourteen but the Bengals are going to have\nA few shots at the end zone right here also pass along\nThe Texans momentarily that Dr stalled they kicked a field goal to tie and there were two minutes left to go Nathan Peter men on the drive to try to win the game for buffalo\nPick six Houston Nineteen bills Thirteen minutes twenty three to go Peter mid strikes again\nYeah Peter men look he's had a limited opportunities in this league or he was thrust into action on the road in LA to face the chargers when the Buffalo Bills inexplicably bench to rod Taylor\nAnd he threw five first half interceptions and basically it hasn't improved drum there he's done some nice things he's done many many bad things even as a backup coming in the game where the defenses unprepared\nFor okay bangles second in three from before they'll hand a mixed in and is in touchdown for the Cincinnati Bengals and may have even to the game and again\nYou know what happens now the extra
