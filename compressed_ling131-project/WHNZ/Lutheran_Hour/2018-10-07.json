M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nThe giver of life now gifts the couple with the ability to create more of what God loves so much and let's not misunderstand as even though man and woman have the ability to create a life together is only one God gifts to them that all life is actually created he is lord\nAfter all [noise]\nSo we're once no lights existed now life in many forms exists today and God's crowning achievement that of mankind has since grown to over seven billion people\nIn such a huge number it is hard to not feel a little in significant\nI think families who are blessed with three four five or ten children and how some of the siblings feel as if they aren't even noticed among many others in their own home vying for the attention of their parents and as a parent it can be challenging to give equal amounts of time to each child\nSome demand more than others and it isn't wrong it just is what it is\nThat said though our heavenly father has no such limitations no he is greater and he has kept a watchful eye on his entire creation and each individual he's created with the attention is if we were the only one on earth\nBefore I foreign Jew in the womb I knew you says God each life before even coming into existence God has cast his gaze upon delighting in having a hear his voice and that we would be led home to him\nNow if you don't know the story it isn't only about the good stuff no there\nIs the part where death entered where God had created so much life\nGod's enemy the devil the great liar and deceive her chained to destroy that which God loves the most you see the devil cannot be God nor take his place in fact when the devil tried God banished him and send him away from the heavenly places\nHating God as the devil does though knowing his powerless to feeding God one on one the devil targets God's crowning achievement seeking to hurt God by hurting those he loves\nJust as he did with the first man and woman in the garden the devil continues telling lies that\nWe can be like God creators of our own destiny is that we should focus on what we want and try to get it at any cost don't worry be happy for that is what you see you can trust me I can show you how to\nGet it once created in the image of God our lives got twisted and turned upside down and where once we walk with God now are natural inclination is to walk to the beat of our own drum\nWhere before we would have seen the value in every one who was created in God's image we now see them as a means to Iran's obstacles to our goals or simply\nInconveniences wars now exists among people's tribes and nations as we seek to get our own wants Matt we may lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we place the lives of others over\nWe may see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value than those born typical\nMaybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden\nYet to think this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company\nAnd the gospel of John we recall the account of where Jesus killed the blind beggar in their travels de Jesus and the disciples\nPass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth\nAnd his disciples asked him rabbi who send this man or his parents that she was born blind and Jesus answered it was not that this man send or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking\nFor this man had a God given purpose\nWhen a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as merely inconvenient not worthy of having right now has this new life is in a way of the plans we have made for ourselves\nThroughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not\nWanting to raise children with birth defects to those concede due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion\nTwisted in the devils lives as we are we may no longer see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting sin has caused us to become towel a sub scene in life as having great value from the one who gives a\nDead as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly said it\nWould be good could bringing a disabled child into this world possibly bring\nWhat purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring chair for a long time stripping them of their ability to be active citizen\nEven though it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away\nIt isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today and until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want\nWith it we\nNeed not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock us at times looking at strangers seeing how they are dressed or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own\nBut what if we are wrong what if our sitting\nWritten reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image oh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold cell value above others in this world should be seen as\nA sign of sickness you see all were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it\nAnd God loves that so much that he wants that all would be saved and if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing that right\nTo choose its existence or not and as Christians we cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to see God by his word to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia is also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives\nYet using evil for good as God does all lives how purpose we may not see it as crowded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils wise but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he is you see God is a servant king\nEach action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen thinking we\nKnow better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to the bus\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserve nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how loved you are you must see how enemies as we are God's still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still hold precious value to him\nAll lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts maybe then we can see how his love extends to every one everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift", "show_name":
