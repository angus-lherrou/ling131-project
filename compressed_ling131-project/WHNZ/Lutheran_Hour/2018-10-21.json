I've always been a fan of that have a breakfast like a king and lunch like a queen and dinner like a ... a type approach yeah and a a guy professor or I'm Bill Judy ... a stress to me that the uh\nThe the most um leaned culture generally went to bed hungry\nUh and um I I've always use that when I find wait a sneaking up on me I I find it most effective to cut back or the the late meal people argue with me about that\nTomorrow in Spain in Spain you're saying that they eat dinner they have a big meal in the middle of the afternoon and then dinner late at night later and that much later that's\nCorrect but that's not typical for Europe as a whole I I feel that in most of the European countries the the people are eating six thirty seven o'clock rush [noise]\nWow [noise] I Know in Italy or in the afternoon [noise] everything after twelve why one o'clock everything shuts down for the afternoon for about two or three hours\nAnd then the shops it will reopen ... right around for wherever and then you have dinner around eight eight thirty [noise] ... that they shut things down I mean there's like a ... ... right\nOr something very similar in Spain or Italy and Vilonia we have a distributor in Vilonia and do they go to coffee shops in the morning and sometimes don't get to work till ten or they they read the paper and talk to their friends and I think it's quite I'm healthy way of living if you can figure out how to do it\nHere here in the U.S I Believe we we all have to look down on that kind of behavior and a um we think we have to work all the time and if we're not in the office early and um uh we we feel guilty but um I they they seem to be is just as productive as people here\nThat's interesting isn't it they managed to get work done [noise] they they're they're they're not as obsessed with work but yet get work done and I understand that vacations or in some of these countries people were given for six weeks vacation\nI think it's a very good system and most of the European countries they're given three or four weeks off in the summer and they all take vacation at once so they can really relax other companies shut down and then they get another two or three weeks off in around the turn of the year in Christmas Time [noise]\nMan [noise]\nJeeze so there are there are distinct differences then\n... absolutely a those are some of the positive things I Do I see I I think that they do [noise]\nMhm [noise] well we're here to learn a I'm a I'm always intrigued with what do other countries do and how do they do it with what was what a success does it make a difference in\nHow we live of course it does eliminate a PHD in anything to figure it out but the question becomes what are the things that we can do in day to day life that make up for better

Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff today questions whether the president's seeing the case only with money motives in mind\nSomeone said that our world has been so quickly inoculated with Christianity that very likely will never catch the real thing is there a real saying\nSomething you can hang onto if so what is it I Want to talk to you for just a few minutes about the real thing the one that never changes it's what we preach about on this program\nWe preach Christ crucified St Paul said that\nHe went on to say that wherever he preached Christ crucified\nHe was met by in credulity and skepticism body weight breach Christ crucified he said under the Jews that is to the people who took religion seriously a stumbling block and under the Greeks\nThat is the people who were intellectual foolishness but under them which are called both Jews and Greeks without discrimination Christ the power of God\nAnd the wisdom of God it did not bother to St Paul's that people could not seem to understand the simple fact of Christ cross or did not even want to try to understand it\nHe did not modify is preaching a water it down because of this fact he just said this is what we preach we preach Christ crucified take it or leave it but when you don't even remember what you are leaving behind and what it is going to mean to you\nWe preach Christ crucified at St Paul's way of saying that saying or whatever other named you wanted to give to a departure from God and his law\nIs a costly business it costs some body crucifixion it costs us most of all those of us who are singers and whoever else is not a singer\nSeeing makes cowards of us all and it makes us enemies as well you've heard him and say I'm In the doghouse these days what do you mean to say is that he made an appointment with his wife to select\nOh paper for the living room and then forgot all about it he promised to bring home ice cream for dinner and failed to remember his promise he came in and out of the rain and track ... over the living room run\nIt takes a good case and maybe a bouquet of flowers the next day to get things straightened out all too often being in the doghouse is not only a matter of our having encouraged the anger if somebody else\nBut it's a matter of two of our setting up a wall between them and us through our own feeling of guilt we don't want to give we don't want to admit that we were wrong it only makes things worse to know that we were wrong and that's the situation in which every man finds himself with God\nThe meaning of Christ cross is that God took the initiative to break that wall down to get us out of their spiritual dog house\nAnd this was known me or tactical maneuver around his pot he loved us he pity dies he determined that nothing should be allowed to stand in a way of that love is even if it meant taking all our guild upon himself\nGod so love the world that he sent his only be gotten son all we like she had gone astray we turned everyone to his own way but the lord laid on him the inequity of us all\nHe was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our inequities upon him was laid the chest is meant that made us hole and with his stripes we are here we preach Christ crucified St Paul said that\nAs if there is a connection between the cross and now we're seeing\nAnd there is as St Paul said to the collections God has forgiven you all your sins\nHas utterly wiped out that damning evidence of broken laws and commandments which always hung over our heads and it's completely a noted by nailing it over his own head to the cross\nAnd then having drawn this thing of all the powers ranged against us you expose them shattered empty and defeated in his final glorious triumphant act and that of course was the resurrection\nYou have a sense of personal inadequacy is there the knowing feeling at your soul that you on to everything that you should be\nAre you constantly irritated by your business associates your friends members have your family or you bothered by temptations of one kind or another that keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them\nI Can't promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified will solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence\nMaking the cross of Christ your own will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you it will give got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty wonderful\nConsidering what God has got to work with in the case of most of us\nIt's pretty wonderful all around a godsend his son and that he died to bring us back to God\nBecause the glory and the wonder of it which causes St Paul to say to all of us Christ did not send me to see how many I could baptize but to proclaim that gospel and I have not done this by the persuasive ... of clever words for I have no desire to Rob the cross of its power\nThe preaching of the cross is I Know nonsense to those who are involved in this dying world\nBut to wash who are being saved from that debt it is nothing less than the power of God it is written I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... the prudent will I reject what consider what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world their show for all of their wisdom\nHas not gone made the wisdom of this world look foolish\nFor it was after the world in its wisdom had failed to no God that he and his wisdom chose to save all who wouldn't believe by the simple mindedness of the gospel message\nFor the Jews ask for me reckless proofs and the Greeks and intellectual panacea but all we preach is Christ crucified stumbling block to the Jews and share nonsense to the ... but for those who are cold weather Jews are gentile is\nChrist the power of God and the wisdom of God amen [noise]\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology I'm joined here in the studio by Dr Cooney cook director of us ministries or at least for an hour ministries\nThe rapid pace of technology is not slowed it all has it\nI remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm on the middle of a cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started they started to you know can multiply their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had this thought that will I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need them [laughter] and now today you know how it's going to permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and it also\nBrings questions of of morality and and usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut um no someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die\nReally yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a face of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that say no no no this is the right point no this is the right point or my way as and here's the proof for this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith and thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day":
