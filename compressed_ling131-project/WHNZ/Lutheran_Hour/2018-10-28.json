[noise] downloading [noise]\nGave CBS News on the hour sponsored by Sarah works relief\nWhen others' minds which fantasize about their upcoming day said the voice or even tried to grip on to the final moments of their dreams Harold just counted brush strokes\nHarold answered All right who just said federal just counted brush strokes\nAnd how do you know I'm counting brush strokes that's a scene from the two thousand six movies stranger than fiction will Farrell plays Harold Crick and I are as agent coming to grips with the fact that he has an author\nHow would you feel to be in Harold position\nWhat would it be like to have an omniscient um knee presence on the potent narrator writing you into existence not because you'd justified yourself by what you could do but only because your author wish for you to be a part of the story\nWhat is the only reason for your life was the free and gracious choice of your author in other words what would it mean to be justified by grace alone\nThis week marks the five hundred and first anniversary of the day Martin Luther among can professor from the University of whittenberg and Germany posted is Ninety five feces\nNow before we go any further I Want to make sure everyone listening knows the Lutheran password you identify yourself as a Lutheran you might not realize that we have a password so here it is justification by grace through face\nSo what does it mean\nSometimes we lose friends we treated like a password code or magical formula and we've repeated to prove that we're real Lutherans but what does it mean\nHere's what it means I'm not God and you're not God God is God God\nIs God with us or it without us but God became dodge for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nBack to the first part I'm not God you're not God God is God\nA couple of months before he posted his famous Ninety five feces on October thirty first Fifteen Seventeen Martin Luther wrote the following\nMan is by nature and able to want God to be God indeed he himself wants to be gotten does not want God to be God I think\nThe possibility of being in something like Harold trick situation is very disturbing for us smartphone toting self defining early twenty first century individuals'\nSee we've been told to write our own stories and so it's strange to imagine that we might have an author\nIt's a strange thing letting God be God it's a strange thing being justified by grace alone grace alone was the phrase the first Lutheran Protestant Reformers used to describe the one way relationship between God in God's creatures\nGod gives creatures receive\nPassively like characters in a story\nThe Bible describes God is the author of the story of the world so we can think of the world the universe and everything that happens in it as one great long story with all of us as characters in it then we must think of God as the author of the story\nThis means that God is the creator but not merely like a designer and author does more than design\nFor example my smartphone had a designer but that person hasn't touched this machine a long long time if ever the majority of of this creations lifespan is spent far removed from its design or not so with an author as long as the stories being told the author never leaves\nThe authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings in terms of plot\nAnd author is a creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are creators of father begets and a mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way only smaller mom and dad smile baby smiles back\nThey ask questions soon she answers there's give and take\nA two way relationship in contrast the author character relationship only goes one way the author exist on an entirely different level for example\nHarry Potter Ronald ... her money Granger they don't have access to JK Rowling they're not even real in the same way that JK Rowling Israel\nThere author makes them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first it's a one way relationship\nHere saw the Bible says it who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor\nOr was given a gift to God that God should repay him for from him and threw him meant to him are all things to him be the glory into the age of the ages\nRomans eleven thirty four thirty six here's how job set it in God's hands is the life of every living thing in the breath of all mankind if God tears down ... can rebuild\nIf God shut the man in non can open\nIf gosh you gather to himself his spirit and his breath all flesh would perish together and man would return to dust\nJob twelve and thirty four job's belief\nThat God is the author of all things is the foreign at the throbbing source of his anguish if we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we hear him go on to say God has torn me in his wrath\nGod gives me up to the ungodly cast me into the hands of the wicked\nWhy do the which it live and prosper why are not tons of justice ... by the almighty\nJob sixteen Twenty one and twenty four imagined being trapped in a story like that at a turning point in the story of Harold Crick\nAgain here's here's author alluding to his past interpreting his present foreshadowing his future Tyne is tied here's the voice again\nIt was remarkable\nHow the simple modest elements of Harold life so often taken for granted would become the catalyst for an entirely new life\nBy the end of day\nHarold had enough again he hears that voice in his head Harold suddenly found himself beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nShut up cursing the heavens and utility no I'm not encouraging you you stupid boy so shut up and leave me alone\nEven if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story that doesn't stop you from trying\nYou rebel against your author now that you realize these here that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him resisting the movement of the story trends pressing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggled the more you only hurting yourself the more you fight him the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him one day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nUnit versus a an accident of on guided evolution from the idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending I Am the author of my story\nIt's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living and so it goes you know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away\nIt gets worse now you and I have\nTo bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is on avoidable cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provokes him\nAnd so on this particular Wednesday evening is Harold waited for the bus his watch suddenly stopped the U.S Harold watch trust him into the mythical path of fate little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Lutheran Hour", "city": "Tampa", "day": "28"}
