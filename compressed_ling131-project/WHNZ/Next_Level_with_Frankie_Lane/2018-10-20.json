{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "And we are a nonprofit that has\nDecided to help raise funds through hundreds like children across borders to help\nFill in the gaps you know we all know that um again not to get political but there's never seems to be enough money especially for our youth and the state so we do our best to try to fill in those gaps and\nFor us we have for programs um to help subside you know to fill in those gaps with them and I think my favorite is our children's needs program and I think one thing that people don't understand about children in foster care is that\nThey're they're through no fault of their own though you know they they didn't do anything wrong they were found in a very unsafe environment and removed for their safety\nIf somehow it's as if we're punishing them because we have to move them to a foster care um facility or to foster parent or to a relative and and we try our best to get them what they need 'em but they know they're different they know when they go to school that they are not like their peers and so we try with our children's needs\nTo fill in the gaps so um I was a young man right now he's Seventeen he knows he's not going to be adopted um he's graduated high school early completed his GED he's working at a fast food restaurant and\nWe were just able to buy him a laptop because he just an ... see and this is a young man who has been um [noise]\nA part of the foster care program for about six years and\nThe guardian ad litem who is the uh volunteer child out of the cat it's been assigned to his case that we work with sent me a picture and she said I I have never seen him smile is way and you know you're just kind of give those kids a little bit of\nWhat loving parents try to provide and it can be summer camp that can be a new uniform because they've made the football team that could be tutoring sessions some of these kids go on to college or some of them are put up for adoption some of them are reunited with a parent that knows\nThat they were in a bad relationship and they go through a case planned to make it better\nThe guardian ad litem program itself is made up of these wonderful volunteer taught advocates there is a staff of about Seventy people here in Hillsborough County and then about seven hundred of these volunteers and when a child's case comes through um\nThe court system a judge will assign a volunteer guardian ad litem to their case\nThat volunteer becomes it's not a mentor and it's not even a parent but it's just they become the voice of that child and they're able to talk to teachers and guidance councilors and and other family members and they're not on the side of the parent they're not on the side of\nThe parents families and I'm kind of he said she said of what goes on in life\nBut they're they are to find out what the child what is best for the child and they and they fight for it\nAnd sometimes these cases can take as much as four years of time and these volunteers are amazing and they give their time every month to make sure the child is safe and then if the child needs extra things they contact us and we help\nAs well the guardian ad litem office there is that a team of attorneys that are amazing\nAnd so we were actually we're the only non profit um that funds a guardian ad litem program in the state of Florida to be able to\nPay for things for that legal team you know sometimes we think about these cases and they go to court and you think well to the child should have the best representation possible and I was also and I believe that the lawyers do but they don't have the funds to possibly get that expert testimony or a psychological evaluation of the parents to make sure that they're in a stable\nEnvironment um and so we try to fund those items and and sometimes it's surveillance sometimes at paying for depositions\nLittle things like that all adds up and so we try to support that legal team as much as we can so that they can make an a decision and the best interest of the child\nAlong the way like I said we try to keep the children out of the court room I'm the guardian ad litem volunteers their child advocate will go into the courtroom for them so that they aren't there we don't want them to be re introduced to their parents or offending party\nAnd um but there's times when the child has to retell the story and when that happens we have for as their first courthouse facility dog I'm named Tibet who is a beautiful golden retriever lab mix and she and her handler ...\nWho is a full time volunteer um travel between the courthouse and another facility called ... house and they sit with those children and and the children have to share their story\nOr Tibet sits and lifts and the child recounts and is able to be um smuggled we call them come hug [laughter] with a pop but um you know to that one of the one of the most magical things for me is\nUm if any of you and your life have a six year old child you know that it's not really easy to have a six year old sit for an extended period of time um but there was a six year old child who needed to tell a story and as\nA the story was being told Tibet sat on the floor and\nThe child massage Tibet ear kind of rolling the ear over and over and her little hand I'm\nSharing what happened for three hours while in the first three hours and I would have been really difficult with algebra sitting there\nAnd just as it is just kinda got into her um frame of mind and she was peaceful and she was able to share everything and and the people were able to ask questions and\n[noise] and that is that's the gift it's a special gift and um we partner with a great organization or a land do called a companion stuck canine companions for independence and this dog is purpose bred for this so different than a therapy animal um Tibet is\nThat you know she really can set and and be pat and loved and and it's evidence on on the floor you always we call them Tibet sprinklers and they'll see just a little\nPilots [laughter] after all the loving and um\nSo we're very proud to have that program as well and I think the last thing that we do and we try to support as much as we can\nIs the recruitment at these volunteer child out of the cats and we need more of them you know we have seven hundred and we have over thirty three hundred children and they have some case where some at some guardian ad litem volunteers that\nHave as many as eight children that they are trying to help a lot yeah that's a lot [laughter] it's a big ... you know some of these children maybe from a family unit ah siblings but they may not be placed together and so it it's a it's a calling I think that if you are an individual who feels like\nYou um are passionate about children and about the rights of children and that you are not intimidated to share your voice in your opinion and and go into a courtroom and share your story which I think any of that you have a\nA young person in your life you automatically become passionate about them you know and it's so it's it's easy to get caught up in a story to make sure that they're safe because that's what we want to just a safe permanent and letting home and at the end of the day I'm\nAs a volunteer guardian ad litem if you're able to help that child down that path\nYou know ... it's very rewarding experience I'm not going to say it's always magical sometimes there are things that happen um but you just you the best you can\nHave you seen a renewed interest in the program since we've had some high profile cases in the area that have brought the foster care system into into the news or have you seen more people interested in ah helping out in that way\nWe do in fact you can go on the guardian ad litem website and sign up for information session and we suggest that anyone that's interesting do that first and we are finding that we are filling the seats\nThirty people at a time where maybe it was Fifteen people at a time I'm were also finding that you know I think some people think that volunteer work is just for those that maybe are retired\nUm maybe even a stay at home mom and the kids are at school and his hours\nBut that's not the case of guardian ad litem a it's a whole range of professions a whole range of individuals\nUm I'll do my special clog we need more men or men out there\nThat doesn't matter if you are working full time job should CEO of a corporation if you have ten hours and\nThey're manufactured in one of only a handful of pharmaceuticals license facilities right out in Norway they make the best fish oil in the world Ninety percent concentrations\nCompletely pure know mercury issues no fish tastes no fish ... nothing like that\nJust the

role because we feel we have the best product and now the best product combinations that deliver even better benefits for people\nWe're talking with Jesus in camp resident upon of development of

to be given up that phone number ... ... and let's get to ingredient number two because there's so many got three super bill does something that no other visual product can do it actually lowers cholesterol\nTalk about these plants ... explain how this works and why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who is in concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one\nCompound one ingredient that stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown\nTo significantly lower\nLDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol right and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in as little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level safely\nAnd naturally absolutely no side effects\nVery effective they've known about plants they're off since the Nineteen fifties and they work it would be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to Staten Staten work by preventing the\nProduction of cholesterol in the liver\nPlants that rolls block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines plants their rules are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically confuse little cells in your intestine called\nMy feels into thinking that the plants they're all\nAre actually the cholesterol particles so that might steals\nPick up the plan sterile instead of the cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles instead just get passed through your intestine the point is if you're on that and you can take plants they're off as an a dent in therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits\nAnd of course this particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants they're all to deliver the benefits as shown in the studies that something that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that were all on the label\nMay only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for\nPurity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow Jason let's talk about the third
