our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nDo you remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging and even longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was there a troll yes ... the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nAnd our guest today says that's just half\nThe story so here with the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce them for over Twenty years Dr precedent is the institution of New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show he holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a long time product formulated and high level advisor for purity products that they are pressing\nWelcome aboard mark ... speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them as ... nominate on those people out there who just vaguely familiar with this story what exactly is was very ... and why is it all over the news today\nFirst of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty health journals a weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically reservoir troll as what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found and peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about ... is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation and the scientists really first became interested in resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when ... first isolated from red wine it\nWas also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well and this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six tatty and scientists discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and here's what really got them interested a Harvard researcher David Sinclair\nReporter that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice by thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seemed to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal ... activity in the body it improved indoor ends\nThere was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved endure and storing aerobic activity\nAnd it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough caloric restriction your body feels threatened this switches on what they call the longevity gene in your body it switches on a sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a cellular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's dictate\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking ... pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purely products for several years on their co Q. formulas with your co enzyme Q. ten which is just as important as Missouri's role especially your heart healthy and uses in some ways it's got even more evidence so let me ask you this who needs you know what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what our co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful antibiotics and and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell wins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten in your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten\nYou're living in what we call an energy deficient stay your heart and he's co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right in your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we need all of this energy\nThat case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential well", "show_name": "Next
