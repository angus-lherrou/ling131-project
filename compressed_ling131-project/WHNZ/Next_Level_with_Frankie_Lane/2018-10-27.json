R. P. dot com has a website where you can find out more and of course when you go there you'll you'll see all the information on stop soldier suicide as well keep let me talk to you a little bit about the resources and pardoned organizations that you teamed up with the help of veterans and their families and talk a little bit about that\nShirt so we have a database that has a more than three thousand individual resources whether or the national level or a locally and so you know our case managers are are proficient in and how to manage that database and then how do\nYou know do independent research to make sure that that we're providing our\nOur clients with what they need so we may have a client that you know that we can't serve through resources in our database\nThat you know we don't we don't in there you know we'll\nGet on the Internet call locally figure out you know what maybe in that um you know that veterans community that we can uh hooked him up with and then\nWe actually individually vet each of the resources even if they're in our database before we provide them to the quiet in other words we want to make sure that that if it's a local provider that there are still you know have the um\nUh have the financial ability or or the individual resources to be able to help our quiet\nSo we want to make sure that we're providing them with a youthful link and then you know after after we go through that process and make sure that we provided provided them with a high quality resource we call back within the week to make sure that\nYou know that's actually proved to be useful for them and then if not uh we go back to the drawing board until we get whatever it is that that client needs\nAnd and we talked a lot about obviously a PBS the therapy or suicide prevention but you guys do even more than that I mean everything from you know emergency financial aid housing assistance things like that uh so do you really try to to meet whatever need is out there\n[noise] Oh absolutely I mean you know this is this is driven by the needs of the clients not what a you know we we think the client needs um you know that said out of the you know Thirteen hundred and fifty six um clients that we've had about\nThe more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically used pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... flew it\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so\nIt's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule pat it's big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down\nSo that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at a laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but we prove that it's orally absorbed\nAnd more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as we think of it\nNow bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough and what exactly can do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water\nAnd as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of ourselves\nBegins to lose its water it separates out and then we begin to lose\nThe substance the scaffolding the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we didn't get into a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and of course the fountain of youth the water and of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloon filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies but as age goes on we're going to lose it\nWe're going to see the wrinkles that thinning hair we're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue costs ... sulfate is a regular dietary supplement non drug stores health food stores people ask me well why hasn't my doctor told me about highly ironic gas it well it took Thirteen Years for all the costs of me it'll be on the front page of time magazine it's just going to take time\nAnd it'll get there because patients are going to take this through the doctors and pointed out as they did glue costs I mean the revolution starts with patients\nNow you've written a great deal about the role of highly want a gas it in the bodies connective tissue how does each a work in the joints and the connective tissue\nIt's a natural cushioning agent and pat we're talking to about between the bones it also surrounds the nerves there's a sigh addict nerve there's an owner nerve there's a carpal tunnel nerve\nAll of these are going to need a special cushioning that ha can give them there are people that tell us this stuff works here's Ernie writing to me who's actually teaches and plays golf in Dover, Delaware he found this purity joint formula and were telling you\nIt work miracles for him why\nBecause purity is not only taken the ha but they've taken a brand new substance called Hydrox that's taken from olives now pat you notice you can put a bowl of olives on your table and a year later come back\nAnd except for a little bit of a shrinkage due to just the loss of moisture they're very stable they're still there they didn't shrivel up and waste away due to fungal contamination so there's something very strong and all is we've known it for a long time\nDr Roberta Korea an Italian researchers now here in this country doing some research on hide Roxy tier is all\nExtracted from olives and found out that it does some of the same things that the molecules to that trigger like estrogen does the production of ha so we began to think why don't we combine this wonderful strong antioxidant from olives\nInto ... new ha joined for a meal you know we're getting results like we've never seen before this is why bill of rights to us\nThis year saying I'm taking ha from my knees it's done wonders for my joints so\nWe get these letters from people there unsolicited\nThey just can't believe it here's someone writing to me this is a Dr Kelly saying\nHe looks like a man that's Thirty years younger and he says people can't even believe his level of fitness and youthful appearance and he says I tell you to tell them it's just the H a formula now this stuff works fairly quick much faster than glue costs I mean and it's all\nSafe all natural its purity age a joint formula and pat most of the people who write to me or call me\nOr not people who regularly fall for you

pillows welcome once again to help line by your brothers your host marks the most so glad you\nJoined us today is a power pack program in fact our story originally Fifteen Years ago when the renowned TV show sixty minutes captivated audiences around North America with a special segment of the French paradox\nYou remember the French paradox this is the counter intuitive concept that says\nRed wine actually promotes our cardiovascular health and vitality scientists were intrigued well fast forward ten years Harvard researchers in Boston test over thirty thousand compounds searching for the one the best activates genes that control our weight or energy healthy aging you needed longevity\nThe holy grail of medical research and what did they find out of thirty thousand compounds tested the single best gene activated was was there a troll ... all the active ingredient found in that's right red wine five years later ... is one of the hottest breakthroughs in the field of healthy aging\nOur guest today says that's just half\nThe story so here in the rest of the story Dr Alan ... let me introduce for over Twenty years Dr precedent is the institution of New York radio host in his own highly successful health radio show\nHe holds a PHD in clinical nutrition he's been a longtime product formulated and high level advisor for purity products jak your freshman welcome aboard\nMark always great speaking to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's touch them as long as we're as we're also nominate those people out there who just to vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is ... ... why is it all over the news today well first of\nAll it sure is all over the news especially the Health News you know I read about twenty health journals a week and every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically reservoir troll is what we call a poly feeding all it's found in red wine that's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries it's even found in peanuts\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBy plants themselves to protect themselves against any kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation\nAnd the scientists really first became interested in resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when ... first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got although scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish well anything that extends the life of anything is going to get the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well\nBy two thousand six Italian scientist discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand sex and here's what really got them interested\nA Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported that resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet and mice by thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seemed to protect the intestines and the colon definitely supported normal and cinematic activity in the body it improved indoor and\nIt was even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved indoor and storing aerobic activity\nAnd it even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school to New York I was just reading at an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they call the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that gets on a secular level but apple ism changes\nYour ability to adapt and coke dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this switched on by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's dictate\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard and this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWow this is amazing but let me just step back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their co Q. formulas but now that feature co enzyme Q. ten would you say is just as important as reservists role especially your heart healthy and you'll see in some ways it's got even more evidence behind it so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten ... what exactly is good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what our co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell co Q. ten is the new trend that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart your liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy wow that's amazing\nYeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's a while ago well I was teaching for the first time physiology and nutrition and I remember speaking about co Q. ten at that point\nAnd at that point it had only been discovered six years before Nineteen fifty seven at the University of Wisconsin where they were looking for what makes the heartbeat well they found out that was co Q. ten\nAnd that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell went south a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten you're living in what we call an energy deficient state your heart and he's co Q. ten in fact the highest concentration of ...\n... in your body is right in your heart muscle your brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system", "show_name": "Next Level with Frankie Lane", "year": "2018",
