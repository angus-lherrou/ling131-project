{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "But what I Am saying is is probably time to look at your portfolio rethink what you're doing and in the last segment I made a comment because we are talking about meeting with our clients and how we help them and I made a statement that happiness\nIs having a steady paycheck right this is as being able to know that your money is going to be there when you need to know that you'll never run out yeah my my mother used to say\nI'm afraid I'm going to live to log now she's still here doing great but she's a phrase you in a way too long she was never afraid of living a long time what that means that she was afraid of outliving her money right I'm afraid of living too long\nThis is the number one concern for people so as you go through this all the time the number one thing you want to do is think about protecting some of your money is not the time to take everything you have it and go you know pedal to the metal in the stock market it it was that time before\nIt's not that time now what I'm seeing taught unfortunately is we went to CPR program will have a lot of callers from the show which is wonderful I Love meeting people I Love city with people and I like talking about finances of financial geek I think\nBut would that being said what I'm seeing with almost everyone that comes with the door is your portfolios are invested in my opinion\nTypically in the wrong places that you could be doing either much better or how much less risk or overall uh there's so much room for improvement\nAnd I'm telling you I mean people coming and they've been with the visor Fifteen Twenty years I mean people that come in to manage your own money they've been doing it for Twenty years himself smart people\nA room for improvement there's always room for improvement don't close your eyes and think that I'm okay and then we go through another two thousand eight and you're sorry\nYou know let me equate this to physical exercise\nIf you have the same route to ... all the time if if you if you talk to a doctor's if you talk to a physical therapist a ... a trainers\nI you know they'll tell you that you you need to mix up your exercises alley you don't want to do the same thing constantly and I think the same thing goes for finance is that what if you're just in the same\nTrajectory this same rut then you're on that same hamster wheel yeah over a long period of time well what if what if you're in on the wrong hamster wheel\nWell even more importantly what I'm seeing you know we adjust portfolio we stay up with things we we're one of the few independent firms actually have the\nUh the financial managers internal in house with us it saves our clients money it allows us to make good decisions in a timely manner it's a right way to do things what I'm seeing is people are investing with your professional advisors in the wrong places I mean places they have so much risk\nYou know you look at the world you got the United states you've got international you've got emerging markets you've got real estate you got technology you have all these places you go to the best ... some of those are good\nAnd some of those are bad and what most financial advisors do Todd is they put a little bit everywhere\nThat's not healthy why would you invest in something you expect to go down\nYou know you know I expect them all to go up right what we can do is sit together look at your portfolio and say well look this was good to hear but maybe you need an improvement there or\nA risk is a big deal with the I Know my my goal was that you get your destination is safe way as possible and and maybe just maybe you're not doing that and and what we sat together for a few minutes\nAnd we had a nice meeting and I was able to show you how to maybe find a safer way to accomplish their goals is that worth an hour of your time\nYou know so so it is important to come in it's important to have the right balance in life and you're right if you exercise the same muscle over and over a year not healthy that doesn't make you healthy is to balance it makes you healthy that's what we can show you how to do and we could show you how to do it\nIn a challenging market like this\nI think much safer than what you're doing I say a thing because I was in your portfolio we haven't met yet\nBut but I I bet you that we can teach you some things that are ... gonna make you do better and that's the most important thing about CPR is the ability to come in and improve because we spend time together\nIs a simple process a lot of people are I I use that hamster wheel in the same exercise regimen and\nThey haven't made adjustments and the fact is is that\nGood investing requires active eyes and I love the fact Bob that you know your team your analyst there in the house it you're not you're not relying on others of course you draw from ... in look at opinions and you look at strategies across the board but your core team\nIs internal it's right in the Harwood officers right here in the Tampa Bay area\nAnd that's important I mean that is really essential that they're not satisfying some big
