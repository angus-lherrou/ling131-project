context you think about why because for folks on the left there just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not your ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be impeached but who he would never be reelected I mean people already seen the mistake to me like you you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at what it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again I mean yes you can have new\nVoters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you can move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working on for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and from info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yes a Ford did break for\nDonald Trump beyond that\nSince the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida for the past few years we have\nFifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote\nOh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of register to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people go out registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology last hour\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised\nThat part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and ... is a lot a lot to feel good about first\n... you you take a look at the economy\nWe have the best academy in a generation I never voted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck the hero bomb and they go well I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you've got some mines that are up and\nThat's the God of me in the generation\nBut we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record low unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men yeah remember how it's all about the white men white men\nAnd Asian man the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment right out oh by the way but you also have the biggest increase in take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left\nAlways happy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there it is a little math and it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it pays about two point eight percent base salary year over year okay All right\nThen you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when you do that that gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated suicides histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I I haven't seen a benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not saying that it will be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean old that progress that I decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that and two years answer is if anything he probably has attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets re elected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in\nSo if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected in twenty twenty but here's the the next point\nAnd this is the under stated point I'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism\nThing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it now you take a look at not having that problem\nTake a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically oh these are angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration and guess what\nDoes it make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea and the fact that to date we believe cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is has been dealt with about as\nPeacefully and with as little damage to the United states in our interest as we could have hoped for the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the

serious\nOf ah not Benjamin Button but the ... who has gone missing two weeks ago today and at this point\nIt's rather obvious that we've heard the rumors that have come out of Saudi Arabia or the other day I mean like we are the crazy thing yeah there's a little interrogation and you know I mean that it would just I just really\nYou hate it when when we accidentally kill them I I'm Sorry sorry we won't do it again really\nThat apparently is what we're eventually going to get or at least that's the rumor of what we're going to get out of Saudi Arabia while also having the assertion that hey decaying this young and and hip king who's a white man could draw right now I mean come on\nI mean is and he like yeah when they get drive\nSo did that guy he doesn't know anything and and he's not supposed to do anything\nSo that's where we we are in this process\nBy the by the way the president was even talking about that today he said that for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia but he also said that he spoke with the gang and hey he denies everything denies ... everything so this is difficult this is difficult for a lot of reasons\nWe don't know the exact truth obviously\nAnd you have a lot of folks who say yeah you know wage shoot sanctions bring it on I mean let's just whatever it was Saudi Arabia the first thing is one be thankful that we're very close very close\nTo energy independence of this country by the way did he know that we are now\nThe world's largest producer of oil\nAnd not Saudi Arabia\nRussia us us had a great we're actually pays them to get there in January we got there a little bit earlier it's also good about now because if Saudi Arabia and the influence they had 'em in a pack a day decided hey you know\nWe don't like you putting pressure on us and they go ahead and dramatically reduce production you could see spike in prices obviously that could hurt the economy boom he's you know what happens there so that's one thing we got to consider and this entire process but the bigger one again as you do have this new younger hip king in Saudi Arabia\nWho is like yeah women can can drive now I mean look how progressive I Am in in equal rights and all that\nHe's on board with us against Iran and with Israel and where are you can get that in the middle east you take it for sure that is what complicates this deal but the problem still is mentioned Israel law it's evil wherever it's it's ... there's nothing good about it\nOne thousand five hundred and eighty nine Islamic terror attacks around the world so far this year\nWe've had Ninety four hundred and eighty three people killed in additional Ninety six hundred injured oh by the way so Islamic terrorists still alive and well Israel law and the folks that governed under it still sponsor terrorism and the least of which is ... Iran\nBut here's the problem the dirty little secret about trio law in Islam in governments predominantly in the middle east\nThere are still over forty of them they carry the tenants of sharia\nIncluding by the way Saudi Arabia now we haven't necessarily had a long track record to see how long that's going to remain part of their government but the bigger problem is if you're on board with shrimp your moral compass really sucks and if you were saying that you can like ah you know kill people at will because I don't know\nThere are a woman and they were raped or you're homosexual what else are you willing to do like the journalists thing for example so that's where this becomes the tangled Web\nAnd so it's it's easy to quarterback to say it's much different to to be

him\nMajor sanctioned the hell out of\nThe old ... and Lindsey Graham\nAnyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous that is what makes me not just the the idea section the hell out of okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia says you know what\nWe're kind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know\nAs as cordial as we had previously what happens to them\nAnd what happens if they say you know what\nWe're just going to go ahead and turn off this big to do back in the what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something or to wrecked the economy a little bit there for you all Presidents Day ... things that that could happen any number of different implications so I think it's easy for Lindsey Graham who's out there and loving every\nMaybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feels that ... is kinda fascinating if you think about it and I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like oh\nOut I maybe said

friend who uh is mysteriously well where exactly\n... ... ... talking let's go to Aaron in Kansas Erin go\nOh just a quick question if the king denies any knowledge of it or not it was a body it's obviously is not in the consulate anymore give us a body this poor guys in a hole somewhere still being tortured\nYou know it's an interesting thought a if you're going to be really I I don't know a ... if you're going to engage in a war game I mean I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria scenarios that at least of which would be well maybe when you how the Saudi officials leave\nThe consulate they let them\nYou know if you are there any number of things that can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because well you have many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for that point so\nOf all the scenarios that two weeks later he's still there being tortured I think would be among be least likely\nWhat a lizard with Warren is the Cherokee Indians\nWant to hold oh by the way small details\nI'll get there I ... I couldn't help by itself but to put together some information on Taylor Swift and on the race that she endorsed and her\nClear lack of understanding of any of it when I ended up ... and this was the headline I Believe it was on Sunday on CNBC ... Taylor Swift political adores men could become the biggest red\nHave her as the polls [laughter]\nI mean OK okay\nMaybe just maybe not how you thought\nHere's an ex her last week pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking her stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of sweat surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram boats were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen to twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\nOkay now\nGoing to get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently as a couple of days ago we're still my gosh it's happening I think it's quite a down a little bit\nOver the past year or so because I I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going hey I say it was up in Tennessee or\nSee I'm Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrat so Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race\nYou see at the time of the endorsement\n... Republican challenger in this race\nShe was averaging that three point lead\nAnd the three most recent polls in Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead and the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect where is she today\nAnd the three most recent polls in that particular race\nIs now nine points\nSo\nNot exactly what you're probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed\nIn on is negative six percent\nIn a week so I like to say you got two sides to stories in one side the facts but here's the deal\nHe got a lot of folks that are ... million or the concept that for every action the equal and opposite reaction ... guy on earlier in the show\nThe south in particular\nYou have a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are away and then and specifically when she ended up outing herself\nOr her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nState if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons\nAmong others now she said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values\nBut you say here is that the the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania\n\nAnd she happened only moved to Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there less than half her life you know him the Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the person\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas that one now\nShe spoke of supporting L G Beatty writes\nGB T rights as part of her Tennessee values by the way [noise] [noise] I guess what\nThe Democrats the she endorsed bill bread and said\nHe doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much\nSo it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in\nYou got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville better yeah\nBut here's the thing\nAnybody noticed\nYou got Taylor Swift\nEndorsing an old white guy\nDoes not support\nMarriage and host of other old G Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bad evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa interesting\nI mean and there's a lot more we we can\nContinue down that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those in Tennessee they pretty much get the point to and you'll look you look\nIn terms of tendency values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't as the ... I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements worked right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm by the way it wasn't an awkward moment\nI mean I did the trick always does and so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see if she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nL. J. B.

there you can feel the love ... ... why wouldn't you want to be part of that by the way it's oh I'm Sorry oh let's go to Joe in Jersey Joe go\nHey Brian how are you oh good for a while I was waiting for you I just thought of something an extension to what I Want to talk about with what you were just pushing on but um\nThis is Taylor Swift thing could be even a larger on a larger scale where people are just rejecting a Hollywood talking heads as being any body of any value or lack of value whatsoever that's number one\nNumber two I don't know if you recall but on the night of nine eleven you remember they had that music vigil of ... a vigil with Springsteen and Tom Petty where they were pounding the war drums you recall that\nNot really to be honest with you\nThey all came on and Tom Petty song is we won't back down um it was all a\nIt was all of a kind of aggressive music or that hinted towards we're coming at you but they're the same they were in the same cloth especially Springsteen where they were anti war or it they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping to God that people are just not taking a serious anymore\nI can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities do play if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talk about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one of the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell the first thing is you got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody who's closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try not to the information so when the case of\nCelebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee well you've got a large swath of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse in this is the most offensive thing and I say this I'm not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of dodge meant until I was sixteen that kind of thing didn't come up where where it was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee but you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] name drew many of the folks in Tennessee at those people and so it's kind of like a no offense to you and in in Jersey job but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey not not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\n... states all jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know more conservative area but I I just hope my hoping to God that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities for their political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's why\nI I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is that irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know they just are\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe and Menendez I mean come on really ... you got some work to do with Jersey oh let's go to a liberal in in ah Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota hey ...\nTo a that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right so if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificant way on your tax return and it should save every body that is an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you all\nA little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee and we have a lot of employees we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of them ... you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant opposition an attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you in this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting their strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there in big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with a ... team they loved to help people they love to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide left the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls is what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine and just say\nI Love to come in and meet the Harwood team and get that second opinion on your portfolio\nBump let's also dive into\nOne of the side how do people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done that said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he listens or radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years is just fine with you I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be you said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need is that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving enough you don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my job is to make you more financially successful they are today right isn't that simple\nAnd when you call for your CPR you're pointing review with me you want to sit down with me and and meet and just talk a little bit and warned for me I'm going to show you how to get your find the answers on track\nAnd if you're on track I'll show you how to make them better and you're going to be better off because of the time was spent together so if you have a cold and if you're one of those listeners haven't called in yet or or you just feel like you want to do better with your finances you're not doing good enough\nGive me a call it's eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine and say hey I listen to Robert I listen to you for a long time and I just want to come in for a review a ass were copied the book when you call will send you a copy of the book as well but what sit together\nRobert we only have less than a minute left\nAnd less I've known him for a long time we've been personal friends before we ever put this radio show together you built an amazing financial practice and I just can't implore people enough\nTo call your office make the appointment it doesn't cost a penny there's no obligation no one's gonna bug you but for people to come in and just bring in their current investment strategy their current portfolio and just let you look it over and give them a second opinion\nFolks you you're leaving valuable information and a potentially a whole lot of money on the table by not taking Robert Harward up on the offer folks\nIt as a simple phone call eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine say I love the appointment first callers get the free book investing for retirement best selling on Amazon that Robert ... wrote\nFirst ten callers eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine get the book\nAnd also make the appointment eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine and we'll see you next time [noise]\nTo find out more about financial advisor Robert Harward and the heart would weigh call Harwood financial at one eight hundred three nice five\nFour to seven one eight hundred three nine five four to seven night for online at the Harwood way dot com [noise]\n\n\nProceeding\nWas a commercial program paid for by Harwood financial the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceedings program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporate in\nWest horse helpful\nTerrible those responsible I imagine it will be held to account but it happen in a consulate which as you and I know that Saudi Arabian territory so this it appears the Saudi Arabians\nKilled a Saudi Arabian on Saudi Arabian territory then probably took ... body away in a van or put at NASA or something this is terrible\nIt's awful kind of like when Kate Steinle was gunned down by some of the wailing but for the last week or ten days the media is in overdrive the blame Trump\nOr Jared Kushner or some relationship there saying somehow we did it that were responsible that Trump somehow with ah with um Mohammed bin Salman so called M B. S. that MPs is somehow\nConsulting with Trump to decide what to do ahead of time which is a bunch of crap\nNobody's in favor of this we have a western mine\nAre Judeo Christian ethic we believe and due process at least Republicans do so we believe in fairness and and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian bought a Saudi Arabian government in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting\nBut hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times and the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor kick him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident innocent ... offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out\nI guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful and so can we move on from that\nThe answer of course is no this is the uh the event there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a\nBunch of other incidents that have arisen the past several months to Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen as possible\nBut it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours Wolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch ... MPs is on speed dial with coach dinner and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who thinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country and that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Ron man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that\nAnd so because Saudi Arabia is the pitch enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and weaken Saudi Arabia and the middle east so that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough\nMaybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThey're the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas\nSo there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding friendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that and we're hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars a of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we helped get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happen happen it occurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis\nCountries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal could show gig and stupidly they decide to pick\nA consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks the sides you know what I say have at it [noise]\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ...\nAnd so things were heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and or Montana the president is going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp did lousy thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims so the red wave appears to be building and the Senate\nAnd that was the big news story so the last several days the news media say wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can have that so they started this other thing about Jamal ...\nWho was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen ... illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage the MS Thirteen\nWith the girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction\nAnd his Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction if we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's gonna happen in the house I have no idea\nSo let's continue with more\nThan ... line becomes available which it never does\nEight seven seven three eight one three eight one one eight seven seven three eight one three one one and ... and we'll ... we'll be back with you on Mondays dealing with a family member who's quite ... he'll be back on Monday so let's continue with more\nThey'll counting and

confirming every plus I our radio in Sanders data message rates apply in this nation wide contests that day to two hundred two hundred [noise] calm\n[noise]\nOnly other one for you can go with seven seven breed one ... one one [noise]\nI've only counting of the great American in for the great when Martin live and we have teeth and Chris and Josh and many others to lines are open\nTo you know the ... ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one Leslie before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system is I just told you a Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine nine percent never get U.S Supreme court\nAnd so if in twenty days the Senate flips to the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not confirm any\n... any of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point if Trump is reelected which most of us believe he will do this and that stays democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one and it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you could nominate but they went out confirmed one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights than traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations if the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life Jared Kushner's life everyone's life for the White House will\nBe laid bare and the next two years will not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months\nWhere Republicans are shot run off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable another aspect to courses foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good North Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet\nRight now Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow were the stock market react if Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus you got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who wants to eliminate Trump from office ... so if you went the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about a and only about investigations and impeachments in a hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot\nSo when Trump comes to one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with him on a play some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens I go there just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically and confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets dry like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good and so I\nThink about what's on the ballot and twenty days because the Democrats are as incentivize is they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob by buying them all for paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles and Chris in Atlanta line becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more kids in Los Angeles welcome to the mark Levin show hosted by the

conversations with authority ... and his entourage arranged a kitten that this guy though and if you look and recently um John Brennan the laugh test today and they say he confirmed that through his operatives so I think\nUm yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point\nOut on the on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why why\nWhy do you rely upon al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe al Jazeera out a cutter why do you believe them I wouldn't believe one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but when they're right there at the end up paying for twenty four seven you fail the factual information
