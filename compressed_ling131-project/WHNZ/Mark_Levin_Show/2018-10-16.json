life I really enjoyed\nIt [noise] but there's been a break in that case a real break in the case\nOver the weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case happened a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe has been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nCorruption in our intelligence community or the department of justice and at the upper level management of the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks are here's what happened this week and let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed the story somehow I don't know if you've been out in bars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and it's like that Bruce Willis movie you say with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [noise]\nThe Donald Trump team was spied on by the United states government there were five years of war\nThe issue to spy on the Trump team you may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly a vow exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case my book as extensive foot notes on it even by I use liberal foot notes that way to liberals can't repeat what they said in the past on it but\nThe case is very simple in its essence opposition political party from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case and the FBI the upper levels in their management chain\nTo go after the Trump that's it now\nWhy am I bring that up now not to give you like oh well that's great what else is there are lots to talk about them bringing this up so the break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe\nUnleash the just the port of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News and that at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going not remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at the time a presidential candidate\nThe explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seemed to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole was all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos then as I explained in a ... show which was all about alpha bank\nThat's in my book and lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you\nFolks the reason the story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the old he's kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on\nThey tried the alpha bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos all man up is working out the shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on\nThat was advance by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals parrot this too\nIs now George Papadopoulos that George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information that there you go bingo we got\nAll these gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight as a court there is a verification process for the information is supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this week sometimes a little complicated me ever been a federal agent [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant that I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence and this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on is\nIn fact not the place and I felt it was good evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime ladies and gentlemen the chances of losing your job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nAre significant it's becoming clear as day now\nThat the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of this that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale is made up but the information they presented\nTo the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only the stuff alleged basically in the ... and here say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks\nTheir investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nThought that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars which is what I estimate and that's a really good thing\nYou still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to say\nRetirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee and we have a lot of employees we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of them ... you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant opposition an attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employees of thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there and big debt out there a damn thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advise your questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with a ... team\nThey loved to help people they loved to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide let the Harwood team guide you

money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind yeah not saved enough money you know he was just a radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years is just fine with you I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be you said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or
