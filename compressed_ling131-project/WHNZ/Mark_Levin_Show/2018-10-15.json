{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Before we get into the Roth IRA and if you're not saving enough for a time and how do you know give us just a quick overview on the new crowd Trump tax plan which was approved was signed what do you our listeners need to know about\nThere are investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nGod that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars which\nIs what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of um ... you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they've got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plan unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows but with that big deficit out there and big ...\nIt out there or that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advise your questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money you don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help us unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with the horror with team they loved to help people they loved to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide let the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls as what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine\nAnd just say I'd love to come in and meet the Harwood team and get that second opinion on your portfolio\nBob Let's also dive into\nOne of the ... how do people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what\nIs your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he listens or radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years and says finally I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be you said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need is that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving enough you don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my job is to make you more financially successful they are today right isn't that simple\nAnd when you call for your CPR you're pointing review with me you want

only have less than a minute left and less I've known him for a long time we've been personal friends before we ever put this radio show together you've built an amazing financial practice and I just can't implore\nPeople enough to call your office make the appointments\nIt doesn't cost a penny there is no obligation no one's going to bug you but for people to come in and just bring in their current investment strategy their current portfolio and just let you look it over and give them a second opinion\nFolks you you're leaving valuable information and a potentially a whole lot of money on the table by not taking Robert Harward up on the offer folks\nIt has a simple phone call eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine say I love the appointment first time caller skipped the free book investing for retirement best selling on Amazon that Robert ... wrote\nFirst ten callers eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine get the book\nAnd also make the appointment

hundred three nice five\nFour to seven one eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine for online that's the hard way dot com [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] in\nThe proceeding was a commercial program paid for by Harwood financial the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W H ... am its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporate helpful\nFought our first I our radio after\nThe death of a Saudi journalists are preparing ... met Ron giving\nAnd they are used to doing this and winning because what happens they ask the questions the Republicans panic\nYou know listen there's this tax cuts and wealthy people are going to do well under these types of of course they are they're wealthy they pay a lot of money in taxes of course they're gonna do well under a tax cut that's not the question the question is are middle class Americans working Americans going to do well to what is the economy going to grow\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they haven't been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing framing the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nDoes not accept the premise of the question and turns the question to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think they're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and try to advance\nShe re frames it in his way [noise] perfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is a a\nThis is Trump's narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans this is a that's a that's a almost total logical\nTruck knows that Trump is comfortable\nWith that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames Lesley Stahl who's smart\nShe's listened she's not dumb she's very bright she's just the liberal just liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right [noise] she automatically senses Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times\nAnd when they interviewed Obama they interrupted and four times but we figured that because that's what they do right\nShe get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the way a basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes to battle scars at all that's Trump's ammo he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activist takeaway number one is you re frame the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paid for this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last word he gets the last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nThe benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last then that's what everybody remembers\nStall tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know ... and and that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... of a kind of the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hits hits hard\nThat people are attracted to that authenticity\nSo we understand if he has to reframe it number one and secondly he understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\n[noise] now\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democratic party right now which is a just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely an authentic\nWho they are they based their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren that I\n... I mean who what other president other than Donald Trump what other forget\nAbout president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty or twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks who ever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you say you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nYou want to talk about politics fine I get up in their ... you're talking about there is no middle ground we have to win that's why I keep saying the new rules are in effect in Trump gets it may have to lose and we have to when we need to exercise raw political power\nTo keep these people on the radical left for taking power because they've shown no evidence do handle it responsibly\n... workers later in the show me to talk about new developments on the Spygate thing that broke this week it representative John Ratcliffe gave a explosive interview on Maria brought a robo about ... exculpatory evidence that's probably hanging out there\nBut folks they're not even authentic\nBernie Sanders on the economic front Elizabeth Warren ... with the continued insistence that she's not a Native American you know a bagel with this constant like I'm a skateboard guy look at me look how cool a my skateboard in what a burger parking lot great good well who\nCares why does that matter he's skate boards who cares\nYou're seriously voting for this guy or considering voting for this guy in Texas because he skate boards you understand this guy's a hard left it he want your money he watch your guns he watch your health care\nTaxes\nI I'm actually astonished disguise anywhere close to even forty percent of the vote he's a hard leftist push skate parts Cape parts of so called who cares who gives a damn\nBetty skateboard to know what a burger parking lot what\nA burger Scott good burgers go inside any burger what are your skateboard in the parking lot for this cars they may get run over you don't want that\nGo inside out some friday's sheesh\nAll right this is a ... on the other side of his break I've got some numbers I Want to I Want to get too because this is bothering me too with all all these democratic candidates are twenty twenty or entirely\nAn authentic [noise] I've got some numbers about their so called fair share economics that have been a blow your mind\n... got to pay their fair share of really [noise] ...

without battle scars I'm not suggesting you know anybody here is without sin I'm simply suggesting that one of the messages that resonates with\nThe American people is he's a plane speaking authentic guy who says what's on his mind and after fifty plus years of PC politics and focus group tested nonsense this cells\nNow I bring that up in relationship to the sixty minutes interview where I I thought he just dismantled Leslie stall\nI Know it because I've got friends of mine who were union workers up in New York am I going to say who 'cause honest to God but free there'll be targeted but who texted me during the interview like I Can't believe how great the wiz\nContrast that with the frauds and the Democrat side Elizabeth Warren putting out a press conference press release today that

saw a fascinating piece that I have a lot to cover today but I saw a fascinating piece in Bloomberg of all I'm not a big\nHuge fan of the Web but once in a while they have good articles that economic and Bloomberg of all places talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nItself have let me just say something numbers so much it's the comparisons\nYou'll see what I mean I'm at the top\nOne percent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners pay an astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country\nI think about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes in\nThis country chew on that one for a minute you may say okay\nWell you know that one out of a hundred people it's a top one percent they're very rich folks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent few liberals who have a tough time with\nThis kind of stuff [noise]\nPays only thirty point five percent of the income tax look\nSo pick about this for a second this is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... probably not that rich you don't pay your fair share of you know the ... thing right\nYou don't pay your fair share you know pay your fair share it's not that Trump just doesn't accept that he turns around and just throws it right out of the ... right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts over with a\nYou know what they pay a lot actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] God job the top\nOne percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load\nThan the bottom Ninety what the hell's a fair share if that's not what a ...\nThere's more by this isn't just that there's more of these comparisons in this this is sort of Bloomberg peace again not a some right wing website here\nI mean his son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberals listening it'd be like no you got that from uh some right wing slanted Web site there that was just trying to manipulate the fact this is from ... okay\nThe top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent of income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is is so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some\nAs John Kerry doctors boat in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes would have yet Al Sharpton at his tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in the country [noise]\n\nTell me again please with a straight face with a straight face how they're not paying their fair share\nFourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or as the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even though these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax law as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely you read it for the rich no no no no no no I made it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair\nShare is fair shall we used to be able to make this doping stupid talking boy it rich don't pay their fair share they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you
