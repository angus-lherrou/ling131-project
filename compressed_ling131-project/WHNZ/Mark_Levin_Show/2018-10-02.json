earlier at six twenty six PM it's posted by the hill listen to this isn't how stupid this is\nA mutual friend up Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ... one of his sexual misconduct accusers and says written by a guy named Michael Burke has asked the FBI to investigate text messages that cabinet and his allies\nWhy center friends before her story was made public Terri Burch who\nWas that yeah when Kavanaugh was accused of exposing himself to Ramirez emailed FBI agent Jaycee McDonalds so these people are leaking now asking the agency to review those messages as part of it's reopened background investigation that Kavanaugh NBC News reported\nNBC reported that text messages between birch him in ... a year of Savage a friend of Kavanaugh's suggests the high Court nominee was discussing Ramirez is accusations with former classmates before the publication of a New Yorker piece about the allegations\nYeah Savage reportedly said in one message that Kevin I tried getting hurt to publicly defending him\nAll right two points before a story is published or broadcast\nTypically what happens is reporters go around and they ask questions\n\nThey ask questions they may even a vast Kavanaugh about it but they ask other people and they speak to other people and somebody could tell say Kavanaugh what's going on Kavanaugh here's about who they're going to publish this story and the New Yorker\nAnd he asks and I'm just taking it as it states like they could be dead wrong and he says to his friend um well I Hope you'll come to my defense you know I never did anything like that\nThis is I'm really innocent what they're trying to say is while he wouldn't have known about it but for the fact\nHe did what what uh Ramirez says\nThat's not true that's not true\nIf he heard that there was a story coming out maybe he was contacted maybe wasn't somebody else might have been contacted because house does a reporter write a story there asking around about Ramirez he may tax the friend\nBig deal\nSo I have a liberal colored says that grows Kavanaugh is guilty guilty\nI'm telling you\nAbsolute insanity in the media interesting isn't it\nHas NBC reported on a single back that this prosecutor\nPut in her ... before she put it in a memo\nOr even now have they done a long expos they and what's\nIn the ... you know they have not why not\nWhy not incredible\nAnd you know what every single one of those senators syndrome that Senate Judiciary committee\nYou know what they're thinking right now jeeze I Hope I'm never asked these questions I Hope I'm never asked these questions\nWellman\nFriend of mine rights me that the Montgomery County chief of police the county state's attorney says\nUm that are\nUnder the laws that existed in Nineteen eighty two the express Smith time or the allegations made by Dr Ford salt and attempted rape or both misdemeanor subject to a one year statute of limitations well that's true but they also said the other day that they're open for any complaint that wants to be a foul and they're happy to investigate it\nSo go ahead and finally your complain to stopping number filing a complaint that they're not going to file a complaint All right\nLet's take a few more calls here let's see let's go to\nLisa Brainerd, Minnesota accent satellite go\nTodd that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a poor you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller size and we help them with their finances they have a lot that can do they got more things\nAvailable and more more tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an account to a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand poised\nThere's a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with that big deficit out there and big debt out there or that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money you don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help us unbelievable\nAnd again this is just the classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with the horror with team they loved to help people they loved to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can
