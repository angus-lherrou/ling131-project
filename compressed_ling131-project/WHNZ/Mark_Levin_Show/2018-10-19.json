Trump junior\nHas come down and help and helped out Ted Cruz as well and I think what you're going to see on Monday Night is getting the people in Texas fired up to beat a this candidate that wants to open borders and says vote for me and all impeached Donald Trump which is not how this country's laws work\nWell and he wants to be wants to take our guns you don't take our guns in fact this nine out of ten people carry yes only carry you don't come here and\nSay you're going to take our guns I predict ban that it is going to be a landslide victory across\nI Hope you're right but I'm I Am cautious about it because I think that we were in trouble or just from not paying attention\nOr people feel secure your ... and I I Try to explain this the other day on TV I said the reason why Democrats are doing well is because there is mad as we were when Obama was in office at the end right and yeah so they're furious ... a fever pitch\nA lot of people if you got if you feel like things are under control and Donald trumps the president and you feel good about it and you feel like he's doing a good job and doing the right thing and wives getting good and you can enjoy life you're not as focused because you're not married you're not frustrated\nI Believe that Ted Cruz was in serious trouble from just lack of a of enthusiasm because people feel secure it they were comfortable and how things are going in Texas how things were going in Washington where Donald Trump being the president and now\nUh because of the character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh because Democrats have already said they're campaigning on you give us the control the house or the Senate we will impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump\nIs re engage the base and fire them up and that's why you're going to see the thing be sold out on Monday Night you're going to see standing room only you're going to see thousands it won't get in in Houston on Monday Night and and and and and that is they don't we under reported by the media guaranteed\nBack there and you should see the winning down here that the women are serious with what happened to cap it off because that's what happened everybody husbands in science and children are winning down here are so energize because they overplay their hand and and it's an ethical state with a loving\nThere are investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nTodd that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing\nYou still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a poor you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they've got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an account to a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand poised\nThere's a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plan unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with that big deficit out there and big debt out there or that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty\nTrillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions or a tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help us unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic

I mean and I'm Talking about liberals I'm Talking about the Daily Beast website which is which is a left leaning left complete total left the site\nSays I Can't believe that Joaquin Castro did that he doesn't then go on television and has an exchange with anyone no no no no he puts out his apology non apology denial non denial walked back on Twitter\nWhere he says I did not intend to say that Jared Kushner blah blah blah blah blah and of course there is no reporter not that there would be but maybe poppy Harlow over there at CNN would actually a raise their hand and say okay congressman Castro\nI understand your statement saying that you didn't intend can you tell us what you did intend to say because it seems pretty dang clear what you said\n\nAnd and and here's the best part of his

said\nAll I said was there was reporting\nTo the effect that Jared Kushner may have done that and Congress needs to investigate I you see and now and now that's that's the crux of it because they

the other day and it's getting no play and I'd just like an ally\nThanks Keith well it's not getting a lot of play because of all the way in terms of the news coverage is because the news focuses on
