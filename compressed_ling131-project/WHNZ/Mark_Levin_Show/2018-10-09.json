have this tendency to kind of you know want to understand how liberal see the world again I was never a liberal I'm I was an independent most of my life but what really opened me up to conservatism was this scene us moment\n\nAnd then they said I was a moment for me it was when I was a police officer in New York City\nAnd I saw how again I'm not suggesting every single time a cop access to you know there are listener unfortunately are bad cop cigarettes I'm telling you the overwhelming majority overwhelming I worked with were great guys and women who really just gave it to them they weren't there to get rich trust me there ain't no money in policing and it is a word in that case\n\nBut when I was a cop and I was an independent you know against some sometimes that even kind of see it the liberal way from being surrounded all the time by Democrats\n\nI remember how some cops in use of force incidents who I Know did nothing wrong they acted according to how they were almost viciously and immediately attacked by the media activists out there without even giving them a fair shake I'm telling you that was my that in a moment\nWhy said something's wrong here this is this isn't right I mean if you can just attack someone a police officer without even hearing his story in an unquestionably tragic incident that will use of force incidents are no one goes out in the street with the desire to get to use of force incidents sorry do you think that's what cops do your seriously seek professional help\nBut to see the way they were treated that was my they're saying a moment I'm

O. J. the information superhighway it was obvious in the deal Jay they mainline their\nRight to Bruce or who was the number four official into the OJ but was actually meeting with Christopher Steele who was paid to do this what what known as revealed this week Ken was a pivotal key piece of information\nAbout what makes this even more devastating and more profound because I get it I totally understand where the lives\nAre going to go with it so it was a guy had information or people pass informational ... no no no that's not the way that works\nThey'll typically passage through a field\nOffice that will investigate the vet the information they'll go into a court of law there'll be a grand jury at some point there will be some adversarial hearing either at some initial appearance later on or a trial\nThat's not what they did they walked into a Pfizer court where there was no ability for the Trump deep to defend themselves at all they brought information that was paid for by the Democrats and and and the real kicker here\n\nThe bureau lied about as\nJim Comey and others\nInsisted\nThat they didn't know where a lot of this information was coming from they didn't understand the political origins of it ladies and gentleman that is clearly a lie a fabrication at this point\nThat is clearly made up they were meeting with the lawyer who was being paid by the DNC\nIt was a fabrication it was made up it was nonsense why with the bureau lie about it these upper level managers if they had nothing to hide this is I I mean this answer this question answers itself\n\nThe information superhighway it was an effort to bypass all of these protections folks\nThis cases discuss than it is a grotesque abusive power when all the information comes out you're going to look at this you're going to read this I have this stuff in my book and you're going to sit there and say to yourself how the heck did this happen in the United states of America

pretty sure it's going to get ugly really fast and I think what it's going to expose is that information superhighway I told you about the bypassing of traditional channels to get information to the

give me a favor Mike let's play a little game here for a second I Love you to death thanks for the compliment Mr call screener forgives you I promise I Know you're a big market within fan to\nJust play a liberal for a second what you were going to say right here's what it says on the ... so I Want you to just act like I Know it's hard you are rational guy but I Want you to act like an irrational\nManiac from it so you weren't going to say it's ridiculous that we are bred cabin on the bed too many allegations we don't need any doubts behind this guy this is terrible this was in a criminal court trial this was a job interview right Mike is not what you were going to say wink and a nod\nThat's that's how I got on the air [laughter]\nWell let me I'm not obviously not arguing with you I Know you're making that up but let's just say we were it isn't a job interview which you well know might\nThis due process supplies everywhere this was not a job interview in the traditional sense what job interview I Can't believe I'm arguing with a guy is a conservative pretended to be a little bit but\nWhat job interview anywhere in the world are you allowed to present twelve years of work related experience like Kavanaugh did sitting on the D.C ... circuit course all of these opinions right\nAnd then someone at the last minute says you you're a gang rape is produced is no evidence that that's actually true tells it to a creepy poor lawyer and all of a sudden the job goes out the window the answer is nowhere\nSo it's a complete total nonsense but Mike thank you for the call thank you for the compliment thank you for playing fake liberal for a minute I really he missed the call screener many gotcha by and never happens you are like you are the do you like the human polygraph tests of to\nCreate [laughter] [noise] well you know it it is tough though sometimes to this is mark show is one of the most popular radio programs in the country and sometimes it is hard All right let me take another call let's take who do we gotta who do you think it's good to\nGo to Matthew in California Love California by the way I'm headed out there sooner political and if any of you are going out there so stop by and say hello Matthew what are you got for us\nHey what's going on man I Want to play angry blue collar worker who goes to work everyday and watches the Iliad get away with criminal all crap\nThat's a that listed man go head knocked out one out because I Love the every I Love people who work for a living and so you got me what do you got\nWhen is it going to happen when a leader and the Republicans come together in an actual investigation into the Clinton Foundation\nUranium one to see them selling off twenty percent of hardworking Americans uranium across the country falling out a way forever for a hundred and fifty million dollars to the foundation when an investigation going to start when is she going to be put under the microscope\nAnd why are people can actually fight back against the Democrats or the biggest\nDemocrats that I've seen in the last Twenty years and I'm only thirty one years old\nBut if you know I don't know all of us that especially the blue collar workers I work with every day over at the refinery work are blocked off\nAccess to get taken away helps for everybody else who doesn't work for a living\nThere are investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nDie that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right so if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your ... you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee and we have a lot of employees\nYou use we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a poor you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they've got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an account to a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with that big deficit out there and big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me I'll let me teach you what I Know go ask your advised your questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with the Harwood team they loved to help people bail loved to help their clients they love to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide and let the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls is what it comes

second opinion on your portfolio\nBob Let's also dive into\nOne of the ... how do people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if it was saved enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done that said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he listens or radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years and says finally I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire road map\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be you said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need to use that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people

nine five four to seven died for online that's the hard way that ah [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nProceeding was a commercial program paid for by Harwood financial the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporate\n[noise] with more helpful\nSo and twenty eight days we have to decide whether Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton and the war war hero Richard Blumenthal and ah and Chuck Schumer and\nNancy Pelosi should be in charge of the Congress where this behavior will become even more mainstream which to me is impossible winners and losers I was talking to Richard Samantha and also Richard Valdez earlier that great producers of the ... show to talk about the winners and losers of what happened with a\nWith a course today Kevin ... on the U.S Supreme Court number one the biggest winner I think is due process in fairness\nThe principal and old fashioned principle that the mob does not rule and that's a presumption of innocence supplies and that's some substantive and procedural due process must apply the second big winner is my president Donald\nJohn Trump not singing one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office that Trump's scored a hundred and Democrats have scored zero\nThe economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle has been won by Trump including South Korea\nNext fall will be the God does he does in Beijing and communist red China that takes about five hundred billion dollars a year so it in the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them\nSo when Trump gets done with the Chinese and it's going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea and now according Erasmus and it came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pen cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit ... Carter what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh you are an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful it was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only half stack up he continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this\nKavanaugh was a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals\nHe's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin a further and further and further Kavanaugh kind of local looked over Trump and said that's my motto\nThat's the guy I Want to be they never imagined that I Will be middle aged judge from Yale\nHad in him to fight back and no holds barred straight parole or fashion But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his or all of his grade school girls' basketball coach and you're teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened\nA maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kavanaugh he in a sense hypnotic ... took on Trump's personality and he fought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin Oh one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you got to fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after Christine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about their claustrophobia and how it changed her life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kavanaugh get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth well she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses in every whatever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever\nThe therapists notes were critical to this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the mid Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to rape her\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and change what she was saying in order to\nTry to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and a direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door was put in not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way and of course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Tahiti travel do ally travel to Central America travel to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said had any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's all right Susan Collins put up on Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment to the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we are four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer\nIn charge of the Senate and the investigations that would be launched and all the problems that arise\nSo tonight I Want to get your perspective mark Levin is off until Monday he'll be back then was some well deserved time off the great American built Cunningham is here also I Want to also led to know that a ... and has a new book out called our police\nOur police which is perfect for children\nMay go on Amazon to order at now our police by jak live in the great father I think he's in his nineties ... back with you on Monday but this show is yours I Want to hear from you tonight the number to call this eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one\nEight seven seven

Saturday Night or Sunday tweeted out whatever happens I'm just glad we'd ruin Brett Kavanaugh as life\nSo this clown this fool and New York aerial do moss working for Steve and coal Baron CBS is Late Show is happy that the life\nOf Brett Kavanaugh is now ruined that his wife's life Israel and that his daughter's life has ruined and morality guess what Ariel doom is break Kevin O's life is not ruined\nHis name is not ruined his name is associate justice Brett Kavanaugh because he sat today this morning on the United States Supreme court where it's going to be for the next thirty to forty years but that's the mentality that we're fighting with plus I Want to\nHours later the remaining ice workers were finally evacuated by a small federal police team the facilities shut down for more than a week they couldn't function [noise]\nComplete rapid mob violence in Portland, Oregon which is similar to what's happening in San Francisco and other cities but now the protesters in Portland are back on the streets blocking traffic have you seen the videos several dozen\nOr in a particularly disturbing video protesters takeover intersections stopped traffic braiding harass older white men in cars who refused to obey their traffic directions Portland police under the idiotic leadership of mayor Ted Wheeler do nothing\nThey yell at these older white men you're a little white supremacist go back to the south know KKK here et cetera\nIn one video protesters smashed an older white man sedan with baseball bats after he makes a turn against their wishes they've taken over the streets shouting who streets our streets\nAfter the drivers zipped down the street to get away from them they chased after and for some reason he stopped going out of his car to inspect the damage he is carbon ends can administer more damage it got back in his car quickly ahead of the\nMob and left this emerging random called St anarchy has lost money asking Portland married Ted Wheeler during control of the city which he refuses to do\nWas flipped describe what if some city maybe in the south a whole bunch of white supremacist we're polling black people out of their cars and beating the hell out of them are damaging their property taken over the streets yelling who streets our streets what the hell what happened [noise]\nAll hell breaks loose or what had happened in Charlottesville which was a terrible deeds committed upon that woman who was killed the person responsible was subjected to federal hate crime legislation a ... I'm Sorry indictment plus arrest and he should have been killed somebody\nAnd that was roundly condemned this violence is going to lead the shootings\nOh wait a minute I forgot Steve's beliefs of Louisiana was shot and almost killed by a Democrat a Bernie Sanders supporter who wanted to kill Republican congressman chased out of restaurants in the elevators on streets in airports the left as mobs have been ... and all their supporters are doing exactly what Hillary Clinton\nAnd what the Democratic Party wants done or they overplay their hand\nFor weeks from today from tonight for weeks some die we're gonna have a good idea\nWhether this leftist mob is controlling the Congress ... probably not but I'm not so sure so let's continue with more once again the line to call his eight seven seven three eight one three eight one one still hunting and the great American in for the gray one Muslim [noise]\n\nThe national debt is now over twenty ... what happens next rising inflation drops of dollars some experts say another crashes coming what will be left of your investments for your children are your grandchildren\nWill you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins in an IRA from Augusta precious metals\nDuring periods of great volatility precious metals regularly outperform stocks because they were true wealth has said that have real value during the through your recovery period after the two thousand eight crash the Dow went up only three point five percent well gold doubled in price calling\nUs now at eight five five eight five eight five it was seven and learn how to Iraq\nBack my physical golden sword can hedge against inflation and build a true legacy for your family regained control of your financial destiny and calling us are precious metals right\nNow they'd five five eight five eight five eight oh seven and get your free gold i._r._a. guide called eight by five eight five eight five eight oh seven as an investment\nThe price of gold and silver may fluctuate over time and you could lose money check with financial and legal advisors or [noise]\nOr shot at Los Alamos in dollars nationwide gee we're back to two hundred two hundred you'll get a text confirming entry heart radio in the scanner data that's ... that's ... tissue on drink to hundred [noise] Syria seal program\nThe next generation of remaining shall we nighttime\nThe ... the starting my [noise]\nMy love America as passionately cerebral and talk with that voice now eighty seven seven three one two three one one\nGOOD Music rich keep the music going like this music people [noise]\nThings are getting a little more normal\nMust continue when a U.S marine calls I always listen I Love Marines love what they stand for my daddy was a marine John in Washington DC I get Marines presidents here no cutting him in ... John please go ahead\nAnd show following this thing for intently from start to where it is now and uh absolutely I agree with your opening bottle first off facts are stubborn things you know and and the words of our of our [laughter]\nOur president John Adams a you know if you're just guy sect and look strictly at ... and you go off the values of the country that you don't proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling you can't wait to no kidding of course you know all this guy he's guilty\nJohn last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was that the president declared a innocent a bread Kevin isn't that what\nHe is aren't you innocent until proven guilty and this wasn't the case but it just wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine to give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the Senate\nAnd it kind of walk a Christina for down the ... path\nWhen she oddly question her about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector tests and now I'm watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew was that the ex boyfriend oh Christine afford and by the way Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend who sold his credit cards but I redress\nBut what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a friend for taking a lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit it's a boyfriend and Christine afforded the Nineteen Ninety said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governors administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything\nThat Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taking airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector tests so Christine of forward lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status\nDoes not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt I mean that that is the only conclusion and one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting that kind of a tactic is actually a lot of\n[laughter] that's that's terrified because you're now hey take somebody a lesser degree or a lesser income in life or whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just coming back or something like that\nThere could be no coming back whether whether you know just the fear factor and it can be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's it life as\nWell with John Waters cabin all go to get back his reputation if you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused of rape\nAnd there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know what had happened didn't know how it happened and the four witnesses she possessed supplied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about and bounced out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight\n[laughter] that would that would be it wouldn't come back you know but then again I wouldn't get their due process from such a thing\nYou know John I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh\nUh someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a Chevrolet if so if you go in and say my left foot is hurting I'm not going to say well don't you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho are wrongfully convicted of sexual assault a Gregory counts and Van Dyke Perry to black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a hub State University case were for college man at Hofstra overcharged raping an Eighteen year old fellow students\nThey came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused of someone of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look her in the eye which the Senate denied\nAnd now that we took ... know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media tore apart the story of Christian afford improve that she was either upper barricade or or lie or or both\nI think what you could do that over time just\nDoing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and he has people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members of medicine here and it's growing like crazy find out how much you could save and why men to share is so popular go to ... dot com or called eight\nSix six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six eighty eight Bible Medicare dot com or eight six six eighty eight Bible or driving\nLiberal or at least do some common sense from Muslims in\nMarshall event is on close it doubled ... Gen Z nice seven to ... [noise]\nWhat\nThings can I put to rest the idea that this president is not\nNormal I hear about the norms of the presidency\nLet's talk about norms a presidency going back to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was that normal\nHow about the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assaulting Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping Juanita Broderick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky then he violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three\nIncrease taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in the war in Iraq the costs four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran\nThat Bush forty three get us into the norms of the president says that normal then you had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV it's not the norm of the presidency\nSo please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nOther male cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the president's even LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water great in line did he violated how 'bout Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the president's so please save me the embarrassment\nOf trying to convince me that Trump is somehow violating the norms of the presidency is if Obama and Bush and Clinton\nAnd Bush and LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the president say please save me\nWas continuing our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show bleach sharing go ahead\nI I just wanted to say thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley your role\nHe really had to hold the line on some pretty um strong personalities you wanted to pull any direction a critic cars as much trouble are great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms ... listen to a liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the presidency by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDidn't violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal did they violate the norms of the Senate and did the eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside\nThe Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do you think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance of the center I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\nAnd another point", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "09"}
