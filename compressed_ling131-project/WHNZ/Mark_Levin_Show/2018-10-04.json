there's no escaping that fact\nAnd to have a party or in one point of our history where its primary objective was to protect slavery another time in its history its primary objective was to protect segregation\n\nA war fought over slavery\n\nRiots in wars if he will domestically fought over segregation\n\nThen they claim the mantle of civil rights when it's the Republican Party\nThat oppose slavery and oppose segregation those were not Republican governor standing in the door house and then the Democrats trying to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nNo they're not in the least\n\nThe old Democrats are gone\n\nThey didn't turn into young Republicans\n\nBut this mindset\nOf nullification you can see with sanctuary cities secession you can see it in California with the radical left\n\nThe mindset about destroying individual human beings the mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democrat Party\n\nThey just change their approach it's all about power the Democrat Party cannot survive if the nation is United what is the Democrat Party the Democrat Party is an entity a political entity\n\nThat is made up of disparate parts based on race based on religion or no religion based on income based on age\n\nAnd so forth and so and it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we try to discuss the constitution of the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\n\nThere objective is always how to get power and how to keep it had to advance the cause whether they want elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the early progressive tell you why because

through one hundred thousand\nPages that\nBoxes and boxes of material\nIf it were you know hard copy as opposed to a a electronically provided well they got it from the government obviously\n\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office the attorney general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue so what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great well you've

important announcement regarding the president's decision to terminate the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity with Iran a treaty Iran made a mockery of where the support for terrorism provocative ... missile proliferation and malign behavior throughout the middle east [noise]\nToday's decision by the international court of justice was a defeat for on it correctly rejected nearly all of Iran's requests but we're disappointed that the icy Jay failed to recognize that it has no jurisdiction to issue any order with respect to sanctions the United states imposes\nTo protect its own essential security under the treaty\nInstead the court allowed Iran to use it as a forum for propaganda [noise]\nThe Iranian regime has systematically pursued a policy of hostility toward the United states\nThought that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners\n... you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe ... mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant opposition and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plan unfortunately is temporary our hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with that big deficit out there and big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advise your questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money you don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help us unbelievable\nAnd again this

people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if it was saved enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done that said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he listens or radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years and says finally I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything he needs for a comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just tell me he said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need to use that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving
