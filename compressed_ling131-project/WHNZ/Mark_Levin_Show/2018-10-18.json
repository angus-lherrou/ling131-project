president a forty five Donald J dropping\nA Mr President before we get too deep into this money is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about millennials trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live\nAnd she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty a\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I love the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you are going to continue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just that on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact on\nMe and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do not cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be right in and South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nTrade deal and we're also the piggy banks and everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we tell them look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominees or what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S embassy a and it works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now it just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so we're\nFriends how many jobs and talking to my Everytime I Can't I'm actually I Will be talking about a million\nWell you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to it if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair enough farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they uh they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even not elected\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing your cars because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then a with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but\nArguments about in your home phone sample

or two after the president one is a federal court case against Michael Evan ... and a Stormy Daniels president use the term horse face that describes Stormy Daniels\nAnd what he did that the media especially Brian seltzer and tapper and others is CNN went crazy melt down over the horse face common awful it was and this wasn't about a woman\nThis it was about women in general see what CNN artfully does is take the comments about one person\nAnd generically apply to everyone in the group because they believe in group rights group identity so in this case horse face ... described Stormy Daniels according to the president and the media had a virtual meltdown for a day day and a half on\nThe president using the term horse race that describes Stormy Daniels\n[noise] that it came out a couple of days ago the TI the rapper is doing an awful video [noise]\nWhich are two packs a depicts millennia Trump is a stripper in the oval office\nAnd I saw about three seconds of it that was it for me and I'm not going to watch it however CNN spent little or no time on the issue that now important rappers or using millennia Trump in a strip her outfit engage in sexual acts in\nThe oval office as if she was working for Bill Clinton\nSo I'm waiting now for the first ladies that are still alive like Roslyn quarter or Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama or Laura Bush the former ranks around malaria Trump and say this is a bridge too far you can't sexual ours our first lady\nFor commercial benefit and get away with it which is the late night topics of coal bear and the Jimmy's you hear it constantly sexual ... making fun of the brilliant first lady we have millennia Trump\nSo how is it worthy of constant unrelenting criticism when a porn star is called horse faced by the president but when I first lady is depicted as a stripper engaged in sexual acts in the oval office\nThat somehow that\nIs not worthy of being covered and that's the other first ladies stood on envelop her in fact have you seen any efforts by Laura Bush or Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama\nTo spend time and make more legitimate interview with the mainstream media issues legitimate with me money at Trump who is by far the most brilliant\nFirst lady we've ever had she speaks five or six languages she's wonderful\nBut the media will not allow her to be the president's wife without sexual icing her calling Aaron ignoramus doesn't speak correctly doesn't speak the English well enough for Stephen Colbert there who makes fun of her on a constant basis\nSo if we lived in a fair country with fair media media calling balls and strikes\nYou would have criticisms against those in Hollywood and the entertainment industry who wants to sexual lies and make the legitimate and minimize our first lady throughout the world\nAnd you would have the other first ladies the other Florida says coming together to say stop it don't do it can you imagine just think for a moment\nIf some country star\nFour or five years ago sexual allies Michelle Obama\nAnd put her in sexy outfits performing sex acts in the oval office Michelle Obama\nWhat do you think the view Kobe or Hollywood the New York times every big city newspaper every magazine if they still exist websites where to go absolutely crazy this would be the worst thing in the world\nTo make fun of and sexual lies the parents I'm Michelle Obama and it should happen I Want the same behavior that would apply to Michelle Obama do apply to him a lot of Trump because they're in the same category doing the same kinds of good things may today\nEarlier today millennia Trump plane filled with smoke on her way I think to Philadelphia and she still made the trip\nThis is a brave courageous woman who's married to a great president but the media wants to make the legitimate both diminished shoe they are and make them objects of scoring and ridicule because it plays well I guess what the audience is an audience out there for this\nYou know about fifty percent of the country loved the guy in fifty percent loads and made him the dislike and the hatred for Bush was nothing compared to this and so I'm waiting for the apocryphal see the stop\nAnd for the news coverage to begin\nOne more big our room it remains let's\nGo back to the causes time allows we have ah am Amarillo, Texas been there for an hour and a half

southern border to protect our nation's interests\nAnd and it it would be ... by All right because this is what a normal president does know what a normal mother or father would do to protect their house or a normal person would do to protect their business I mean this is no different than putting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a ... system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your\nGear up if I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\n\nNow all of this I said to go back to a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this coming in from work before or many of you know me I I play tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country as a student with a student visa legally\nThey didn't break in and they didn't come in a caravan they didn't chant they didn't yell and they love America and the both of them are still here and both of them love this country and respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way\nI have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you're doing the appropriate and the right way and you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break in your house because I Want your TV I'm not going to go buy my own\n\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation sets\nYou you know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally it it it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out\nThere will be a very strong response from this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most irritating things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with his care of eight of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough done this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should calm down and she'll be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care venting to the United states and then when he does that you criticize him for doing it saying he's on hands these crazy and he's mean and even when he's so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr shouldn't make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freak out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrageous have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they allowed women to drive in Saudi Arabia because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw let's give them a license that will shut up the world\n\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut off ... feet\nAs part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or to criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify what Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken a life his own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his but but but the media who's acting like this is something we must\nWere I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because of what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\n\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I also know why we are an ally with them because they are extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do we also need a place that we can land we also need a\nPlace that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nAgreed that it's important they all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump ... Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other votes agrees with Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nI were having a hard time hearing you hearing you with the dog so let's see if we can get a better connection\nIn the meantime I Will try to try that again in a moment one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven is Donald Trump during the right thing is president to defend the border and say I will sin [noise]\nThe military down there to stop this caravan this is what leadership strong leadership looks like Ferguson filling in for the great one we'll be right back\n[noise]\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that fills your cardiovascular health keeping vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide\nSuper base by human as harness the power of nutrient rich beach\nAnd created a super food that helps your body make more nitrogen oxide on its own one teaspoon of super beats daily support your cardiovascular health and blood pressure levels giving your natural energy without\nThe need of a quick caffeine cat or a sugar high we're talking real healthy natural energy ... eight six six to zero five for nine\nZero seven or go to super beach dot com backslash loved in L.
