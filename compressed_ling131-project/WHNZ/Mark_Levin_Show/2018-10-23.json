district of Texas it's a close race my buddy ... chip power user\nWork I'm doing great thanks for having me on on how to be joining us from our taxes were Texas on our all fired up and ready to be defending against the salt for people outside of ... thanks for having me on\n[noise] and your site is chip Roy dot com I Hope will have all of insurgency can use some cash so we can get some ads up there in the last few weeks chip Roy dot com also folks and the twenty first district isn't that a trip\nThat is the twenty first congressional district in the center taxes and appreciate\nYou saying that about my website we were spending every dollar the Democrats are under assault here I got to tell you I was out there early voting hours at a rally with Governor Abbott wife wondering what your ego obviously now gone down to you\nBut then it was Senator Cruz it's been a great day uh we've been all over the district people are fired up but I'll tell you early voting numbers are really high really really high they've smashed all records\nOn I think in areas that indicate that on both sides of the of the aisle if you will so we've got to do our part to get the vote turned out because if we turned out we went\n[noise] yeah early voting in Texas has started as with other states and ladies and gentlemen if you hear me right now I really don't put this off get out there and voter and you know what the early voting was set up by the left to trying to end or change the system you can take advantage of it to go ahead and vote early\nAnd the more uh people who do that the better now tell us\nHow your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways Sen Cruz is raised a and it is a a you know tight and and and and hard fought but very winnable race or with the support of your listeners a lot of good Texas we feel good but we feel that it's necessary for everybody to show up\nIn order for us to when my opponent as I think you know is a a a very liberal Democrat very liberal who served in the United States Army and I think of her service but he uses that to try to claim centrism to claim independent that he's running and his dad\nBut there is nothing centrists and nothing independent about somebody who was already said he would vote to impeach Donald Trump who's already said that he would undo the tax cuts it was already said that he would put in place a carbon tax\nIs already said that he wants to regulate guns he wants to single payer government run health care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give him the other countries\nAnd I can go down a long list but he is trying to run into ... not but I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they are seeing through Mr O'Rourke a efforts\nTo a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\nAnd a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't they\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much ah we're seeing that both with congressman O'Rourke as well as my opponent and others uh the Democrats very purposely went out and recruited leftists\nWho could run because they may have worn a uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my own and he never has a response\nWhy would my opponent or why we'd better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or senator\nTo do all of these social as things were at least it's constitutionally reasonable to have the debate\nTheir investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nDie that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificant way on your tax return and it should save every body that is an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a pool you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an account to a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere's a lot of things available to you in this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already putting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my\nFeeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with that big deficit out there in big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me I'll let me teach you what I Know go ask your advised your questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with a Harwood team they loved to help people they love to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide and let the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls is what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine\nAnd just say I love to come in and meet the Harwood team and get that second opinion on your portfolio\nBob Let's also dive into\nOne of the ... how do people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's still in his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done said eight out of ten of Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what\nIs your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he was just a radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years and says finally I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just tell me he said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough for what I Need is that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving enough you don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my job is to make
