bill you by lying and ... and ... on us jam that you're not communists folks cooking or the other night\nNow during the confirmation process I met was sixty five senators and explain my approach to the law I participated in more than thirty hours of hearings before the Senate Judiciary committee and I submitted written answers to nearly Thirteen hundred additional questions I was grateful for the opportunity\nAfter all those meetings and after my initial hearing concluded I was subjected to wrongful and sometimes vicious allegations my time in high school and college more than Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced vile and violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement a response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement an answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise] I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've ever been I might have been too emotional at times I'd rather my tongue was sharp and I said a few things they should not have said I Hope everyone can understand that I was there is a son has been in that\nI testified with five people for most of my mind my mom my dad and my wife and most of all my daughter's\nGoing forward you can count on me to be the same kind of judge a person I've been for my entire twenty eight year legal career hardworking even killed open minded independent and dedicated to the constitution and the public good\nAs a judge I've always treated colleagues and lead against the utmost respect I've been known for my courtesy on and off the bench I have not changed and will continue to be the same kind of judge I been for the last twelve years and I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach volunteer and teacher\nEvery day I Will try to be the best husband died and friend I can be I Will remain optimistic on the sunrise side of them out and I will continue to see the day that is coming up the day that has gone\nI reviewed the constitution I Believe that it independent impartial judicious raised a central direct constitutional republic if\nConfirmed by the Senate to serve on the Supreme Court I Will keep an open mind in every case and always strive to preserve the constitution of the United states and the American rule of law\nBrett Kavanaugh to beautiful up it won't matter one with the Democrats or the media\nAnd the three Republican stooges are really wanting their own careers and positioning themselves and don't give a wet about judge Kavanaugh his wife his kids or his parents [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] oh several times to judge mentions in this op ed the constitution and therein lies his problem\n\nThe reason he's hated by the less the reason is under attack by the Democrats [noise] the reason the media went would gossip and rumor and really defamation is because his declared support for the constitution they do not support it\nThey do not support the constitution except both take the free press part because they think it protects them\n[noise] but when it comes to the constitution a trash constitutional originalists and texture lists where throw backs don't you know unless we embrace the progressive agenda and in trying it\nAs a constitutional matter there by rewriting the constitution with nearly five justices\nThan we justice Kavanaugh must be destroyed it is the constitution that gets in the way of the progressive agenda don't you say\nIt's the constitution that they despise\n\nThey make no sense whatsoever when they talk about the constitution when they talked about precedent when they talk about precedent\nWe know I suppose that they must embrace Dred Scott they must ... plus and they must embrace Korematsu that's precedent\nIt's precedent that was rejected as precedent the case that Dred Scott it took a civil war to undo it the case of plus eight fifty eight years to undo it\nCase Korematsu it still hasn't been done\nThose were activists judges who did not follow the constitution of the United states that's why this is an important debate they insist on abortion it's not in the\nConstitution so they demand precedent they insist on their entire social agenda there are environmental agenda it's not in the constitution but they demand they insisted on all powerful centralized government to advance threats\nGender that's not in the constitution either and they insist that the individual in states well that they accept this new rewritten constitution despite the fact that you and I have never participated in amending it\nIt's because judge Kavanaugh reviewers the constitution not just the name but an action as he declares and here's despise and he is hate it because it's a threat to the progressive agenda\nSo the more he talks about reverence for the constitution the more he talks about following the constitution the more he is despised I'll be right

Christian faith like healthy vibrant people of Judaism is a good thing for this country and a good thing for the world where do you say\nIt couldn't be better state and I mean we as I mentioned injury to reiterate what I said before\nWe we stand then would fight to the death to protect the rights\nOf liberty for everyone not just ourselves that's not a self interest thing it is it is we blame on the bottom our hearts that everyone ought to be free everyone has made in God's image everyone has an alien of All right in this country to liberty\nAnd we do Dale Jews and Christians have such a healthy attitude toward\nA morality and toward God in which we share the same absolute values and these values guide us and govern our society and our hire a constitutional framework is based on those values and no other country in the history of the world even comes close to the principles that under gr this\nA constitutional republic there were some great empires but they were empires America's not even an empire and that is the most powerful nation and the history of the world it could have dominated and taking over the world but it has been benign it\nHas been shoplift and it or not self worth that his work is looked at its own self interest but it it's not sought to conquer other nations and exploit other nations contrary to the to the left a history revision as a uh in every respect most both domestically and form a our religious principles\nAre what stand behind the things that make this country great\nTo tell you something um and I've been reading through your book and it is fascinating to me as a non Christian um you write beautifully you write in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way down\nOr you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that uh and uh and and you can see the uh the decency in your writing the earnest this in your writing\nAnd uh and you raised a point earlier or when we were talking a in the first segment\nAnd that is in just mentioned it again the founding of this nation I people need to understand [noise] uh that the men who founded this nation not all of them but almost all of them were Christians\nWho met at the uh who met and I'm On July Fourth would the declaration of independence and men in Philadelphia again in the constitution and look at what they did even look at the first amendment what they did they didn't establish a religion even though they could have potentially\nDie that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right so if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that is an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars which is what I estimate and that's a really good thing\nYou still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a poor you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employees a thousand employees\nThere's a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already putting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling\nAnd is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there and big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the

that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if we would save enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done that said eight out of ten of Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he wishes or radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years is just fine with you I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be you said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough for what I Need is that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving enough you don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my

first the most important thing be second is that there are two sides to stories in one side effects [noise]\nNow you're the facts\nAnd it's something that drove me crazy crazy crazy crazy [noise]\nDelivered a speech and among the things I never imagined that I Would be saying [noise]\nOne that oh my God Chuck Grassley who's left\nSusan Collins this afternoon\nDelivered the most remarkable speech\nI've ever heard ... deliver\nHere ... got a\nLot of interesting interesting things going on\nBut any context that there are two sides to stores\n... one side effects ... last Thursday you have so many people including the aforementioned Susan Collins who was unbelievable today\n... said that you know what she was really credible really credible Christine forward you know really believe ... and ah you know so it was ... Cavanaugh how many times did you hear that from people\n... yeah you know they both were known and we're not you know they were not going to be\n... somebody was lying\nSomeone ... testifying ... last Thursday\nWas really\nReally committing an active evil\nAnd that person based on all the information available ...\nSee filled out people are treating her with kid gloves ... but in this moment where by age to vote margin we're advancing to the final votes tomorrow and break ... only five o'clock eastern time\nIt's also important ... Christine Ford\nSaying that she has one hundred percent certain that Brett Cavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nBut she is not allowed to just white off into the sunset is though she never made those claims now there's not going to be any accountability ... there's no way in the world but the the Senate\nJudiciary Committee is gonna pursue her for perjury\n... should there should be a full investigation out for\nAs long as I have an opportunity to do so\n... what she did it's an act of evil ...\nTrying to ruin a man's wife said she has one hundred percent certain providing witnesses none of which corroborate anything she said ... wrong\nThat's wrong and it's important\nThough when we are confronted with axis of evil in this society ... false accusations by someone like Christine forward ... they are called out for what they are and she is\nMade to to have to account for what she is which is a perpetrator\nA woman who committed an active evil\nBut there are some folks that go yeah but she might really be a sexual assault victims okay it's ... I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victims ... sexual assault and they go out in the murders somebody down the line are they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life\n... absolutely are held accountable for murder right now what was she tried to do to break out and I'm One hundred percent certain\nThere was ...\nTrying to effectively\n... ruin that man's life\nHis family's life\nHow evil do you have to do that\nSo I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims\n... somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did\nAnd it's important once again\nThat we don't just white off because ... gonna make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there are all the others\nWe ended up a boarding the\nBiggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know\n... Chuck Schumers credibility\nOr the Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in by the way I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know\n... not and things aren't going you're way right now and ... what's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are\nWe're on ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you're someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise\n... then we all need to acknowledge\nAnd who the perpetrator was\nAnd recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay ... as well we'll be called out the made accountable for who and what they are\n... couple things are just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way\n... it really has been that kind of a way past that\n... that kind of couple of weeks ago ... three months ...

straight to the FBI boys\nKnow I'm right before the break mentioned persuading people how to persuade somebody politically or over the course of my career it is the single most common question I have receipt\nAnd [noise] the easiest way to tell you how to persuade someone to tell you who you shouldn't be attempting to persuade\nPeople are closed minded\nIf somebody is genuinely not open to information [noise]\nOdds are you're not going to get anywhere\nAnd that's the problem most people and this is true conservatives to by the way it's it's not like this is unique to liberals are a lot of close minded conservatives too but you got to be open a new information and you need to identify who those people are in your life you know I mentioned\nThe Kavanaugh polling firm gallon that start to finish everything that's happened over the past three months everything public sentiment Brett Kavanaugh only shifted by seven points the entire time but\nAt most seven percent of this country was even persuadable a brick Kavanaugh [laughter]\nJust go to the average person in that opposes your thought process and expect to get some way somewhere now you did it all you're doing is banging your head against the wall\nAnd you're going to make yourself on happy\nSo if you want to be persuasive the first thing\nI find the right people people are open to information not the loudest people who will fight with you politically and the next thing is credibility [noise]\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make\n... because once you\nGive up your credibility why is anybody going to listen to you\nFor that reason operate with facts\nOperate with information that he just operate with opinions independent of the facts and the information somebody who is otherwise open to that information they're just going to view you as someone who is highly political trying to can communicate\nOr your your emotion rather than principal a because typically what you'll find for those that are truly persuadable\nUh is that they are analytical and that they genuinely are inquisitive looking for more information and by the way this surprises a lot of people\nBut I find that common link ... the millennials\nAre a number of reasons and it starts with the economy [noise]\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are closing in on the legal to drink [noise]\nThe youngest one's oldest one's like thirty five thirty six now\nAnd I have not blame them right along\nBecause when was it that they came of age\nThey came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment speech them [noise]\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible [noise]\nAnd they weren't able to get a opportunity [noise]\nAnd so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us that here we are\n... never seen a good economy [noise]\nNever seen a good economy\nRight now is one of the most important windows of time\nWe have two

five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven the Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting against foreign Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I mean it's\nA ... uh it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so uh the it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact something that's interesting\nThat developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she didn't want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically Kevin I Would have been dead now than it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical to with her voting no uh uh you know she has\nCome under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been gone about not screaming not protesting not people that are chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up her office or with phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been a pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have her way here the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals [noise]\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions that would impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit rulings ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Africans seems like at least some might\nNow actually be reconsidering\nWhen I was taking a look at the most likely outcome here\nOr it looks like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process is the positives that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee\nUntil the past couple of weeks [noise]\nHaven't known many\nI I mean even you\nKnow and the student
