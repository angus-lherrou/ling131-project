set up in people's faces they get in a crowd and make us see has pushed\nBack home yeah your point is that the left has been agitating for a fight [noise] and ah why aren't they responsible for their own language and their own conduct thank you\nRadio waves still force fail\nYou don't want to listen to our ... our radio ads [noise] download it now\nDale appears to have been rejected by a DC circuit panel is premature\nThe witnesses lawyers asked the full bench of uh of appeals court to review that decision but a notation in court filings says only nine of the court's ten active judges participated bowing out was judge Greg cat cats is the court suddenly member appointed by president Donald Trump\nCats are served as deputy White House counsel before Trump tapped him for the powerful D.C court of appeals last year\nGoes on\nA spokesman for Mueller's office Peter car declined to comment on the litigation\nLawyers for Trump said the mystery grand jury subpoena fight moving through the DC circuit at nothing to do with the president know ideas that Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging Mahler subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses in the mall or investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record well all records about the litigation and the district quarter sealed\nThe DC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought in the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on September at Nineteen the initial appeal was filed five days later [noise]\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone found a motion to quash or otherwise resisted a grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know it Gibson Dunn and crush or attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nSo unclear what is the case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on mother's a party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments\nVery hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell you it's not hard to tell at all [noise] Mr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making\nAnd professor caliber ISI has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing\nBut it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas by challenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again I because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat the mullahs investigation because they couldn't serve as vehicles to get questions of its authority and legal legitimacy before ... judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of his criminal cases but all the human defendants who\nSet foot in a courtroom and ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel's authority or tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters or aren't uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\n\nThis can't this can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry to recall the case from a previous investigation where you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion\nBecause there was under steal All right\n\nI'm fairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller I counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause in the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst than others this is not the Martian versus Olson case a Thirty Years' ago involving the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Mahler and this is why these two questions are important to stay with me 'cause you're smart and you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before\nIs Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\n\nOr is he an inferior office\nFor purposes of a challenge\nTo the appointments clause of the constitution I have no doubt that he insists that he's in fear officer who reports to deputy attorney general Rosen steam\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate he's nothing more than an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney or jeopardy\nTo an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney\nAnd the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial appointment was enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that\nSo this isn't like Morrison versus also know the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge of is it's hard I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd I more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court in the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is uh is going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activist so the the final case will have to be made to the Supreme Court if they'll accept it will be right back [noise] [noise]\nI'm Gordon Diehl joined me tomorrow morning five to nine on twelve fifty W.

most populated state\nAnd of course the left would love nothing more than to control the governorship and the control what takes place in that state prior to the twenty twenty election as they would Texas and uh it's very important this rates the taking place in Florida and the Democrat is about as radical left as you can get\nIn the left all over the country is pouring millions and millions of dollars into this including billionaires who the the usual suspects\nRun to scientists who have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um Tallahassee\nIs a very corrupt government under this mayor there's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government\nAh to get basically sending money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what these lobbyists did is they arrange a number of excursions one of which was the New York city I'm In a long for the ride on that was a\nUndercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate at\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to go see the play Hamilton Rene people hear about these Hamilton pick addicted to like go to the movie the tickets were at least a thousand dollars at that time um and so he gave it\nTo Andrew Andrew knew that Andrews lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that\nBut then those same while the U.S also arranged a luxury for night stay in this Costa Rica villa which ended up talking about a thousand dollars a for Andrew and his wife a an addition to some other folks and getting injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLow involved mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those lobbyist two million dollar deal that they were looking for it so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobby it's got a exactly what they were paying for it so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has he lied to the country on Sunday night when I brought it up about this\nBut then documents came out almost immediately that refuted is denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can because he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line or the older that day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart and the law you understand the stuff\nWhat an FBI agent ever act undercover and give somebody a potential drive like that if\nThey weren't investigating the public official about the only reason you would do such a ...\nOf course nobody knows the peace in the clear now are not nobody knows if this is an ongoing investigation of among other people and him\nOh it's it's it's definitely an ongoing investigation and the guy got my kids were there um it's interesting we re ran an ad uh basically uh talking about all this problem\nAnd his attorney wrote a cease and desist letter to the station and then the letter the attorney said a public reports have said that\nIs not the subject of the investigation but as you know mark some of these bugs words you can be a subject of an investigation you can also be a target of the investigation his own campaign attorney\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said he under that subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission uh because the bottom line is\nWhy would they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agent around him on these trips like they were on\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nSo if if you like a compendium if you would like a a book that just gives you a great overview with a

first twelve callers call up\nAnd it's yours is on the way eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine now in the final minutes here we want to talk about if you want retirements security\nHad to make a plan for everything that could possibly go wrong taught the subject\nOf our show today is the fact that things are changing it's time to rebuild your portfolio and think of it all whether\nAm I comfortable my confident that no matter what happens in this world or I'm going to be okay if the stock market crash of my position properly you need to be all weather and so that's where a retirement security or investment security's going to come from is really important and you know remember make a plan for everything that could pass\nAnd go wrong Murphy's law do you know about Murphy's law we talked about in the book is it is a chapter in my book you know Murphy was a Airforce engineer and he was doing a test or a crash tests on airplanes to see what our body can withstand\nAnd his assistant wired all the sensors backwards he did 'em all backwards and he walks away shaking his head and says you know whatever can go wrong will go wrong\nAnd it became he was captain Murphy became Murphy's law whatever can go wrong will go wrong so think about the things that can go wrong I mean what can possibly go wrong maybe a stock market crash\nOr or maybe you're getting the wrong financial advice that might go wrong and think about all that stuff on what's billed as bulletproof plan\nWell we're already seeing inflation inflation I Know you've told me this forever Bob that inflation is probably the most overlooked piece of investment strategy\nI specially with a giant debt and no one's talking about what's in our politicians aren't talking about this but our government does an enormous amount of money on our behalf that was our money that they wasted but trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars\nAnd if that doesn't get handled properly it's gonna ruin the stock market is going to create inflation\nIs going to create all kinds of problems so what can go wrong might go wrong right it just might be Murphy's law I mean who knows and so the wise thing to do as as investors is take the long term view and you simply say\nI Want to get a check up I Want to make sure I'm doing the right thing and I want to try to do better I Want to see if there's a better way to do things that I'm doing it right now\nAnd as you do that you start thinking about all the things that might keep you up at night and then when you come in for your meeting with me or wherever you go for your view\nA you simply say that person this is what bothers me is or anything we can do to fix these problems I'm worried about another two thousand eight and I lose my job and I lose half my money uh I'm worried about if I ever need a nursing home\nLong term care a lot of my clients are parents have been through this and some of them we've helped through this by using some they called health care writers we talk about these in our book healthcare writers that a lot of you all don't know about that might help you through these hard things\nAnd so we want to make sure that we're thinking about all those things that keep you up at night and then what if we can build a bullet proof plan for your financial strategy that says that even if these things happen\nI'm going to be okay I can get through this is not going to be a big deal how much better would you feel about your finances and the stock market and this crazy politics going on how much better would you feel knowing that what you worked so hard for you've created\nIs invested or are done in a way that can whether multiple storms\n[noise] another thing Bob and this has come up a whole lot on the program is the fear of running out of money and that's something that you you counsel people on and this is all part of the strategy because this is one of the biggest greatest fear is that people have\nHere yet they retire and they're going to run out of money and they're going to get a victim they're going to be a ... cat food from all your dollar store you know\nIt's also subtitled a book about safer tournament the ultimate guide to not now on the auto body right I live in your body so the book talks about how to do this will teach you it's an even if you have pensions and guaranteed income and this or that\nYou still want to think about all those things that can do the rail your plan and we can't plan for everything just do the best you can but we should know you did the best you can what I see is people with a bunch of of the vestments their advisors I think sometimes are more focused on the golf game than their clients needs\nAnd you want to make sure that what you're doing is the right thing because the market is changing is challenging there's a big problem out there\nAnd we don't know when the next correction is going to come so make sure you're doing everything the right way\n[noise] folks it is so easy it's so simple and I mentioned this a lot because it's important and it's true\nPeople that meet with Robert Harward and

E. V. I. and free Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nNot ladies and gentlemen I I have a solution for this uh they called a caravan\nThis invasion that's taking place I have a solution I posted up on Facebook and is this\nThe a prime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau chip off the old man's block Trudeau has set in the past say we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants\nFrom all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who were trying to come into the country illegally\nA solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do\nPresident United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got\nSeven to fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's where we are going to do when I get a whole bunch of greyhound buses\nAnd we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico does it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico or we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses\nAnd will drive them to our northern border and won't let them out because Canada wants them\nThese people want to leave they ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume there how halls\nEven though they're carrying their flags\nAnd in the United states this president believes in law and order and enforcing immigration laws so there you have your satisfy all three\nThe illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving there how halls Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea Mr produce\nAnd on top of that\nLook at greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use\nSo that's my solution ladies and gentlemen for the caravan ha a parade of illegal immigrants who are coming into our country supported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states\nFunding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth but here we can accommodate everybody\n\nOK well use Hoover too I don't care if we can use ... you can use taxis greyhound\nWhatever I'm not particular about these things [noise]\nWhat Mr producer my call screeners down why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we have a limited number two if not if we have a regular American\n\nMike in Maryland the great WMA out go\nHey Margaret talking to you I'm color or anything else on the war rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed that some things to push the buttons to push the guy but with that\nUm you know the first time where supporters of the other candidates have been directly or ... or attacked and attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they pick the five and then there are five\nAnd ... that's my point is you know they're going back and forth but it's a it's the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it showed ... too I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that is the borders of the Democrats the way that the Democrat\nArm burglaries and so for that we actually to believe\n\nThat the political rhetoric causes these things I mean seriously ladies and gentlemen this guy has a a long crime record including threatening to use a bomb and two thousand to multiple felonies\nAnd we get played all the time by the media really by the left more more more generally played all the time well if the president we keep down has written has nothing to do with the president\nAnd as I pointed out in exquisite detail for the last forty eight hours\nIt's the president who's called Hitler it's the president who's called a Nazi it's\nHis supporters us\nWho are called neo Nazis and racist it's the president who's called a racist and he's called a racist and Nazi on MSNBC\nOr CNN by the late night host which is really truly appalling absolutely appalling\n\nAnd then they tell you know we got to tone down here toned down immediately out of the box sucker who's responsible for CNN\nPuts out a statement without knowing anything blaming Trump\nJake Tapper such a fool he goes on the air like John Harris I think that was me they go on there and say what Trump said stop blaming him who\nBlaming him what do you mean it was blaming ham all of you idiots are blaming him your network I
