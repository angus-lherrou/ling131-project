there's a race for the Senate Mississippi it's not talked about much outside of Mississippi and there's a gentleman running who I've always been a big fan of and his name is Chris McDaniel and he's running for the Senate and Mississippi how are you sir\nI Am great mark thank you for having me so\nWell it's my pleasure and explain to everybody in the nation as well as in Mississippi how this particular election works\nWell it's a special election you might recall going into the fourteen I rather just forty one year income but by the name of bad Cochran we'll begin Mr cook with the first night\nHe came back out any scared forty thousand Democrats with a Republican primary and they ... well I remember that yes they are just like your status but does they'd been tied a senator Cochran stepping down perfectly so they get hair select\nThe next senator from the ... were so happy to be a lifetime Democrat Hillary Clinton supporter but when they looked at the high risk so they appoint hurting perversion and now that means we're in a special race\n... that term so for people in the race non harvest that he has no parties declared the what happens if the top to advance to a three week well after November\nBut the bottom line here mark here we are again for the average by conservative person who's the same old machine this car going to take them out\nWhy would the governor Brian I Believe his name is why would he appoints somebody who's been a lifelong Democrat who voted\nFor Hillary Clinton who ... more recently became a Republican why would he appointed to the Senate\nWell Mark I think this may surprise with your listeners but Mitch McConnell doesn't like me very much and I don't like she'll very much either so then then Mitch McConnell met with the governor\nAnd hit the structure to the governor were anyone\nBut McDaniel so sure enough they hold all the statewide against me and they didn't work out very well so they finally found this one person who didn't help much name id the thought process was despite the fact that she was a lifetime Democrat\nWe cannot pointer we could raise a whole bunch of money we can find or as a Republican even though she has been and she may have a great chance to win so that's why it was Mitch McConnell hand selected or this person at the beer the appointee\n[noise] you know I Know ah there's a lot of my conservative brothers and sisters out there who are now think the world of Mitch McConnell I Do not\nI think what he did in the case of Kevin was something that any Republican leader must do and should have done if they can't deliver\nA a Supreme Court position or when they control the majority in the Senate I don't care how small the majority is a that would have sank the Republican Party for a decade in my view now having said that\nIt's actually more than that you were a constitutional conservative explain your views\nWell I'll go all the way back I was the state's lawyer against Obamacare I represented the lieutenant governor and ten other petitioners against Obamacare but here my physicians\nAre I guess outlet outlines for you I I Believe strongly that the constitution I'm an originalist orientation I've I've read your book men in black and understand the power of the court in the bottom line here is we've got to find people that can construed the document as originally intended\nAnd that means rejecting this a Libyan constitution nonsense that's pushed by the likes of Kennedy and uh certainly or and the like\nWe need to find more skill is more a Clarence Thomas's more individuals like Gorsuch that can stand the student is talking about the way it was meant to be\nWhat that means definitely is the federal government is way too large it's do it way too much

to you again in just a matter of minutes Bob final segment the final quiz question and I got to be honest I I think this is probably the most important question because\nIt was a delineated you and your team from a lot of the others out there\nYeah I'm going to say you know the question is are all advisors created equal true or false so we know they're not all equal we know there's a big difference but the point I Want to make that's really important to our listeners there's about three hundred thousand maybe three hundred fifty thousand\nQuote unquote financial advisors in this country and the majority of them are brokers and a broker you know it's a car brokers sells cars a house brokers sales houses and the stockbrokers cells stocks and these people are commissioned driven\nA very small segment of the population of advisors are actually that do Sherry's produced Sherri\n... is not a salesperson of food do Sherrie is someone as required by law to watch over their client's best interest there to watch over to protect you had to make sure you're getting the right kind of advice there not commission houses that are going to go on commissions Everytime you\nChange a stock or a mutual fund or whatever is they're selling you they're produced Sherry's and so you want to work with the reduced sharing now here's the problem\nA censored but so much news about the producer and how important it is a lotta stockbrokers are getting what's called duly license there are still the stock broker\nBut they go get their producer devices and they can choose when they're sitting with you whether they want to be for sure that day or a salesperson that day\nWhere they're going to earn a commission or the it's terrible taught it's really a bad deal that sounds like a chameleon it is a chameleon so be careful a lot of these people that are seeing their produce Sherry's in the Tampa Bay area across the country well they may have taken the fiduciary test but they're also a stockbroker they're called ... says\nYou know the lesson Thirteen percent of financial advisors are just for ... like we are we're fiduciary advisors were not stockbrokers we don't have those licenses we don't do that stuff at my company\nHey let me let me get a check for a second here because again as the radio talk show host Taj in it and you know the lay person I just want to make sure the folks understand that\nThe ... Sherry label the fact that Robert Harward and his team are for do Sherry's meaning the in the entire from from the inception of the from\nFrom years and years ago you built the from you open the door you laid the bricks originally as a fiduciary from which folks it means that they must by law they have to act in your best interests and what happens with stockbrokers\nA lotta times stockbrokers or something with these these dual roles\nA lot of times they're acting in their own best interest or the company or the company for what he worked for the the big wall street from the the brokerage that they work for by pushing products or you know the morning meeting that they had before they start talking to their clients are what Sachs we pushing today\nOr you know what what how many shares the move and then when a free trip somewhere I mean that's not what we're dealing with with the Harwood financial group you're dealing with a company that is legally charged with acting in your best interests\nI I'd go to Todd ... rules and important one it didn't pass as a law but you as a consumer our listeners\nCan insist on it I think that's very important\nAh in my book I have a whole chapter on how to find the right advisor questions to ask and how to know if they're produced Sherry so if you want to get a copy of our book there's a whole chapter in there or when you come in and sit with me and you bring me the statements from whatever you're doing what they're doing it yourself or your current advisor\nI'll be able to look at it and tell you is there for their shares or not and I can tell you also that if in my opinion whether they're doing a good job for you as a\nJust a great opportunity kind of two or maybe get everything looked at maybe a little spring cleaning I Know it's not spring as the other end of the world\nBut but the answer is is that you want things looked over you want to make sure you're doing the right thing and what's wrong with coming in and getting a second opinion on your finances and get a copy of her book because I have a whole chapter on producer advisors and how to know if your advisor is true if we do share your\nBubble give out the number again and just a second here but it is common place that people will go get a second or even a third opinion in\nMedical issues people will get another doctors' opinion many times that's been commonplace to get a second opinion\nWhy wouldn't you want to get a second opinion on your finances what if you're a moving in the wrong direction what if the trajectory of your investment strategy is incorrect\nYou know corrected before it's too late\nHow do you find out if it's incorrect in how to you or fix it before it has to like you get the second opinion and you meet with the horror would team\nAnd all you do is call eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine now I don't want you to be intimidated here I Want you to you know I understand it as a you know me as a talk show host or you know a Bob Harward from the years that we've done this show together\nIt is not an intimidating process in fact it's a very relaxing process and you're going to feel better\nBy just making the call and the heart what team they're standing behind the falls right now the grab your name they'll set up an appointment with you at your convenience and it's simply a phone call to weigh\nEight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine\nAnd you call up and say I'm listening to the radio show can I get that second opinion can I meet with you for my complete planning review and the answer is absolutely yes also the book\nQuickly here if you didn't call up for a copy of the book or if you want both\nEight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine say hey I Want to copy of Robert heart was book it's a must read folks that she'll be on everyone's bookshelf eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine the website when at\nRetirement dot com and we'll see you next time [noise]\nTo find out more about financial advisor Robert Harward and the hard way call Harwood financial at one eight hundred three nine five\nFour to seven one eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine for online at the Harwood way dot com [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe proceeding\nWas a commercial program paid for by Harwood financial the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporate a dot com\nBoom west helpful\nOn our first are ready to go after\nThe investigation heats up into a series of mailbox we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible\nThe entire family has received white powder in the mail I was in August\n\nAnd there's others Marco Rubio can't remember them all\nIt's just hard to to to ignore the fact that all these examples I gave you before\nIt ... wasn't that they were downplayed it was that they weren't really covered in any several way where they\nAll these packages going to the Trump family all these packages going to the Pentagon Madison so forth are to Rubio or other members here and they're\nNot ... I'm not trying to make anything of this I'm just saying the coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't in Mr ... there was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump Ford incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of these things\nThe president was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\n\nSo there's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said I told you yesterday that I could see and together we could see how the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's fully open\nIt's fully open\nThat Trump's words in Trump's rallies in Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first to the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things and the president\nDoes than any politician does\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I were to submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute area just spend an hour talking about it\nYou can download it so you can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't really know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we have thousands of radio stations scores of radio companies why do we need a government run radio company where the hosts are overpaid and they have no ratings\nThey don't live by ratings or die by ratings like anybody else you know competition for them it's government radio whatever government radio and a free society for but anyway\n\nSo we have these rights and attacks against Republican senators Susan Collins right after she voted for cabinet other threats\nPositive for rice and sent to Madison the or the the chief for the navy center the president of the United states white powder set the members of the president's family I really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about\nWhite powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\nNow\nWhy does all this matter it matters because the media are out there trying to determine\nWho politically should benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque good\n\nAnd of course it's Trump Trump's to blame about Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything\nNow I Want to um play a montage for you on this pathetic\nProgram on MSL or stay in the morning show and Mr ... you're going to hear and make it but you're also going to hear a never Trump or probably denies he's the never Trump or John ...\n\nYou're going to hear him a couple of times you also hear Steve Rattner Susan do her CEO whoever the hell that is John Heilemann high adamant Hi Hi I'm In any way a\nAnd I want you to listen to this because it is it is really appalling what takes place on this so called that were cut five go\nBut I hear now in my heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric that\nLaid it all off and now that of all that top Democrats in the navy I Would think targeted this is an unusual for the ... go ahead\nFor the reasons that it is their way in terms of the president's rhetoric saw stock market\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense ...\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot\nOr like Jay moron in some sense ... the you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys over commentary written much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner go ahead\n... costs us I think we have a right or if it were kind of rhetoric we've had this guy over and over again\nThis is a private life is called the media the enemy of the people and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people in their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot and the federal judge was murdered I remember that ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings have kids in elementary schools and there's the media\nAnd then you are of course the enemy of the people of course we're not the enemy of the people well what the hell are you really what are you what are you doing tonight what did you do this morning what did you do yesterday\nIt's appalling [laughter]\nGo ahead or whatever we
