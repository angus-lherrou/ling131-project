you it's an honor to be on your program\nWell it's a great pleasure hey every three years come hell or high water not just in any way you guys are always very kind to me over at Fox and friends and we very much appreciate that\nWell you're part of the family you're part of the Fox family when you're not part of your radio family you're busy guy\nI got a lot of families my brother anyway uh no that's true or by the way your son is a terrific journalist I mean he is a real journalists Disney\nYou know he really is um some people will say hey you know Steve your ah your son is better than you because he just gives the news that it's like wait I I used to do the news and now I'm kind of an opinion guy so I that's a great complement\nYou always want people to say that don't you about your own kids I mean yeah that means you very successful you and your beautiful white Catholic now and when I talked about a few things here okay if people are gonna think this is interesting or unusual\nThe breaking news which isn't news at all this massive long hit on Donald Trump and his father and his family on taxes which is really another set up for the Democrats they've been chomping at the bit on this but I Want to start with something else you have a brand new cookbook\nHappy ... ... ... you and your wife\nWell you know what mark there's a there's a a a connection to the uh the Trump story and that is according to the New York times Trump and his family going way back I have been cooking\nThe books and oh look all about cooking and [laughter]\nYou know life is too short and what did I just hear from somebody they said you know politics or transitory but food is forever and ah my wife and I for the last I don't know three or four years have been writing a cookbook\nOr with the foods that make America happy because the alternative when a couple of years ago\nMy wife started to realize wait a minute why do I even ask you what you want for your birthday meal because I Know it's you want me to make your mom's pot roast you know the one with the Lipton onion soup and the ... mushroom soup you cook\nIt all day and she makes a a a German chocolate cake and when I Walk in the house mark after she's been cooking at all day it just brings a smile to my face because it immediately transports me back to\nYou know fifty years in reverse suddenly I'm eight years old again I'm I'm In that little house on Margaret street in Russell, Kansas and\nA happy place and everybody it seems that who I've talked to has a happy food I asked Dr oz I said you know I figured this was a kale something but as it turns out it's a it's a German chocolate cake or Sean Hannity or I asked him what he liked and he said\nAll the foods corn beef and cabbage and the ... you know here's a guy he could have steak every meal um but I happen to know that's not true well he eats steak every damn meal that I happen to know as a matter of fact but anyway go ahead [laughter] really does but here's the\nThing he loves a corn beef and cabbage because that's what he used to make when he was like twelve years old and a or Thirteen Years old when he worked out at that Norwood in where he was a short order cook\nA for years making like a two Seventy five an hour you got to make that and lobster and steaks and he he learned how to cook and when he\nWants a Happy Meal he will go and he will boil up a corn beef and cabbage and so anyway we we put together a bunch of the stories of of ah people and they're happy foods and they're sweet stories a lot of them are really funny and uh we put it together came out today it's doing great\nA happy cookbook let me ask you then to make America small\nIt's a great the happy cookbook and we have it up on march ... get it on Amazon any major bookstores but it is it's a nice you know diversion from all the stuff that's going up but I didn't know you know Greg Norman\nGreg Norman ah actually just between you and me yes my wife and I spend a lot of time down or in the Jupiter, Florida area\nNow and don't give away your address for God's sakes\nNo no Jupiter, Florida is large yes I'm ... and so I we have met a Greg Norman through Fox and friends and uh you know we'll go down there every once in a while and he's got a little golf course it will play out and have very nice guy and one of his recipes isn't the cookbook and\nTodd that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right so if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars which is what I estimate and that's a really good thing\nYou still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a pool you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plan unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there and big debt out there or that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam keep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just the classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with the horror with team they loved to help people they loved to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide let the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls is what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine\nAnd just say I'd love to come in and meet the Harwood team and get that second opinion on your portfolio\nBob Let's also dive into\nOne of the side how did people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nThat's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's still in his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done said eight out of ten of Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is they're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough\nYou know he he wants to do radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years it's just fine with you I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do and what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire road map\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just helped me he said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need to use that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving enough\nYou don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my job is to make you more financially successful they are today right isn't that simple\nAnd when you call for your CPR your plan to review with me you want to sit down with me and and meet and just talk a little bit and warned for me I'm going to show you how to get your finances on track\nAnd if you're on track I'll show you how to make them better and you're going to be better off because of the time was spent together so if you have a cold and if you're one of those listeners haven't called and yet or or you just feel like you want to do better with your finances you're not doing good enough give me a call it's eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine\nEight hundred three nights by four to seven nine and say hey I listen to Robert I listen to you for a long time and I just want to come in for review or ask for a copy of the book when you call will send you a copy the book as well but\nWhat sit together Robert we only have less than a minute left and all this I've known him for a long time we've been personal friends before we ever put this radio show together you've built an amazing financial practice and I just can't implore\nPeople enough to call your office make the appointment\nIt doesn't cost a penny there's no obligation no one's gonna bug you but for people to come in and just bring in their current investment strategy their current portfolio and just like you look it over and give them a second opinion\nFolks you you're leaving valuable information and a potentially a whole lot of money on the table by not taking Robert Harward up on the offer folks\nIt as a simple phone call eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine say I love the appointment first had callers get the free book investing for retirement best selling on Amazon that Robert ... wrote\nFirst ten callers eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine get the book\nAnd also make the appointment eight hundred

hundred three nice five\nFour to seven one eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine for online the Harwood way dot com\n\n\nBoom\nBoom boom boom boom boom [noise]\n\nThe proceeding was a commercial program paid for by Harwood financial the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M.\nStaff management or parent company I heart media incorporate\nThese are the same lawyers for Dr Ford who refused to turn it over to the Senate Judiciary committee copies of her therapists notes even though they waived privilege because the therapist notes will tell a lot to the commit\nIncluding whether Dr Ford has other issue which is exactly why the prosecutor asked about them I Want to go back to\nThis prosecuted because it's important the media attack this woman\nRadio hosts attack this woman\nTelevision host attack this one senior judicial\nAnalysts attack this woman I said no no no no she's doing this exactly the right way\nNow I'm going to prove to you that that's the case not just tell you and it's not the pat myself on the back it's because I think you're very intelligent unfortunately most of the media do not but I think you are\nAnd here's what I said I Believe it was the day of that hearing isn't that right rich September twenty seven last Thursday when I came on the air caught one go\nA lot of people have been trashing the ... prosecuted the Republicans hired to ask questions of Ford what was your name again Rachel what Rachel metro I Will take a different view\nI Want to congratulate her she did exactly what needed to be done\nExactly what needed to be done this is why I Believe that in the end Kevin on that will be confirmed\nShe walked Dr Ford through various aspects of her allegation\nAnd what amazed me is some of these cable analysts were unhappy with it it's taking too long the people aren't going to follow this the Democrats are they're making speeches and they thought that was why is there because this is all based on emotion everything let me tell you the problem folks let me tell you the problem\nI'm Sorry to say this but whether it's on cable TV and even this business people really think you're stupid people really don't think you're going to be able to follow these things you're smarter than broadcasters including me whether they're on TV or radio you have a great Sixth Sense about things you've got commonsense\nThose have you watched the hearing you followed everything this prosecutor was doing\nShe was methodically going down raising questions in a very polite and professional way\nAnd showing gaps in Dr Ford's testimony some ... she had absolute recollection but in most cases she had done\nAnd I'm trying to put anybody doubt I'm just saying that's what I saw\nSo I take exception to some out there I I thought she did a hell of a job it was very solid that was her purpose that's what she did that's what she accomplished and she she had to synthesize understand and then use an enormous amount of information a very short time and she did and she found gaps\nAlright that's me from September twenty seventh last Thursday and now virtually everybody's hanging on what she said and they should\nAnd there is even more\nAs the ex boyfriend comes forward noticed the Democrats don't want to talk to the ex boyfriend notice they don't demand that the FBI interview the ex boyfriend notice the Democrats don't demand that the lawyers for a doctor for turned over her therapist notes from twenty ... twenty Thirteen have you noticed that\nI\nNoticed the Democrats don't demand is I've been saying repeatedly that Dr foreigner Laura's go to the Montgomery County police department in Maryland\n\nSo now they're saying the FBI did an interview for it and didn't interview Kavanaugh will of course the FBI didn't interview them you know why this is not a criminal investigation we say this over over over and over again it is not a criminal investigation they already know what Dr Ford has to say how do I know because we all know what Dr\nFord had to say they already know what judge Kavanaugh has to say how do I know because we all know what judge Kavanaugh said\nIt's no different\nThan what it is time to stop trying to rationalize and reason with the Democrats it's time to crush them crush them\nIt's time to defeat them\nStop playing along I don't care if the media play along stop playing along [noise]\nIt's enough already\nIt was enough a week ago it was enough when it started

what exactly did he say did he say something worse than the Democrats are upset about cabinet\nDid he say something in a way that was more outrageous than Saturday Night live want to do a cabinet or\n\nDid he make a fabricated accusation like the multiple fabricated accusations that have been made about Kavanaugh\n\nWell I listen to what the president said and you know what it was very mild

Kevin ... and the Kavanaugh girls to be hurt anybody concerned about them on the Democratic side not one person\nNot one person\nAnd where to believe everything Dr cabinet as a doctor or a Ford says I found a very credible and I I don't find a credible\nDot in terms of er accusations against Kavanaugh I find the opposite and so does the woman prosecutor who questioned her and so to all the women around me in my life\nThey don't believe it either\nAnd they trash\nAnd they they degrade\nAnd they vilify and they all lie about Kavanaugh\nSugar thing about the Ford touched I'm Wondering [laughter] she's the bubble lady you're not allowed to say we're not\nAnd they create this environment\nThat this is really about women who've been molested no it's not\nNot in the least the Democrats aren't talking about\nJuanita Broderick Democrats\nAre talking about Kathleen Willie or Paula Jones or the hundreds if not thousands had been molested by the Kennedys and the Clintons in it no no no no\nIt's not about all women who had been molested\nAbout one woman making accusations against one man and the woman's accusations don't hold up if you are rational and relatively objective about the facts\nThey don't hold I\nIn fact they don't even make sense\nOr you must be not attacking anybody the left does not get but tell us who we are and what we think and the finest ladies and gentleman

exclusive photos for the first time since news of Ford named her Kaiser showed the stress of being put into the national spotlight\nThe closest relative expressed anger at Ford suggestion the Kaiser cannot recall the party because of the quote significant health challenges and why aren't the media all worked up about how Dr Ford through a fellow female Leland Kaiser under the bus\nShe can't
