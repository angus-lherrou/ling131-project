three points higher\nThan Brock Obama's three points higher now imagine this for\nA president with Ninety two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet [noise]\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most in for those that are most engaged [noise]\nIt it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know [noise] but you can't lie to them about what is or is it in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll of the lives that were thrown out there where perpetuated wild that whole deal is going down\nIt was guarantee not dorky was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that we know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep\nYour doctor and all the rest of that [noise] so people understood as soon as they had to pay for it [noise] we're in a\nSimilar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage law folks get upset about the way things are portrayed [noise] but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think they have\nIf they had the type of impact in elections\nThat many will still assume they have there is no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nMedicare for all its financial broad what the president was pointing out there the eight hundred billion over ten years that's diverted here is what actually happened to Medicare he's a hundred percent right it's not a political talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius\nTo pick up on a couple of points real quickly and here's the first one if\nWe already are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nNow here's the deal Corning to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is\nTwenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in your one nine percent of Medicare benefits to portray gone first year nine percent Medicare\nAnd it gets worse every year from their apparently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it\nA hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick\nFifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years\nWhen we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nIt is financial fraud is bigger than Bernie Madoff\nYeah you as a political party that's perpetuating it in Florida\nWe've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it financial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nYou're not paying attention to board has given the joy of race\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist when's\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you\nOne of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this and this was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans will replace Rick Scott\nWho was term limited and running for the Senate Andrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians ...\nYou will have the most liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and he got well that sucks to be you and for to know it sucks to be you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take boys Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats in our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode a wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination would just thirty four percent of the vote\nThat was enough to get through what's happened is\nThey nailed consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check so noisy or Michael Bloomberg felt like he is the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this race ... is critical and again there is one platform piece in particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic we're talking about the governor's race because we'll Medicare federal program that doesn't really matter Andrew Gillum has also run an impeachment President Trump\nA kid you not that's part of what's going on here now this is why it's important to educate is why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nThree months free

things that was one of those ah [laughter]\nIt just happened moments ... in the grand scheme of the media kind of losing his mind everybody had to point out what a tiny have Ibota password is which job zeroes [laughter] so anyway that was a that was an interesting moment ... but again you know when you've got\nThe the dragging energy and you've got your maggot Superman out on things happen you know it's really hard to get on a channel all of that and and you got to you know every now and that you're going to have a hydrogen I\nI play and that the president or the president [laughter]\nI was talking earlier you one of my one of my all time favorite reactions Michael Meyers\nWatching Kanye do the Katrina really like where is\nThe exit button on this stage right now how can I get off of here now please\nAnd ah you know one of those moments but President Trump is like okay what do I do hear you talk about role reversal because he's usually that people may person making people dumped trouble but you gotta gotta feeling that for once he got a dose of his own a kind of thing there\nAnyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's not complicated and and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike argument you have\nA Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pasted insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent a hundred percent of folks do work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when you put the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that\nIs the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country and it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is perpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by the NRA sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational year but here's something else\nThat is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person that take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody why haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a at a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any adjustments either their employers didn't they didn't the tax cuts\nSo it's all going to be reconciled when they filed their taxes but they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody's uh I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything\nNow\nThe next part that fraud comes in with companies you hear how awful it cuts are because evil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the evil corporations they're using it to buy back all stock and you know do what rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know about that stuff except that that's\nA fraud as well as dishonest to its ally the a C B say you know the the vast right wing media CNBC\n[noise] bad the CFO capsule and they get research from them constantly on what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts CNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way who has been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not the personal the corporate tax cuts\nThis year buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone through a combination of bonuses and employee racist\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrade\nSoftware five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated information only by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility in the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary\nLiability into a line of defense ... barracuda dot com slash piano to learn more\n... a pretty

H. Gen Z [noise]\n\nOff and make you feel like Superman who made a\nA favorite here or not\nWe're going to be on it have you want\nIt [laughter]\n[noise] you know some of the things that you didn't necessarily know specifically we're going to happen with Donald Trump is president but hey you know there were some moments that would be a little bit differently go a and yes you have the fame to outrage the the moral folks in the media that are\nAll my gosh the profanity Twenty years Twenty years removed\nFrom the oval office equally a blue dress [noise] Kanye West using profanity and the oval office is somehow or another Twenty years later\nJust reprehensible but the president you know\nDoing a little Lewinsky thing that yeah that was okay\nActually part of the Nineteen Ninety eight ... mid term election\nThat whole impeachment effort which is interesting because really the number of different comparisons you can actually make between that mid term cycle in this one but are they talking about some of the misinformation out there the fraud that is\nMedicare for all talked about how much more money we're really making that take home pay up six point seven percent year over year\nAnd then you get into this recent study that was really just mind numbing it's why we have the broad being perpetuated that is Medicare for all survey\nRepublicans believe us economic system is fair to most Americans Democrats don't came out earlier this week Republicans believe us economic system is fair to most Democrats do\nHere's the irony of all this success not exactly being partisan getting guy you know is not exactly you're right wing Republican conservative type\nBut guess who else is like all of your richest self made people in this country for a few names of the richest Americans for\n... pesos Warren Buffett Mark Zuckerberg Bill Gates\nYou happened to notice a trend here\nTo ease once again two sides histories one side effects so why is it\nWith the rich as the most successful the wealthiest individuals in this country actually bean\nLeft to use that most Democrats feel the euro us economic system isn't fair\nGets back to what I pointed out earlier this hour sixty percent of adults being financially illiterate\nBut here's the more important point and this is another shutdown argument if you want it you'll have people talked about how much more fair it is elsewhere well guess what the media and world per capita income\nIs ten thousand two hundred Ninety eight bucks\nAnd the United states you can even regularly work fulltime and earn less than sixteen thousand dollars a year since the minimum wage in the United states which as I pointed out a little bit ago only point six percent the population orange is approximately sixty percent higher than the median income around the world\nSo to all the folks who say that our economic system isn't fair\nNobody's keeping your ear to let's go to Ryan in California Ryan go\nHey uh as soon as the tax uh\nThing went through I've paid attention to my paychecks and\nRight when it went through I notice thirty dollars more and I went to all of my co workers where I work at a Bush\nAnd all those guys are like well I've got thirty and so it was like thirty to thirty five bucks the federal government wasn't taking away from me so those crumbs that Nancy Pelosi was talking about actually makes a difference\nBut she wants the drums Batman she wants her crumbs back but I have a fight\n[laughter] good stuff Bridget Ryan once again you get a lot of people [noise] about what they don't know [noise] but you can't lie to people\nAbout what is more isn't in their wallet\nAs Ryan just pointed out to be right back talking about the broad that is the un climate ... and for the gray one Margot that\nArt radio when they were helpful\nYou along and listen bought our first I our radio ads [noise] downloading\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by zoom video conferencing\nHave Allison Keyes the death toll from hurricane Michael stands at sixteen but that may rises search and rescue crews had deeper into Florida's panhandle tonight that's where this man lives to\nIt's very difficult to obtain that kind of information right now\nBecause of this insurance first model there is not a much in the line of of consumer price transparency as you noted even looking for it and you're having trouble finding it it is extremely difficult there are a a smattering of health care facilities often not those that are involved in providing major surgery\nThat will provide some rice transparency it's part of the importance in breaking the back of this model\nIf we did then you would have everybody that would have to compete on a service and outcome type of model just like we do with everything else is why you know I make the analogy to all their insurance products in our lives\nIf you end up having a you know a a minor\nIssue what your car you go to a mechanic you get it fixed you can shop around you can see what mechanics or reliable which ones do you feel good about see what things cost\nAnd make that decision if you get into a significant accident or you end up filing an insurance claim probably just looking for a good body shop at your insurance company will go and work with right you're not doing as much shopping there\nSo the first thing you know even if we can get to this place are going to be some exceptions\nI don't imagine they'll ever be a good time to be shopping for\nBest price when you're having to go to the emergency room for some major medical a bit right uh so that would be in a moment where it wouldn't necessarily apply there might be\nSome other major surgeries to where it wouldn't necessarily apply I mean they were talking major surgeries complications that you don't even know about it until you get in there are so I you know there are some of these things will never be solved a by being able to say oh okay well this has everything I Need medically and here's the price\nBut again for all the basics\nIt would provide that level of transparency and that's kind of the the more important point generally but to your specific situation\nAgain I I feel for you and and I wish you the best and I hope that you can find a some providers nearby that would be able to assist you they can't provide some level of transparency what I have done and I'll tell you that it's not always the most popular thing and it's not necessarily\nA something that always comes with an answer\nBut I Will ask people in my wife's got good at this to ask you how much is this going to cost and it can lead to the health care provider kind of running in circles\nAnd every now and then you won't get an answer I have actually not obtained healthcare in in some instances because they couldn't tell me how it's something was going to cost\nI won't necessarily just signed a piece of paper that says hey whatever happens in here\nI'm going to pay for I don't provide any of them my Social Security number because they don't have a right to it so in that context you can ask hey here's my situation what am I looking at\nAnd hopefully there are some providers that might be able to provide you with at least some guidance on that type of information but again not God Bless them\nAnd best wishes to you and if anybody comes through some specific information make sure that uh you're you're a information there uh we uh we have it and I can get in touch with you I'm All right so\nSwitch gears here for a moment\nAway from health care over to another major fraud by the way as we are getting into the climate talks are going on who is this guy it's clearly not the gray one no you're right and I'm more like the little one\nI Am [laughter] I ... I I Do a morning show W. J. you know in West Palm Beach and humid morning show on W. I. O. D. in Miami and are always a pleasure and an honor to be here with you and filling in for the gray one\nAnd or you can catch me I Wonder have probably ... radio and I live on some principals suicides histories one side effects\nI operate on the premise I Will never accept a false one and I will assert that anything that's built upon the false premise\nIs destined to fail and also that I have talked about the sliding scale of morality I think it helps explain a lot of what goes on in our everyday life how some people can seem like they're good people in good times and then turn around and stab us in the back\nOr in this particular case how we now have the political party that's basically embraced\nA lack of morality to where they are willing to be dishonest and lie about major issues that would impact every American Life the fraud that is Medicare for all for example and then have people buy into the political party that will perpetuate a series of of lies and deceit like Christine Ford in I Believe her\nAs Chuck Schumer and Feinstein and many Democrats did because then their constituents bullied them creating\nMajor segment of this country that embraces a lack of morality and a lack of honesty lack of integrity and decency but we also have\nWith climate stuff\nAnd the un ah the the bless the usa\nBy the way Nikki Haley was about the only thing good at the un\nAnd now she's heading now\nHow many people would necessarily miss it if we we did just go ahead and say well I got to subsidize the Oregon subsidize the UN and man that is a fine real estate in Manhattan and we happen to have a president knows a thing or two about Manhattan real estate anything\nAnyway er here is a headline and the specter that was brilliantly done\nGood news we now have until twenty thirty to save the earth\nIs there's an excerpt from the specter story according to the I. P. C. C. report we now have twelve years to avert climate catastrophe\nThat might not sound long but it means we're good deal further away from doomed than we were in two thousand seven when the WWF said we have five years to save the world\nThe doomsday clock hadn't moved in two thousand eleven when the international Energy Agency ward now we would have five years to start slashing carbon emissions or lose the chance for ever\nBy last year it is Jordan to three years according to Christina figures the executive secretary of the un framework convention on climate change but now it's right up at twelve years presumably maintain that we can pretty much ... ... or or thumbs until twenty thirty a whole Eighteen years\nAfter the WWF told us the world would come to an end if we didn't slash carbon emissions\nTheir tongue in cheek approach to pointing out how disingenuous dishonest and wrong the United nations has been\nFunny thing is sunspots you know [noise] so that went away and then what did it become ... global warming only got global warming for many years Frank\nAnd then ... not buying it to go from global cooling we go from the ozone layer to global warming\nTo something that actually Israel does something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we'd had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat we've had a minimum of three mass extinction event\nRemarkably enough before we were even on this planet it must have been all like the the dinosaur watch what do you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more polluting than than like a you know cars\nSo if you just had if you think about it as the pita crowds to really think about this for a moment if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens\nYou care more about the the ...\nOr do you care about uh you know your your climate change there because they got you know we're more cows what's gonna happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this [noise] so anyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of ... and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a mass\nExtinction events that are just you know following all the logic to its natural conclusion you say\n[noise]\nOnce you get two sides to stories one side effects [noise]\nI joined backs and will

election in Florida by five twenty two and Eighteen points and\nScott right now is in a statistical tie it's kind of unfortunate ... he's even ... been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way ah I'm Brian mud in for Marco then by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida\nQuite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got you know a little bit of weather but uh nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you are what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas they give you an idea and the comparison real quick a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your head and one of the things that\nI ended up noticing when we were taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael a lot of pictures that looked an awful lot\nLike what we saw with Hurricane Andrew heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado or this you know in hurricanes\nA lot of people put the focus on the category and the tops of St when very rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them\n... about almost anything but the when just says you solve with Florence and the Carolinas just as you saw with Harvey\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes\nRarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew was about the when\nWhen you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about\nA hurricane that around its core is a tornado\nTo give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the F five tornadoes go right\nOn top sustained winds at a hundred and fifty five miles an hour hurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an ass three tornado I'm very fortunate my ... my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I was saying I Am I got my parents and my sister and my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast on south eastern Florida\nUm I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through toward some of the power lines near us\nThey were out power for like going to the actually the or better where Hurricane Irma truck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother in Panama City beach is all of the reporters through Michael Dell run PC beach give me an idea and he will as a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we're talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a tornado\nBut there's something else that it was kind of a an important and the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be a long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI uh I had an idea there is one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nAnd affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures in Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped out nothing but debris and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look at the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before those standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
