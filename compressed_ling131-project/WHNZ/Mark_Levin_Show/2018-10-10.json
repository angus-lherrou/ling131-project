{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer\nHillary Clinton and the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November ... remember the eight twenty sixteen better mental and might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election [noise]\nAren't haven't they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse worse\nBecause they are determined you can see the devotion and dedication to things that do not bring his country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as the sec\nHow about accepting the results of the election\nWhether it's the Russian collusion delusion or what whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should resign as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama\nBut what happened is that that uh one Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amyloid abnormalities I say let's have more of it if the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more but if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected\nThe trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they rip dissolve for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nWell every name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I I think what happened Jeannie in reality\nIs that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor you are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help for your problem so if tomorrow Jeannie you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting\nThe doctor believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist has that Christine for dinner and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys who tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that\nHappened I Believe something fundamentally bad happen to Christine Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years and probably what she told the therapist\nIncentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys try do rape her in her late teens and the Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties it became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes and I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold a therapist who rented a room in our house\nThat caused sort of put the second front door in our house so patience could come in and out of her house she accurately\nTold the therapist six years ago that four boys tried to rape me in the in my late teens and\nThe Nineteen eighties then\nSome out in her mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys you said it was one instead of late teens I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University and she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime\nDying Feinstein's office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them require her to come forward and won the Senate said\nWhen the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened [noise]\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers were so perfect\nFor um her responses drew out I'm feeling some sympathy they were absolutely perfect I'm Jamaican on her side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of a witness that you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue but this woman probably had something\nHappen in her life ... involving those four boys or tried to write a paper and that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident then damage your life so much she didn't get two master's degrees and a doctorate didn't damage your life so much has not been a teacher for twenty five years\nAt Palo Alto University in Stanford\nAnd and not so bad she isn't written coauthored sixty one books and periodicals what would she would have done Seventy one books that periodicals there's no evidence that affected our life at all in every factual statements you made before the Senate was either falls or purposely ally one or the other\nThey've all been proven not to occur and Gina you're a woman and of course your femininity it's been hijacked by the Democratic party\nDo you want to live in a country where your son your brother\n[noise]\n\n\n\n[noise]\nUse a school board terrifying interactions one location designed just\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower were spot in trouble before it happened when I was telling us to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's my parents' trust blink blink video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home is like having ice everywhere\nBlink cameras or wire free set up and minutes and run on to double A. batteries last up to two years brilliant techno heart radio\nFree from\nHim [noise]\nI'm Ben Adler in the air everywhere and tonight to defy twelve fifty W agency [noise]\n\nShow without warning labels liberals but mark Levin show going on at least seven seven\nThree one one bill\nComing in the great American in for the great when mark has been back out on Monday you know tonight Martha McCalla Fox\nNews's interview Chuck Grassley and he's been privately told by some Democratic senators they may try to impeach Kevin ...\nOf course you can only impeach a federal officer\nFor high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office so he's been in office one day this morning that his first couple hearings and the Democrats already wonder when peach and they don't want to teach them what they want to do is raise money\nTo use an Heidi Heitkamp race in North Dakota for example or Joe Donnelly in Indiana and that's what they want to do they are threatening to impeach when they're never going to do that because it wouldn't fly you need fifty one percent of the of the house and two thirds of the Senate it would never happen\nAnd if ... if there's a God and having the Republicans will keep the Senate for weeks Trump tonight will know better\nThat are so that the federal judges the pipeline can't continue but imagine the absurdity of the modern Democratic Party when having had his first day on the bench\nAnd the Democrats want to impeach Brett Kavanaugh unbelievable let's continue now it's sunny and the great state of Texas where the cowboys can't win Sonny welcome to the mark Kleiman show Sonny please go ahead\nOh of course I'm a ... call ... or ... or ... or ... or ... or ...\n... do the ... the the construction on the go the route of Ku Klux Klan\nWell Sunday you bring up an excellent point you know that the party of the confederacy is\nAnd was the Democratic party they're the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so that Democratic Party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan\nIt's the party of Jim Crow democratic parties the party of lynchings\nThe Democratic party is the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system it's responsible for most of the criminal disasters you see like in the city of Chicago the Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings\nCollapse of public education in fact about eight percent of Detroit or Chicago public school students that are African American read at the appropriate level\nAnd so you're talking about a massive dumbing down of the population to keep them on the modern plantation which is the Democratic party so sunny the blizzard behavior sing from Democrats\nHas been repeat it for the past hundred and fifty or some cold than the demon rats they're not Democrats or the demon rats\nAnd what what we're seeing the restaurants and the and the airports in the elevators today is mild compared to what the Democrats did in the Nineteen sixties burning down about a hundred American cities so I wouldn't put a lot past them because Democrats are now shooting us congressmen other Republican\nSo wherever I look I see the disaster or the modern Democratic Party\nNot covered by the mainstream media sunny do you agree on\nMy son who we got to run thanks for your\nCall his continue with more let's go to Jim in Brooklyn I Love Brooklyn Jimmy in Brooklyn welcome to the Mark Sullivan show Jimmy go ahead\nGreat to hear you again listen when we hear about the radical left the far left we see what's going on in the schools we see the crime you see on TV for this is the result of liberalism now let me give me some quotes from the communist training manuals to communist right\nUse the system to destroy the system the communists right the best way to help the cause of communism is through the liberal wing of the Democratic party the communist right yesterday's left us today center today's left will be tomorrow center that talking about the\nWhole American political system more to the left so they have a highly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist a tactician there are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers there are a lot of our congressmen and senators so what\nDo you see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian pro you see the violence and Ryan spy chief and all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy and let me explain this to you also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional Jeff telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so they organize left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new president he never had a chance to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one [noise]\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this is foreign influence in our government a foreign agent of red China like Congress when Dianne Feinstein she's the one that started this big hoopla about or a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than than numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nIs a he defines mediocre\nYeah that's what ... your likes a spotlight on him\nYou know it is like Chris ... give me an update on the committee chairs\nOkay so you were talking about what happens if the Democrats win and and one thing that I've heard and I wanted to point out is we can't let 'em have how ... how ... ... ... because ah the committee heads have\nSubpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slob Jerry Nadler taking over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nIt would be terrible I mean\nWhat I mean what legislation would pass what what activities on our behalf whatever occur if Jerry ... learn Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are in charge of the house of representatives what positive things would ever go on\nNothing that I could think of it even if we got a new Mueller out of the picture oh jeez they would they would just keeps the painting and keep investigating investigating and it would be nonstop investigations that went out so we ... I Want to encourage everybody to\nDonate all you can do what you came out and cheer volunteer all you can if you can't donate than get they're not yours if you see a sign for you know the the other side the Democrat be as nice as you can go out as you can try to ... ... ... why why you've just curious why you vote for for this person\nBecause the reason yeah because you know there's you know there's plenty of reasons not vote for him and just being is not just in about it but engage them and try to get them to talk a lot of people you know they they're bandwagon fans or whatever that don't really know what they're voting for they're just you know I Want to be part of the crowd so trying to talk\nTo me about ... even ... is that close could Ted Cruz actually lose a Texas Senate seat to a clown like beta O'Rourke is that possible\nUh it is possible I don't think it's going to happen though because um\nYou know they got this Kennedy esque vibe about him you know young and you know he's a you know some people I guess fining physically attractive eight different strokes for different folks whatever but um there's been a lot because Texas economy is so strong we've had so many people moving in from out of Texas\nAnd you know there there's obviously some liberal natives here in Austin area and some other Houston Dallas\nA but most most of Texas is you know pretty normal solidly conservative normal no yeah\nYeah but ah yeah we've got people moving in her changing the demographics and so it's important for everyone to get every vote here in Texas we cannot let cruise blues we've not we've got to have him when\nSee what's happened in Florida is too many New Yorkers have moved to Florida\nAnd they're taking their virus in their cancers ideas with I'm from New York\nFrom the Empire State to the sunshine state they're taking too many New Yorkers are moving in New Jersey I Can't stand the place anymore and moving to Florida so Florida I think is kind of like a purple state at this point\nIs gonna be hard for the for the governor when the U.S Senate seat but\nYou know Scott ... is pretty good governor but nonetheless you bring up a good point that the goal of if they flipped Texas or Florida then the country's done if we lose those twenty nine to thirty five electoral votes either one it's over with and and Trump can't get reelected heck a Republican can't get elected\nIf in Florida and New York uh begin to be as one enough taxes looks the same electorally as New York then we're done because Texas and Florida will tip this thing permanently [noise]\nWell I'll leave you with some good news or play I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was a pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president\nAnd I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't sure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nThat's why I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you have\nThe star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday and I've been in his presence of these rallies\nTrump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump as a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa tonight he hopefully it will be out every day between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati and Warren County it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up this guy is the messiah a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz wouldn't have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma\nDoesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and if you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies and all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty oh three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to ride that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan looked like a liberal [noise]\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruise in there but my eyes are open and here's what miles rope into that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think\nNow that I've seen it happen that my faith is behind Trump\nAs a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald did know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have confidence fake and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis kind of get back to where it needs to be\nImaginative Hillary was in the White House who would be on the Supreme Court [noise] would you have Gorsuch would you have Kevin Oh you'd have to Ginsburg look alikes and imagine the status of the country then an RPG the notorious RPG at

marriage there would be there would be a hundreds killed millions of dollars of property destroyed all hell breaks loose\nAnd average Americans looked at that and said we don't want Humphrey in sixty eight or take Nixon or promises law and order four years later the chaos continued cities continue to burn administration building taken over in college campuses murder was rampant and what happened in Nineteen Seventy two Nixon\nOne forty nine out of fifty states\nBecause the average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida couldn't look at didn't like what they were seeing on TV\nAnd you had a candidate promising law and order and are working on behalf of the moral majority and the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's doing what Nixon did in sixty eight Seventy two or\nSo and Hillary Clinton playing the part of you were a chump free says the rules of civility are suspended because Republicans control the Congress and watch the Democrats take over then the rules of civility we'll be imposed once again\nIt is a blatantly stupid comment\nTwenty eight per by a margin of twenty eight percentage points independent voters believe the Democrats actor like fools or the Kevin all committee hearings by a margin of twenty eight percent a great number see Hillary's doing this now she's Seventy Seventy one years old\nAnd she wants to appear hip and radical\nBut at say ... it's not true it doesn't work she used to say during the campaign I'm with you know Hillary as saying I'm with them the ... demonstrators that\nBlack lives matter protesters who demand the murder of cops what are we went dead cops wondering what I'm now that black lives matter protesters at say pigs in a blanket from like bacon\nFat is what is encourage men at the Democratic party and the last couple of years of the Obama administration has black radicals and white apologist all over the country scream for the murder of cops and it happened in Dallas in Baton Rouge and all over the country\nYou might recall that brought Hussein Obama into the White House took the founders and representatives del Rey ma cats than in others a black lives matter\nIs if they had a point to make the cops are racist murderers systemically which is not the case every now and then you have all the corn McDonald situation in Chicago where top should not a shot that boys sixteen times\nEvery now and then you have something bad happened the one point one one percent out of Ninety nine point nine percent when cops do water right\nBut the argument is not that the occasional cop occasionally does something wrong the argument from the Democratic party is the cops are an occupying force there not worthy of being protected and love not worthy of our support not worthy of law and order and so when a candidate like Trump promises law and order\nThe silent majority will arise and stop at the Democratic party once again to overplay its hand with Kevin ...\nAnd I don't know if the fire can be maintained another twenty eight days twenty eight days from tonight\nWe're going to have the results of most of the most of the elections by a by midnight tonight we're going to know twenty eight days from now and I'm willing to strongly predict that the United States Senate will stay within the grasp of the Republican Party because of the behavior of Democrats\nPlay overplay their hand and it's way too much so it's continuous morals go to Craig and little falls Minnesota Craig in Minnesota Welcome to the ... show bill accounting em hair incorrect please go ahead\nYeah good to hear you on the other than Sunday I'm I'm a concern that if there is a red wave which I think there's gonna be\nI'm concerned that these antifa types are going to just go absolutely bonkers everywhere\nMaybe start shooting more Republican well see that's the problem somebody comes up to my car with\nA mask on tries to drag me out of it I've got locked forty three that I'm licensed to carry in about forty four states and I think somebody at a mask is going to meet up with that and and and\nThey're actually putting me in jeopardy and they're putting a lot of other people in jeopardy I don't know how to I don't know how how we deal with that but especially these places where there's Democrats in charge and they're going to encourage it just like they're doing in Portland\nCraig I Would imagine Portland, Oregon I also have a concealed carry permit I Would imagine Oregon doesn't have reciprocity was hardly anybody and you can imagine if you're in Minnesota in Ohio and Kentucky and Alabama and Texas and Florida\nThere aren't too many mobs pulling people out to pick up trucks because that ain't gonna work maybe in Portland it works and what is so to speak up\nAll the video tonight on Fox there's a Portland police officer in uniform on a motorcycle watching these individuals shutdown intersections in downtown Portland and doing nothing about it [noise]\nCrazy that's crazy I don't know how the cops feel about it I suppose there are a beat up and they want to keep their jobs so they do with the boss tells them or or maybe they're complicit with it I don't know\nThere are investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nTo that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of um ... you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they've got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere's a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there in big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me I'll let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions or a tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just the classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with a ... team they loved to help people love to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide let the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls is what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine\nAnd just say I love to come in and meet the Harwood team and\nGet that second opinion on your portfolio Bob Let's also dive into one of the side how do people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if we were saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done that said eight out of ten of Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he listens or radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years it's just fine with you I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just helped me he said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need to use that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... you know you're not saving enough you don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my job is to make you more financially successful they are today right isn't that simple\nAnd when you call for your CPR you're pointing review with me you want to sit down with me and and meet and just talk a little bit and warned for me I'm going to show you how to get your finances on track\nAnd if you're on track I'll show you how to make them better and you're going to be better off because of the time was

Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican\nBut he has to be a Republican he used to read the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican\nYou switch daily call her the Daily Beast and that but he's a good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... a friend of mine also and never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Capitol hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies that were instigated by the left\nThe things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and hopping over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nYou remember the mobs on the campuses have UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech in a little mild mannered bench Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire Ben Shapiro's ever been around involve marshmallows in smaller ers\n... in the immortal words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob are not going to use the word ... totally a mop it is without a doubt there's no other where now it's a put a stop\nOn what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that delightful she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often deliver you're talking points ahead of time you say are you know I go on a Fox a lot I mind with Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a steward Varney and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her ... joined her she had her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I\nMean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mob which was a mob or the antifa mob which was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\nA but he did not\nDo that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left or my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national\nRadio host he uh he pointed out that uh they always report these that's mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protests this described is mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests of da da da da da\nMostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ... if they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight I mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have that poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful\nThat was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think Baldwin would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nWhat we saw chasing we've right what about\nThe people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or that a mob I think it's easily\nYeah and if there was a party or as we call it um out for sure come on let's be Syria\nYeah so that's Mary and ham jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual Republican actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was going to get pushed back she didn't have another originally under the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville sort of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that a real fast Richard\nLet me let me let me let me move past the N. word because I Do feel like that as part of the the weaponization of of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he knew that she knows says and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the ... you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's probably right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today\nAnd it's being weaponized in such a way that it is devastatingly effective against the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook\nWill start a silencing you if you take your own social media and start calling a mob mob\nBecause it's correct\nAnd it's working because no normative American wants to vote for the mob
