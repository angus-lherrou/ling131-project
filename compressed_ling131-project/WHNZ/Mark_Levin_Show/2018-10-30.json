how are you sir I'm doing great thanks so much for having me well it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate\nI just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look with Trump half the time and I let post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you\nMark into as she should be because listen I mean she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her\nTo get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nAnd Senator McCaskill turns around and vote no on Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court no one justice Kavanaugh no on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be more out of step\nWith his she running in New York and Missouri yeah\nExactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator from one of those places but for this state hardly and that is ... that's our big problem and that's why she's down in the polls or she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really has left us to be perfectly honest with you or votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or Chuck Schumer and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her of of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she is accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures are from Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country\nTrying to prop up with Senator McCaskill ended by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they\nThey don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\n[noise] the the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nWhile I Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh is a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power\nThe radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted and are not willing to accept\nThe results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything they can to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said and that is a huge issue in this race\nImmigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress\nThe most radical open borders bill ever introduced and that that is a huge huge issue and then I think a a economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against the middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes\nIn Congress and that people want somebody is going to be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\n[noise] but you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's a pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state with McCaskill saying you will oppose or ... or ... methods of protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position as she just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I've called her out on many times in our debates I support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare\nTo do it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them hall hostage to Obamacare in my state\nIncome health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges that is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan that isn't Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now is she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that's where this is headed and we all know that that does she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on ... any major issue an issue consequences and you know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixty billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare\nImagine what they'll do to pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a\n... it will devastate folks who are or who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get a hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nThat you make a good point Medicare for all his Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan that the polished all private insurance and basically turning us into one ... right\nArgument in your home from your sample ballot provide that

I mean if you can't get a senator from Montana to stand up and support property rights the second amendment securing the border than where they were going to get one\nYeah exactly let me tell you something he has supported the hard left waters of the U.S he supported the hard left\nWhen he voted against tax cuts he supported the horror of left on the on the judges the confirmation for the Supreme Court a is a pre spending every day since you've arrived in Washington DC supporting eleven\nUh increases in in that spending I mean it's it's just it's terrible it's absolutely terrible and and so the people in Montana\nI have an opportunity this election cycle to write that wrong and to send somebody in the Washington who's actually going to not just promise that's a difference between men and most people mark that are running for office\nI've done it I've served here at the state level for not too long six years and what I've showed is that when I was put in charge of the a commission of insurance insecurities reduce my operating costs by twenty three percent\nI think that's the kind of willpower and decision making that we need in Washington DC I cut fifty five rolls\nOut of the statute last year alone because it was doing nothing but generating additional paperwork and expense for the businesses that were required to do it and nobody and review the paperwork that they were generate it's out on the shelf and and um\n... uh collected dust so\nIt's you know that kind of people we need\nLiberal activists judges open borders massive government that massive government spending\n\nI mean what bothers what what shocks me not I'm I'm obviously I wasn't raised the Montana quite familiar with Montana that's big country out there you know and people people have the federal government breathing down their backs all the time and there ain't gonna get any relief from tester\nOh no they are not and I will tell you that's why I can I can get you some breaking news tonight while you're on your program that the the president President Trump is returning to Montana this Saturday in ... at twelve thirty so folks can actually go online\nTo my website ... or Montana dot com\nAnd they can a registered to get tickets to attend that event they can certainly find that contribution button and make a contribution and they can they can participate with us they could support us and they can uh joined up joined the fight joined the fight against this liberal activism that we're trying to help with the rest\n[noise] it's mat for Montana dot com couldn't be simpler America we're going to put that up on my social science mark ... show Facebook ... Twitter Matt from Montana dot com you know I'm not\nI'm speaking for myself mad not you know one of these guys who believes in contributing to the party I Believe in contributing to candidates folks when I'm putting these candidates on the program\nAnd putting their websites up on my sights I Hope to give them as much support as you possibly can you have a lot of money flowing in Montana from the west coast in the east coast don't you\nAll my Lance Josh dressed or listen to this he is the number\nOne recipient of contributions from lobbyists in the nation we've got one million people that reside in this state just over one million people\nTodd that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction significantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes\nSome money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars which is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of um ... you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you in this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there and big debt out there or that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me uh let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with a ... team they loved to help people

day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's still in his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in ah he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he listens or radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years and says finally I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire road map\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out and this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need is that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know

of the book as well but what sit together\nRobert we only have less than a minute left and I I've known him for a long time we've been personal friends before we ever put this radio show together

during the proceeding program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media and corporate income\nI went on while our government is established with various institutions that have as their purpose the preservation of our on our way to buy rights is left to law enforcement particularly our community and neighborhood police officers to ensure that our lives property and everyday activities are safeguards\nBelieve police officers are also in the front lines is the first responders when the public's threatened by acts of nature such as earthquakes are hurricanes by acts up man that endanger the public safety\nIn certain instances are police officers serve is neutral protectors of our rights as citizens such as car to guarantee the safety of peaceful protesters marched on a public street training slogans we might find offensive\nFor these reasons police officers are often referred to as peace offices\nMy father's now Ninety three years old he's authored in illustrated several wonderful children's books in each book he seeks to open the eyes and minds of young people to the greatness of American history principles and values he wants the next generation to be proud of America's his generation\nIn his brand new book are police my father has written an illustrated another beautiful book for my family to yours we hope you enjoy it\n[noise] so [noise]\nThis obviously this final book and I\nI think particularly the loving audience out there more than any other audience you have children and grandchildren I think they'll enjoyed very much you sit down and show them the pictures and read it to them at a at bedtime and so forth [noise]\nIt's a good way to counter what goes on a TV unfortunately and a lot of our public schools it's not a propaganda piece it's\nJust old fashioned\nPositive views about our country which is the way my dad was and that's what he taught us [noise]\nSo you can get in an Amazon dot com I think it's thirty percent off I think it's Thirteen or fourteen bucks you can get an Amazon dot com I'm not pushing this for money we don't need the money I'm pushing it because I Know he would want me to get the word out there and that's exactly what I'm doing\n[noise] um\nLet's talk about birthright citizenship then we'll get an all the rest of it\n[noise] Paul Ryan said something today that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright citizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up I heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide\nThe ... first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay nobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old I started doing triggered it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed\nThat conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens there's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children nobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it\nSo the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is and so when the president is asked about it and says how did you find out about this yeah we're working on an executive no you can't\nChange the constitution by executive order well does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't\nWhich all explaining a minute\nBut here's the current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months\nBut now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in in in the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where\nYou have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges in New Jersey who say the same exact thing ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did and twenty Fifteen\nOver three years ago we can go back further but that's long enough to provide a basic foundational understanding\nOf what those who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually meant\nThat's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years\nAnd he's a professor at California State University who was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there for more than I ever did to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee a Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago and he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west task or Leno growl yeah has professor at the University of Texas law school maybe more than than the framers of the constitution\n\nOr set forth that is a primary the fourteenth amendment got\nHave after the civil war three amendments to the constitution the Thirteen fourteen Fifteen called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred professor earlier was testifying he said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth Amendment\nTo define the jurisdiction of the United states of the fourteenth amendment of course and did it as my contention that Congress has exercise that power on many occasions and most recently of immigration reform of control lack of Nineteen eighty six and I would say they also exercise it\nWith the illegal immigration reform an immigrant responsibility act Nineteen Ninety six\nHe points out senator Jacob how're you are now going to know more than anybody else ladies and gentlemen you know one of the things I find when I signed books and it's good to do it because I get to talk to so many of you people say mark your show is different because you really get into the substance now we have fun don't get me wrong we do our thing too\nBut we do really get into the substance it's one thing to say yeah yeah yeah obviously the constitution doesn't provide\nThat's not enough\nThat's not enough so when you're in a debate format or political format or a classroom\nFormat or this format\nYou need to back it up and that's what we do here we back it up by\nSenator Jacob Howard the author of the citizenship clause in the fourteenth amendment he spoke he told us what he meant\nHe defined who would fall within the quote jurisdiction of the United states unquote ready quote every\nYou know nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight or\n[noise]\nOr shot as loves cells in dollars Texan nationwide gee we're still the two hundred two hundred you'll get a text confirming in three plus by heart radio info standards data message rates apply in this nation wide contest that spills tissue under two hundred\nAfter Martin living in the ... the double your age and [noise]\n\nOur love and making conservatism grazing again dial in no age seven seven three one two three a one one [noise]\nSo in the Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies somehow somewhere the bureaucracy began\nNot even interpreting the constitution just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\nIs my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of National Review is he's wanted to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified I was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion address the issue\nCaught a following the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of the statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens and then we have Paul Ryan\nLet's play cut six again Mr boosts and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch checking back in ... to interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't [noise] while you're when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\n... who's changing immigration laws you know I brought as a guest here Daniel Horwitz who's an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent he writes over a conservative review a and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\n[noise] oh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the loss of your patriot dead he's a he's in a better place thank you\nUm you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd he has the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you could do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agreed to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't want a ... a very activist decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that to people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring this and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seemed to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes ... list and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly what they meant\nAnd nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right on even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one came all arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the court in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is that a lot so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom that such an egregious argument that\nThe one in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nAnd instead that is being bastard dies to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise\nAll American citizens black and white and everything else at the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a\nRed limit let me just say that I have to go some Len let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans\nThat amendment that amendment was for former slaves that's it\nDone and it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil or the post civil war amendments was to protect\nFormer slaves had nothing to do with illegal aliens same sex marriage this one not one of the nothing whatsoever so the left pours its agenda end of the fourteenth amendment which wants to do Daniel Horwitz keep up the good work we much appreciate and my friend thanks so much God Bless and God Bless you to\nListen to this the iris hired a small army of private collectors
