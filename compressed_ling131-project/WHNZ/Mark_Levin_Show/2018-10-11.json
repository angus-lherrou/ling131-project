H. N. Z.\nWhen still helpful\nYou can listen to our ... our radio I downloaded that\nHe's the news on the hour sponsored by their works relief\nThat require confirmation by the United States Senate that are still sitting and still languishing without any action from the Senate\nMuch of it is because of the arcane rules of the Senate which as we know Mitch McConnell can change right now today\nAnd he has not and this is the resistance these are the Democrats Chuck Schumer he said he said going into this administration that he was going to make every single appointment a fight to the death\nAnd and they would demand debate they would the manned the time needed for I think it's something like ... every single nominee that requires Senate confirmation or if they want to if they want to hold up the works they can put all of these roadblocks in\nThat end up being like Seventy hours of debate for each one and of course the ... in the past they haven't done that they've been deferential and they said listen every president deserves the right and opportunity and leeway to put people in place that he has put in place and and selected to be put in place\nThat's called the deferential act it's called respect for our American government it's called a a fundamental understanding that the executive branch of the United states federal government must be failed\nSo that it can function but the Democrats haven't allowed that to happen\nUh let me read this or much of this editorial for you you understand what we're talking about anyone seeking a mid career sabbatical should seek a presidential nomination to a position that requires Senate confirmation Jewish majority leader Mitch McConnell is teeing up more votes this week and the GOP needs to move fast\nBecause the glacial pace of staffing the government will slow to near zero if Democrats retake the Senate it's it's pretty close to zero now guys\nMr McConnell has felt cloture on three nominees including two assistant attorneys general who have been in a rubber room for more than a year to assistance attorneys general have been waiting for their floor of vote for nearly a year I think about that\nYou want to know why the Justice Department has trouble functioning and doing things why they're spread a little ...\n\nWe can't we can't run a government this way\nAnd the Democrats I suppose that's supposed to be all about running the government they love the government why are they holding up this president and his nominations ... Phil basic function every roles in the United states government and the executive branch politics because they still think Hillary should have one\nAnd they're trying to make life a living and health for this president they want dysfunction in the federal government so they can run in twenty twenty and saying well he couldn't even run the government right\nThat's what they're trying to do\nPresident Trump nominated Jeffrey ... Clarke says the wall Street Journal editorial to run the environment and natural resources division in June twenty Seventeen\nDitto Erica dry banned for civil rights the third is an assistant Pentagon secretary who would oversee manpower and reserve affairs Democrats vow cloture on every nominee which kicks off thirty hours of debate\nEven if no senator as opposed to understand this\n\nBut Democrats care about the environment so Trump dominates Jeffrey bus or clerk to run the environment and natural resources division of the Justice Department in June of last year of last year\nAnd they haven't allowed to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump has put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador to Germany right now who people are saying should be the best with you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no one bastard or Germany and once he got there\nBoy he is is whipped that continent into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nIn Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry is suddenly doing business with the terrorists mullahs of Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get Rick right now as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that's what Trump one way that it's because they didn't have as an Basset are there\nThat's just one example\nSo Democrats filed closure this is a Senate rule that can be changed in should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing it to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate let's think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want a slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nGoing back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years ... wells\nYou don't hear about this in the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirmed more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do instead he is now saying hey it's a nice\nAs rich as we

C. you're on the market within show on Larry O'Connor\nHey Larry how you doing I'm good how are things in law and we have to take back the government and the way to do that as protest I go on the lights are the marched out of Washington in January it's a piece called march how many CNN\nAnd then he sees all those stations cover that much knowledge it's a piece called march\nYou got almost a million people showed up there this past year yup Cabot I've been doing it for a long time okay we should march on Washington peacefully surprise the senators and representatives not tell them when it's going to happen [laughter] I hate that down there and get in\nThe ... before you do and I will let you get your the thing but it's you know you're so right in pointing out the march for life you know I I live in Washington I'm able to see the march for life and you're right it happens\nUsually or the third or fourth week of January it's usually bitter cold out there\nIt is usually close to a million people you know you saw the a video of the of the screaming Mimi is in the streets or the Saturday after the confirmation vote for justice Kevin ... you saw the video coverage of that nonstop on the news or do you know how many people were actually there\n... probably two hundred\n... a little more than that I'd say it was between a thousand and Fifteen hundred but they had the most generous camera angles on them to make it look like the streets were just you just overflowing with outrage and and and it wasn't\nUm the but you're right you're so right how the march of light doesn't march for life doesn't get the coverage here's my question though we don't march I mean we're we're conservatives were good for maybe one march a year and it's the march for life may be a second march\nUh here in there but usually eating that's not our style right we don't have the big Soros groups who were handing out walking around money in passing out the pre printed ... sides\nTo march do you think we have it in us do you think that will set our jobs aside in our in our in our families aside so that we can all come to this country say can town Washington DC in March\nOr do you think that we let our voices be heard by actually being good Americans and living our lives\nIf we do not do that we do not get down there and present are cases these people that are voting on stuff

Pennsylvania are you happy with this\n\nChristopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the AG offices must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions Horner said\nDavid Hey is the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we got it\nWe got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBlumberg throws millions of dollars at this NYU program NYU then hires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his\nBudget doesn't come out of the state budget they answer to the attorney general be you know who's bidding they're doing they're not doing the bidding of you the voter you the people in those states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that specifically then sous Exxon Mobil Chesapeake why what whatever oil company in this country\nOr sues the PTA and the Trump Administration trying to shut down progress trying to shut down our economy trying to shut down fracking oil drilling\nSo that they can do the bidding of the well funded environmental wackos\nAnd this is going on in your state\nAnd it's disrupting the progress of our federal government and the EPA that President Trump is in charge of\nAnd why because they can't win at the ballot box they can't win in the elections and so they just throw a bunch of money at lawyers and they tried to sue everybody to try to get their way and try to push their agenda\n\nI'm Larry O'Connor this is the mark living show [noise]\nThe next

um do man was not come from the Bronx you get into my space and into my face and I feel free you're going down and you know what the what do you do what a bully get punched him in the mouth\nAnd these people were like sitting ducks just like we're like little flowers around the country and we let these things happen it's got to stop\nAll right Paul is bringing some Bronx justice to the streets right now and listen this is when I see these mobs when I see the the crap going on there that's exactly what I think to that's what my instinct is as well this is what is it I don't want them to be violence\nOr most of the time my rule of thumb was studies is if it doesn't make common sense I tend to not believe it\n[laughter] if it cuts against the grain of what I mean if I see a study and I said well that can't be true that makes no sense my entire life history and every single person I Know in my life and everyone that I've ever talked to a informed me that that is a a load of of of steaming dog do\nAre generally speaking then I I go with my instincts and I and I disregard the study this one though\nI find to be fascinating and I think that it makes sense\nBut what I'd like you to tell me is why\nWhy do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nOver male politicians midterm elections are just around the corner\nAnd so it could be a potential turn the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says the skewed article from study finds a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males a survey of fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers at the Steven's Institute of technology and I won't get bogged down in a lot of the uh various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find this to be a sort of the most important part\nOf when it breaks it down between a Republicans and Democrats\nOr this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician male Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way\nRepublican men and women\nAre fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me\nIf I'm looking at two Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same and and in terms of their their a resume their track record it's is it I'd have to flip a coin between two Republican candidates and one man and one's a woman\nI'd probably go for the check I'd I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why I\nGot I think it makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most ... nations fighters for the conservative cause\nHave been women I'm just more impressed by them and I think they're used to take him to death a little bit more and they give it back a little bit better\nI think men are are are are too easily touted by the media they they don't want to be called names they don't want to be a a old don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm not going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\n[noise] but women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they hurt at all and they don't give a damn really the life I had\nFight my way and the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising grad and you think I'm going to be concerned about about a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please\nI've given birth I don't I don't need to worry about you I've been through it all but I I tend to want to put the baby in\nThere and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans that conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference\nWhich truly shows that it's that conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia that don't judge people by the chromosome or make up we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how woke I Am\nI'm I'm I'm more feminist than Alan Alda just wait I'll I'll you betcha I think that this is the way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three of what three at one one but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes uh they they want to show

afternoon host on WMA ill in\nWashington DC rhyme on right before ... back then dug yeah slice been good to me so far as well [noise]\nUh a couple of quick things I Want to get to eight seven seven three one three eight one one I Want you to please go to Amazon dot com right now and check out the brand new book our police by Jacqueline that's marks dad you know he's already written a couple of books that are just a phenomenal\nI Love hearing mark talk about his dad's books too I vividly remember him talking for a good a long time about the uh\nWashington crossing the Delaware book I remember vividly uh it's coming out October thirtieth and\nIt's so important to make sure that our children and our grandchildren are nephews and our nieces and everyone our allies know the real good news about the police in our society and our culture and how ... they are to a well ordered society how important they are to our lives in this book covers all the different kinds of police\nThe you might run into in see it's a beautiful book beautiful illustrations it's called our police by jak within ... dead\nYou can order it now I got that I Want to tell you that speaking of our police\nAre pleased at an incredible job today up in New York federal authorities they haven't named which jurisdictions yet I'll Try to get more details on this but I Believe that this was a multi jurisdiction effort ah I Know a couple of people who work in a\nA various parts of our domestic defense here in this country I Can't get too specific ah gave me a bit of a heads up on this uh from the AP federal authorities have charged in New York man with building a\nTwo hundred pound bomb a Ninety kilos bomb and his plans were to detonate it on election day at the national mall in Washington\nDid\nYou think they're playing around here you you think that when that Elizabeth Warren goes out there with a megaphone stirring up the protesters when you when Hillary Clinton says sitting there in Oxford\nWith Chris John on them pour on CNN when she says that we can't return to civility until the Democrats win back the house in the Senate you think would Maxine Waters screens no justice no peace\nAnd then tells people to get in the face of Republicans\nAnd not them let them have a day of peace as long as they're standing in the way of them retaining power you think they're messing around here\nYou think this is just a coincidence\nA man in New York was building a two hundred pound bomb that he planned to detonate at the national mall in Washington on election day and then we've got Eric Holder the former attorney general under Brock Obama just yesterday in Georgia let's hear that one again\nShallow he says I Love you know [noise] my wife like really tight um which was the ...\n... says you know when they go low we [laughter]\nThey go low we can [noise]\n\nWas his new democratic or any of\nThat is there I\nDon't say you weren't warned don't say oh gosh they they we had no idea they're telling you they're literally telling you when they go low we kick them says former attorney general Eric Holder but see this is what I remember when\nThe former Mayor Rudy Giuliani of New York was running when he wasn't running for president this time he was at the convention the Republican convention a for John McCain\nFor the late John McCain and I remember when he gave his speech and he was mocking Brock Obama you know in any it I remember he listed off all of the accomplishments of John McCain and all the things that John McCain it accomplished in his military life in a civilian life and his political life in his public life and then he said\nAnd who to the Democrats have they have a community organizer remember this number and and and Rudy lefty chuckled anyone\nFor what is that what is that\nNow you know what that is now you know this is community organize this is what\nComes from eight years of a community organizer\nIn the oval office inspiring his people his followers to get in your face\n\nYou want to know what community organizing his community organizing is when they go low we kick them\nCommunity organizing is there\nWe'll be no civility unless we were in the house in the Senate\nCommunity organizing is standing in front of somebody's house with a bullhorn screaming at them because you're upset with the job they have\nBecause they because they worked for a bank or they work for an oil company where there are a lobbyist\nPromoting something other than killing unborn babies the lobbyists who worked for Planned Parenthood oh they're they're wonderful people doing the Lord's work but a lobbyist who wants to make fracking legal so that our economy can dominate the rest of the world and we can be energy independent oh no no no they need to be disrupted that's community organizing\nOr the numbers the same folks uh eight hundred again the first time caller is get the book eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine Bob we have a lot to cram in in the final segment here let's\nBefore we get into the Roth IRA and if you're not saving enough for a time and how do you know give us just a quick overview on the new try a Trump tax plan which was approved was signed what do our listeners need to know about\nTheir investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nDie that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars which is what I estimate and that's a really good thing\nYou still want to put in your for one case you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax\nAt uh jeeze employers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a pool you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an account to a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employees a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting their strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out their big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me I'll let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions or a tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with the Harwood team they loved to help people they loved to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide and let the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls is what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine and just say\nI'd love to come in and meet the Harwood team and get that second opinion on your portfolio\nBob Let's also dive into\nOne of the ... how do people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done that said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what is your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in a he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he listens or radio he was one of these gentlemen that that had never called in you know listen to us for years and says finally I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire road map\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out and this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough or what I Need is that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving enough you don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my job is to make you more financially successful they are today right isn't that simple\nAnd when you call for your CPR you're pointing review with me you want to sit down with me and and meet and just talk a little bit and warned for me I'm going to show you how to get your finances on track\nAnd if you're on track I'll show you how to make them better and you're going to be better off because of the time was spent together so if you have a cold and if you're one of those listeners haven't called in yet or or you just feel like you want to do better with your finances you're not doing good enough\nGive me a call it's eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine and say hey I listen to Robert I listen to you for a long time and I just want to come in for review or ask for a copy of the book when you call will send you a copy of the book as well but what sit together\nRobert we only have less than a minute left and less I've known him for a long time we've been personal friends before we ever put this radio show together you've built an amazing financial practice and I just can't implore\nPeople enough to call your office making the appointment\nIt doesn't cost a penny there's no obligation no one's gonna bug you but for people to come in and just bring in their current investment strategy their current portfolio and just like you look it over and give them a second opinion\nFolks you you're leaving valuable information and a potentially a whole lot of money on the table by not taking Robert Harward up on the offer folks\nIt has a simple phone call eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine say I love the appointment firsthand colors get the free book investing for retirement best selling on Amazon that Robert ... wrote\nFirst ten callers eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine get the book\nAnd also make the appointment eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine and we'll see you next time [noise]\nTo find out more about financial advisor Robert Harward and the heart would weigh call Harwood financial at one eight hundred three nice five\nFour to seven one eight hundred three nine five four to seven died for online the Harwood way dot dom\n\n\nThe proceeding was a

H. N. Z. A. M. it staff management or parent company I heart media incorporate gene\nWith helpful\nTo keep them in their lane of slavery\nWest as a black guy Kanye West\nBack in the day said George Bush hates black people remember that Mr producer can you grab that audio do you mind doing that\nKanye West was a guy that after Hurricane Katrina\nCame out on national TV at a fundraiser and said George Bush hates black people no one said that he was not reading then there wasn't a black Democrat in America when he said that that would have said this afterwards tell you is what happens when negroes don't read [noise]\nThink about that Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read I Would argue that as an incredibly racist statement I Would argue that's a perfect example of modern day slavery from the car sellers\nNow in ... west said this after Hurricane Katrina listen to it\nThe most tragic loss of all George Bush doesn't care about black people [noise]\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people did you hear the car sellers say this is what happens when they grow don't read snow you didn't hear you want to know why because that was okay to be said on the liberal plantation of owning African Americans like modern day slaves\n\nYou look at what modern day slavery is in this country what is it\nIt is a party that controls the thoughts and the minds of African Americans it is a party that demands that African Americans don't succeed but fail so they're dependent on their government aid and they keep them in those poverty at high poverty high crime failing schools\nAnd when you bring up that you want these kids to be out of failing schools what do they say\nThey say no because we've got employees that are black working in the schools and where unions as teachers and you can't destroy public ... education I Would agree with that you can you've already done it so impossible for me as a white Republican destroyed public education you guys have already taken care of that on the left\nI Would argue that the left doesn't mind that young African American kids are in failing schools\nBecause that keeps them on their plantation\nThat keeps them in modern day slavery and so what happened was as you have a I I I'm referring to the car sellers and what he said you're a negro\nWho went from living on the plantation miss producer wants to play that audio again this is Kanye West while living on the plantation talking about George Bush after Hurricane Katrina\nGeorge Bush doesn't care about black people\nHe said and I quote George Bush hates black people and everybody clapped\nEverybody said Kanye West is a great black man who's calling out an evil white president and it was okay to say that on that on that day because that was words that were okay to say on the Democratic plantation vendor Kanye West\nComes out in ... and start singing for himself and starts realizing hey this this world I live in slavery is not very good\nI I'm saying massive crime rates in my hometown of Chicago which apparently is moving back to I'm seeing poverty I'm saying are kids that are getting a good education I'm seeing all of these things and he starts questioning the plantation owners which is the Democratic party\nHe starts questioning the rich black guys\n\nWho are running the Democratic party who are telling them that no no no you need to stay in poverty because well take care of you there don't you don't need to think for yourself no no you can't even have an id to vote we're going to make sure you can vote without id because we don't even expect you to have an id\nHow races has that mentality\nAnd then ... says you know what\nI'm going to be independent I ought to be independent thinker I'm going to come out and say that I like black unemployment rate in all the time what I like a president that wants to talk about creating jobs the African American community and set of offering up welfare checks and food stamps\nAnd he does it and then\nThey reprimand this man who got off the Democratic plantation tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nHow is that not the most racist statement\n\nIs it not racist because the Democrat says it not racist because the black person said is it not racist because\nIt's supported by all Democrats\nThe same Democratic Party that says Donald Trump's treats or ... horrible\nThis same Democrats say that Donald Trump bullies people and it's terrible that same Democrats today they're sending out tweets about this being national coming out day for the gay and lesbian transgender bisexual community and we should love every one if you get off their plantation they'll say this to you\nTell you what is what happens when negroes don't read\nThere it is don't tell me that the Democratic party cares about black people\n\nDon't tell me that this isn't racism don't tell me that this is not slavery modern day slavery you shut up you sit\nDown in the back of our black bus and our black party and our Democratic Party and you say what we tell you to say and what you're going to say is George Bush hates black people and you're brilliant but if you ever get out of that lane\nIf you ever get off our plantation and try to make a name for yourself or have independent thoughts we will go out on national TV and we will bully you and we will tell people that you're mentally unfit you're mentally insane you are mentally incompetent you've been to a hospital before for mental health issues\nClearly the white man's taking advantage of you all and by the\nWay you're an ignorant black person\nTo tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nThere it is that is your Democratic Party\nThat's exactly what they say if you leave their democratic plantation now\nI'll be happy to hear you tell me how I'm wrong now I Would love for you to tell me why it's appropriate because a black man disagrees with the Democratic black party and walks off their democratic plantation and actually starts to say things that makes sense about the reality of the economy\nHow this isn't shaming bullying racism how this is I mean\nThe same party that says I again it's coming out day come out love everybody saying well love everybody let's support all the gay lesbian transgender demise sexual but\nAh we also got a rip on a black man today who went and became a Republican tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read and then we'll say they ignorant because he can't even read\n\nOne eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven won eight
