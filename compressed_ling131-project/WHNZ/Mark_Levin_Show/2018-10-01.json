standard deduction\nSignificant way on your tax return and it should save every body that is an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars which is what I estimate and that's a really good thing\nYou still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a pool of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller size and we help them with their finances

clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there in big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay a down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me I'll let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions or a tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things
