{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "There are investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nGod that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right so if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing\nYou still want to put in your ... you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee and we have a lot of employees we help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a pool you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employees a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting their strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this planet unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with that big deficit out there and big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me I'll let me teach you what I Know go ask your advise your questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why

they do stories on this why don't they do stories long stories repetitive stories rather than on porn stars and their lawyers and all the rest of it why don't they go to the college campuses and see what happens to the Jews on our\nCollege campuses why don't they see what happens\nWith the Palestinian organizations\nYou really want to get to the bottom of it they don't want to get to the bottom

the thing to do under two hundred his radio show\nMe he's been in [noise]\n\nBars on memory 'cause passionately so we were all boys talk with that voice now eight seven seven three one two three eight one one what's an honor to have the ambassador\nTo the United states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on or what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with them what did you see there's a\nWhile it's a horrific act or worse anti Semitic attacking and us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nThat to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive I'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people I have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community\nAnd I think a special community and squirrel hill a Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight knit it's not just taking it among the Jewish community but also the non Jewish community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians are Jewish faith leaders of Muslim leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well\nAnd uh I think the whole community is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there in in the ... everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here and I think they were just shocked and stunned are and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with them that they're not alone\nAnd in Israel yesterday morning our government meets on Sunday 'cause Sundays like Monday and Israel the first day of the week\nAnd the government meets every Sunday and there was a moment of silence where the entire government of Israel stood because we are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel or a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why it was important for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami or brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach that was about that yeah we are the ones with the speech that that's true um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you were in Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout your him\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nOr we can ... it is as you say a growing problem uh many people want to say that it began in two thousand sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you should look at the FBI statistics that you mention a\nIn two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population mark and their accounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of an\nAttack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is that it once again become fashionable or to attack cues and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves\nBehind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state but at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you've seen attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six energy federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen and the Jewish community center a at outside of Kansas Kansas City which I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um\nYou can have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there is a stream missing it could be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities have hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media\nIs you have this rise of abuse online hate groups I think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given them a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're you're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment second to Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws in constitutional rights that Americans have\nTo figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of this kind of hate pops up and then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel\nHaters can always find a reason to hate things and it's been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific act is capable stand together against at the ... President Trump is not the reason why you have a Jeremy Corbyn\nIn Europe or the head of the British Labour Party who's an anti Semite if it's not the reason why you have all these attacks and a half for many years and Europe against choose unfortunately this thing is\nHave come here to the United states and ... and is now ... eleven uh worshipers in ... uh Pittsburgh but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite on all sides\nAnd people should stand together against his and call out the anti Semite on their side of the political ...\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your own side whether it's David Duke whether it was fair con wherever it calms whether it's not a college campus with people trying to single out Israel and the same and demonize Israel and make all these wild charges that Israel's in apartheid state of racist state\nA perpetrator of genocide\nWhich I think triggers a lot of people to a level of hatred towards Israel the kids don't see of any other country this demonization wherever it is people have to stand up to it and I think in protecting the booze I think they're going to be protecting everybody\nAll right and bass in Iran drummer of Israel we appreciate your time God Bless and thank you sir thank you\n[noise] he's really good okay I've laid out he's laid it out any objective news organization should be laying the south but they're not going to cause they're not objective and they're really not news organizations anymore not many of them\nYou know falls officially here temperatures across the country are dropping certainly are where I live\nAfter a long summer of running your air conditioning the time is quickly approaching the start running your heater is temperatures drop in most of the country\nThe national weather center saying the north and central part of the U.S look experience a cold or October than years passed now is the perfect time to consider servicing your system and replacing your age ...\nWith a perfect company to help you make your life that much easier filtered by dot com America's leading provider of HPV vaccine filters for homes and small businesses\nChoose for over six hundred sizes including custom options that ship free within twenty four hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in America say five percent when you subscribe pro auto replacement so you'll never forget to change your filters ever again filtered by will save\nYou time money and help you breathe better that's filtered DUI dot com filtered by dot com and tell them mark sent you\nLook we need to spend a lot of time on this election that's coming up too and we have approximately ten candidates that are coming on this program in the course of this week\nI Will also be doing an appearance on Hannity uh at some point this week and we're going to ah commit my Sunday show to a ... or the pre election as well it's just way too important\nWe've got some very very close races\nIn what's at stake here is enormous\nAs I say it's Americanism versus socialism it really is for those of us really know what's Americanism versus progressive isn't to talk to you to know the media in this country we don't like to be called the enemy the people there are certainly not the front of the people gone long ago\nA is the day when CNN and MSNBC and these\nThese used to be reputable organization really focused on reporting the news rather than driving the news and creating the news these news conferences now the White House you clean nothing that's newsworthy nothing I'll be right back [noise] month\nI'm Gordon Diehl joined me tomorrow morning five to nine on twelve fifty W H that's the word education\nWill it means to lead forth the word fourth raises another question which way is for it", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "29"}
