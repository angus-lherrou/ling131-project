Houston or the Houston area it lovely lovely person a liberal\nBut a very sensible liberal I Know that sounds like a contradiction in terms but you know not like the ... jobs like Adam Schiff or a Maxine Waters or that sort no\nShe was a very very thoughtful person\nAnd I want you to listen to what she said she was the chairperson of the commission that was looking in immigration in Nineteen Ninety five and then you should a a really terrific report and here in part is what she had to say about it go ahead\nWe recognize that there are costs as well as benefits to illegal immigration and some of the costs are associated with the impact of immigrants on like ... to which they migrate in this promotion of late large number\nLet's stop right there she's even talking about legal immigration not even illegal immigration and she's raising some significant issues respecting legal immigrant okay go ahead\n[noise] you know that you can look at a map of the country and I did it by where there's a constant friction hugging immigrants\n[noise] when immigrants are less well educated and less skills as they may pose economic hardships for the most vulnerable of America particularly those who are unemployed or underemployed [noise]\nImmigrants sometimes utilize public service services disproportionately as in the case of elderly immigrants [noise]\nWhat the commission is concerned about all the unskilled workers in our society in an age in which unskilled workers have far too few opportunities open to them [noise]\nAnd which welfare reform will require thousands defined more jobs and the commission sees no justification do the continued in three of unskilled foreign workers\nUnless the rationale for their admission otherwise serves a significant national interest as does the admission of nuclear family members and refugees\nAnd among top there and what she says earlier in our time to play the whole thing is we should prioritize the entrance legally ... nuclear families\nAnd real refugees are\nNot poor people from the third world not illiterate people from the third world not twenty year old men from the third world\nThat's what she said\nThat's what she said she'd be a pariah\nToday in the Democratic party because the Democratic party has lost all sense of responsibility all of It's MORNING go ahead\n[noise] under the commission's recommendations that professionals with at least a baccalaureate degree and skilled experienced workers would qualify\nWe have come to firm conclusions however on one aspect of the a temporary worker policy\nThe commission believes that a large scale agricultural guest worker program sometimes referred to as a revisiting of the ... agreement is not in our national interest\nWe not unanimously ... wrongly believe that such a program would be a reverse mistake\nNot listen to that John McCain used to run around and talk about the\n... immigrants in this country to pick lettuce is what I think he said who else is going to pick lettuce and here you can see Barbara Jordan saying I'll be half of the commission in Nineteen Ninety five the worst thing we can do is bring in temporary workers who work in agriculture so worst thing we can do\nAnd yet this is what the chamber of commerce in the United states pushes for this is what our friend Lindsey Graham pushes for this is not what the Democratic Party uniformly pushes for the poor the better the more illiterate the better the more people can get into the welfare system the better\nBecause their voters eventually\n\nWhat did I just say at the top of the segment the left does what's expedient for itself\nWe conservatives are trying to defend that promote our founding principles\nGo ahead\nI urge private industry churches community groups volunteer groups individuals to read doubled their efforts to provide English language instruction and civics education to immigrants\nNow see she's pushing for a simulation English and civics\nWhat is the last time you heard Chuck Schumer say that one of the last time you heard Bernie Sanders say that what is the last time you've heard any of these so called journalists who are

with you how to plan\nHow to put more safety or poor full water the things you need to do and Kevin brought up a good point and that is that most people you either don't have an adviser\nYou don't have a plan or your advisor as more of a broker than a fiduciary and Kevin was talked about that for do share thing because I Want everyone to understand is a little better why is it so important to work with a fiduciary all it's very\nImportant that afflict do Sherry has a legal obligation to do what you and your best interests\nWhat's different is we work for you we don't work for the name on
