F. word a lot was going to somehow changes tune with the president here's what he had to say today\nThat's not worried about the future all we really have is today we just have the day over and over and over again the eternal return the hero's journey and Trump is on his hero's journey\nRight now and he might not have expected to have a crazy movie Kanye West's run up and are so poor\n\nDon't ...

going to slander do because he doesn't agree with us want to eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven was getting to your phone calls on this one Madeline you are on the marquee event show than Ferguson filling in an eye hello\nAnd thank you so much and like you're doing an excellent job thrown into mark thank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I have two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I had a suicide attempt a number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was going in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out\nAbout somebody abuses that were going on\nAnd some of the you know quake nut rolls and what have you all of the sudden I seem to have like sports disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought ahead anything but you know mental illness from depression\nAnd uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of two places even up to the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on that and you're homeless twice I've lived in my car but it's also suicide prevention month\nAnd I think by making it sound as though Congress has some kind of mental illness whether he guys left I think it's not even an issue because as you said they had nothing to say that about him before them spoke out about Bush\n[noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWas and it was an email today was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nHis technically we're just it just that people know that we were\nWhen we make it clear what it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I\nSay this first of all thank you for your sharing your story and I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your wife or I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have\nGreat compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues as a token a\nBlack man uh and and there and he's taking advantage of using him by putting them out there today no one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they wanted they they they were OK with that narrative then you are on the Marco venture open for some reason I go ahead\nStole my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was part of the hit that um they check this out so now Herschel walkers going to be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it was horrible at these lessons are doing but that's a whole nother thing let's talk about or colder Eric Holder\nNot only him I Will first she's the only attorney general to be a contempt of Congress but that's a whole nother issue with the Obama's going to really you when you know you really gone too far in show probably grabbed her by the IRS and said you can't do this for quite yet we're not there yet\nUm but him Hillary Clinton Maxine Waters are Democrats our base that's all they do is they're inciting violence and then they say it in the in the means of\n... and then and then they act like they get they get all you know their paintings in a wide when they when you say they're acting like a mob mentality\nWhen you have people screaming and beating on the doors of the Supreme Court because they didn't get their way that's that's a mob mentality\nWhen you surround a senator or like Ted Cruz at dinner a that's a mob mentality when you go in and you and you do these eat in and sit ins and screaming in the hallways and you get famous people to show up and then they're asking do you want to get arrested and you say yes that's a mob mentality\nDeal with it I mean if you want to talk about being honest be honest with it yes we are acting like a bunch of children were acting like a mob yes we're out here today to seek out and destroy people when we think about the sadistic\nMob mentality you have to have to ... to ... to first of all\nYou have a woman that doesn't and Mrs Ford they didn't want her name to come out and you do it anyway so you say we don't care about you were going to use the canary\nWe're going to force you to defend your story about sexual assault so hopefully we can find others it will say the same thing about Brett Kavanaugh and then what we're going to do is we're going to find people to say well you had sex so we have a boat in the eighties well wait we've got to recant the store and there might never happen\nWell he he he actually in high school was was every weekend making parties for gang rapes and gang banging and and throwing trains on women no one else was ... but we got a porn star lawyer an Avon Audi that will that will act like it's a legitimate and we'll throw it on the news to try to find other women out there\nThat this is what I mean this is the left this is what they're doing right now this is the normal for them and the reason why they're doing this is all I or go back to\nWhat I said earlier than there is not a single issue that Democrats can actually run on right now except for personal hate\nAnd and to turn people into villains so that you hate them\nThat's the only way you can't scare people on the economy you can't scare people on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan you can't scare people on on healthcare because you you are the ones that we create the health care disaster\nYou can't scare people on Social Security Medicare Medicaid so the only thing left for you to do right now is to say this guy's a racist and you don't want to raise has to be in the White House\nKanye West is mentally ill so you shouldn't listen to him if you're a black person\nYeah I mean it's terrible that they really have no platform well don't forget they also have to take away the tax because we have to take away your problems away um we also got to have open borders and\nI'm abolish ice high crime I mean that's what they have to stand on speaking about the mob mentality I challenge any of these people to walk down\nI'm downtown Portland or a I've got friends down in Austin, Texas you go to parks down there and

they cannot handle it\n\nMSNBC called it an assault on our White House listen to how MSNBC went off on Kanye West for what they refer to as a bonkers rant this is how they describe as a bonkers rant\nBonkers I bonkers rant and said it was an embarrassment\nTo the White House this is there this is their actual news coverage wow okay I'm doing this for everybody who is watching us or turn the volume down put back up again\nThat while I was at a thoughtful play by play and political and I'll sit here not sticking his that was going to fall on our White House we're not we're not uh how is\nKanye West the black guy hugging a white guy talking about\nThings that matter in America how is that an assault on our White House to MSNBC just just out of\nCuriosity a thoughtful play by play and political and now says you're not thinking that wasn't his fault on our White House it\nWas an assault on our White House definitely not a mob mentality that by the left no that was you're not going to get salt fooling ourselves\nFrom a a thoughtful play by play and political and now says you're not because that was an assault on our White House when\nI was an assault on our White House I tell you oh it gets better with more MSNBC not just Kanye West that just an assault on our White House note when when Bill Clinton was doing on sex from an intern in the oval office ... that was not an assault on our White House oh\nWe're not a ... where he began to analyze some of that stuff that was said I'm as we want you to talk a little bit of profanity with there was actually more than you heard we we were able to bleach some of it out [noise] uh but there was a public did make it in there [noise] um that was crazy wanders I mean the things that are telling you said\nBefore we get into the Roth IRA and if you're not saving enough for a time and how do you know\nGive us just a quick overview on the new crowd Trump's tax plan which was approved was signed what do you our listeners need to know about there are investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nTo a that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right\nSo if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that as an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand dollars\nWhich is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you\nStill want to put in your for one case you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee and we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of a poor you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable or more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney if you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you and this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this planet unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there and big debt out there uh that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me or let me teach you what I Know go ask your advise your questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help us unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with the horror with team they loved to help people they loved to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide and let the Harwood team guide you instead of walking around bumping into walls is what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine and just say\nI'd love to come in and meet the Harwood team and get that second opinion on your portfolio\nBob Let's also dive into\nOne of the side how did people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nNow that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's still in his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done said eight out of ten Americans do not know how much money they're going to need and retirement in other words what\nIs your number what do you need and retirement\nAnd it's really important to know that number and the other problem people have is\nThey're not saving enough and so this gentleman that came in he was frankly behind he had not saved enough money you know he was just a radio he was one of these gentleman that that had never called in you know listen to us for years it's just fine with you I'm going to call I just want to know what I Need to do\nAnd what was really cool about it as he was way behind on his savings I mean he wasn't worried needs to be by him and I sat down together and this meeting and created an entire roadmap\nHe actually was able or will be able to get right back on track have everything in these were comfortable retirement and we were able to map all that out in this one hour meeting together and and the and the gentleman ... says\nHoly cow I Can't believe how much you just help be you said I had no idea where I was\nOr if I'm saving enough for what I Need these that I had no idea about any of that stuff so most people have no idea so the first thing is ... ... you know you're not saving enough you don't know your number what is your target I'm going to help you build that my job is to make you more financially successful they are today right isn't that simple\nAnd when you call for your CPR you're pointing review with me you want to sit down with me and and meet and just talk a little bit and warned for me

or ask for a copy of the book when you call will send you a copy of the book as well but\nWhat sit together\nRobert we only have less than a minute left and less I've known him for a long time we've been personal friends before we ever put this radio show together you've built an amazing financial practice and I just can't implore [noise]\nPeople enough to call your office make the appointment\nIt doesn't cost a penny there is no obligation no one's going to bug you but for people to come in and just bring in their current investment strategy their current portfolio and just let you look it over and give them a second opinion\nFolks you you're leaving valuable information and a potentially a whole lot of money on the table by not taking Robert Harward up on the offer

that Robert ... wrote\nFirst ten callers eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine get the book\nAnd also make the appointment eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine and we'll see you next time [noise]\nTo find out more about financial advisor Robert Harward and the hard way call Harwood financial at one eight hundred three nine five\nFour to seven one eight hundred three nine five four to seven nine for online the Harwood way dot com [noise]\n\n\nThe proceeding was a commercial program paid for by Harwood financial the opinions viewpoints and promises made during the proceeding program or not those of W. H. N. Z. A. M. its staff management or parent company I heart media incorporated\nHelpful\nBought our first our radio ads\nAnd ultimately that close but we had last weekend was endemic of us the average American bullied break out but I Believe that he should be confirmed and the United states than it actually went ahead and did what we want it says sliding scale of morality and all told\nWe only had our public opinion changed by seven percent that entire process that was at seven percent in other words most people are pretty stuck in their basic morality [noise]\nA lot of times people will go you know how is it that this friend I've had over a year turned around and stab me in the back [noise]\n[noise] well that's all part of the sliding scale morality and I'll tell you how it's playing out you've seen in your own life no doubt [noise] maybe with your friends certainly with anybody you discuss politics whether you might disagree with\nIn just the overall frustrations you might have about politics in this country let alone the moral outrage the moral outrage by the media on back of Kanye visiting President Trump here's how the sliding scale morality words\nUnless you're potentially responded Satan you're probably not evil so how hold out the possibility I dunno Chuck Schumer I've you know so maybe you know as long as you're not the the sponsor saying or or maybe Chuck Schumer you're not pure evil and none of us are perfect\nSo on a scale of one to say that one is evil ten is perfection we're all too is to nine\nAnd therefore at our best were really having a good day and where our best versions of ourself we're going to be at the upper end up whatever our morality is let's say you have a really honest in decent person really honest a decent person might be an eight\nMaybe on their worst day there are five now what does that may well means that\nI'm not going to hurt you\nEven when I'm at my worst I'm not gonna hurt you because I'm a decent person more than that let's say that you start out on that sliding scale morality your sex\nAnd so you're a decent person throughout much of your your life but when adversity strikes when something goes south what happens you slide back three not just suddenly were three\nOh sure you're going to hurt somebody if it means taking care of yourself if it means putting your interests first you will take others down\nThat's how the sliding scale morality wars that's how people will stab others in the back when you have thought they were your friends\nKind of get the idea here so let's talk about the sliding scale of morality a little bit so many people so many people have been reaching out been frustrated how is it still\nBet you have people that defend Christine foreign how is it that you still have people that will say that Brett Kavanaugh's rapist when he wasn't even accused of rape by the way\nWell I mean by anybody other than I have an Audi I guess\nThe answer comes down to the sliding scale of morality if you don't have\nA real moral compass you don't start out in a high place the morality to begin with\nA shoe you can make it up as you go\nEvery day you view of things through the prism that you create a\nLittle bit later in the show I'm going to talk about you in climate science and what frauds they are along with Medicare\nAnd the fraud that is Medicare for all its financial fraud the conversation the reality it's fraud bunch of people lying to you\nBut it's all part of our morality today to where I can lie to you\nIf it suits me and when politicians do it and it works you're going to get more of it and people will embrace it to the extent that it makes them feel good\nOr to the extent that it justifies their existence and I'll give you an example I've always had this rule that if somebody reaches out to me and they don't use profanity I'll get around and and respond to them this was a listener talking about Christine for and I mentioned that\nHey she committed perjury and she I Believe should ultimately be tried for it\nNow I had somebody saying well her witnesses the ones that ended up refuting her claims\nMaybe maybe they were the ones who weren't being honest and this'll asserts that there may be many reasons why they refuted the claims one of which people could be they didn't remember another might be that they didn't want the death threats to their families oh okay cool\nCool so you can committed felonies whenever you feel like as long as you're reasons are good enough\nIt fit sliding scale of morality and when we're talking about this sliding scale morality and we're talking about Kanye West and the moral outrage by the media are you kidding me are you kidding me Twenty years ago today\nWhat were we talking about and what did you think of when you heard Oval Office\nIt certainly wasn't about the president of the United states it has something to do with what was on that blue dress\nAnd so for the very media\nThat sucked up to William Jefferson Clinton to have moral outrage over profanity being utilized by Kanye West in the oval office\nThat is one heck of a sliding scale of morality and that is the world we live in today and so more than ever before it's important to know\nWhere your moral compass happens to be or you five or six or seven and eight where are you where\nWhen you're at your best where are you when you're at your worst when you are inviting people into your life who are they\nDo or they\nAre they six is on a good day and three is not a bad day\nLast week I was talking a bit about\nBeating your head against the wall a lot of folks want to know how do you become more persuasive how can you convince people things politically\nAnd I mentioned the unfortunate reality which is you have to find people who are open to uh to information the first place and the problem is that a lot of open minded people out there as I pointed out with a cabinet deal there were only seven percent of folks top to bottom ... ever had their opinion changed about him seven percent through everything that's it\nSo you've got to find people that are open minded and open to information as I pointed out a lot of them happened to be younger\nBut at the same is true when we're talking about who are engaging in in our lives if you don't want to be frustrated if you don't want to be stabbed in the back\nIf you want to find people that can make you feel better about yourself an add something positive to your life you got to figure out where their morality is because anymore\nA morality is on display each and every day and it's being perpetuated by a political party each and every day including by a former attorney general who\nHappens to now be saying oh\nGo ahead and kick the opposition that's the world and we now live in ... so ... for ... and well look at how far we've come and just Thirteen Years\nI remember the last time we were talking about Kanye West and the president\nWell that was a little bit of a different story and over the past Thirteen Years a few things have changed and ... who is working right now and a few things about this economy and that's where we're going to pick up next right here

politics they're meant to divide they're meant to cause friction division they're meant also importantly to do what keep people down [noise] [noise]\nWhat have we seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their minds remember was talking about just a few minutes ago sliding scale morality but also finding people who are open minded now historically we've seen well over Ninety percent\nOf black adults vote for Democrats\nNow when it with any group of people we ever agree Ninety percent of the time but why is\nThat for decades hell we'd had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus it's time for a Democrat no open mindedness no division of thought\nBuying into the identity politics but nothing ever changed and we see that we're still the country where a man\nFrom the poor neighborhood in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and a Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world\nSelf made near billionaire you can also\nLike Donald Trump and be a Republican and that is the problem because that is where the Democrats get exposed as soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity\nAnd the one thing if we take a look at George W.

Bush was a racist no I did I go\nDuring the country and the relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes I was I miss memorized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that entire thing was that you blaze yes\nIn fact actually I went back in and watch that but a lot of uh the the little series there ah earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today is that was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was a combination\nOf everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time looking he'll look a gun you look at the teleprompter elected gone yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran he said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts [laughter] but yeah\nAnd that is bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers\nPicks up ... starts reading the dumpster and all the time moment anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to Institute policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have the success you need and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success with somebody what do you have to do you have to prove to them\nYou can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates\nEspecially with the black community that's a Donald Trump story so you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a raises Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nIt has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare it's providing\nPath in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you how to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing never forget I've lived many lives even though I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\nIt's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going\nBe I I um I had a smooth the company had a manager there one time\nAnd uh end up getting a call and call came from a government office during a unemployment verification jak verify the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone over to the employee and conversation takes place I could tell after a couple of minutes that it was good she's getting upset she's getting really upset [laughter] it was like OK gets off the bone as she tells me\nYou know what to do just happened I said I'm making too much money\nA single mother just a single mother and she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took a catalyst that a gang change like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black and I'm going to back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment the\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well of course open change when I was much bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at him\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keep an economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need them okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nBut what do you see\nYou see somebody like Tania who obviously is not an ideologue ... not a Republican [laughter]\nCasper
