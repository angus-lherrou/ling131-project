Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses\nOut of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels I stood up and I said no to that not SATs when I found those lawsuits\nAnd President Trump well he's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia we need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes and then ultimately deregulating\nSo that regulations fulfill a more basic purpose\nMarkets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either\nIndividually or within our communities where on the local level when you have federal regulations in place there has to be a very compelling health safety well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution\nAnd that's part of the problem with the rock Obama era or they went so far beyond the pale President Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote and the U.S that it would have power Schumer and that radical team that\nDignity means bringing the paycheck home\nBeing able to put food on the table and provide for your family\nThirty years I fought to bring in the back to those who lost to after an accident Vernon\nAnd because we believe the bigger the it is also the heart of our charitable contributions\nAt our fight for them to the energy the most expensive utility for most Americans is their electricity bill adding to your financial Missouri this allergy season has been one of the wars in years and that was the perfect time to order a new set of HPV vaccine is from filter by dot com with over six hundred scientists to choose from including custom often\nYou'll find the perfect ... ships free within twenty four hours with filtered by dot com they're made in America\nEmails phishing attacks cost businesses billions annually in real cash\nData law and brand damaged fishing emails are hard to get attacked because the messages appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees are introducing barracuda fish line a groundbreaking cloud based solution designed to ... recognized sophisticated\nEmail phishing attacks through interactive training reinforced by continuous simulation to transform your employees from a liability into a line of defense ... barracuda dot com slash piano to learn more [noise]\n[noise] ...

to you\nAnd I'm Serious when I say I think about the power we have if we make sure three four five six seven people who we know and who will vote the right way to get out and vote think of what election idle really looked like\n\nIt is in my view particularly in this election you're patriotic duty\nTo take care of business here\nI really believe that you're patriotic duty this is not just another election\nIf we lose their grave consequences\nAnd so rather than have anxiety and frustration\nPut your energy to work\nPut your energy to where you don't need people to tell you what to do you know what to do you know how to get other people involved in voting and so forth as your own precinct worker get out the vote I brought a number of candidates to you there are still up on my Facebook and Twitter sites who need your help in close races\nA number of candidates\nBecause I told you I don't believe in giving to the party bureaucracy I Believe in giving the candidates [noise] so\n\nI Would encourage you to look at them and support them and hopefully most of them will win on Tuesday but some of them walk but the goal is to make sure most of them don't lose but most of them do it\nAnd I can't get down into every house fight but we have like forty seats\nThat are close you may live on one of those districts\nOne of those seven districts in California one of those six or seven districts in Pennsylvania one of those three districts in New Jersey one of those four or five districts in New York\nThey're all over the country you may live in one of those districts\nVery very important\nThat you get involved\nEven in your own life that you get involved with a handful of people and make sure they vote and imagine if you do that and then a few others do that and so forth and so it would be a big deal it really would\n\nIs there a silent majority and if they\nWere about to find out are the poles right are are the polls wrong we're about to find out\n\nBut we should be focused like a laser forget about the static we should be focused like a laser you know you love this country and you know there are candidates out there who do not their\nCandidates out there who want to fundamentally change America I don't want to fundamentally change America I Love America\n\nYou know an Hollywood Bloomberg\nSpeier Soros and others many others multi billionaires

start analyzing what's going on a very good about this when these returns started to come in Mr producers and the Trump campaign around eight o'clock eight thirty I said to Mr producer Trump won this election so what do you mean\nIt's a leading point in American history and what's going on now is that the media and want to cut short or the advances that have been made they\nThey want to create chaos and they want to create hatred and jealousies and so forth but on their terms which is why they are not only rooting for the Democrats the when the house and the Senate\nThey are the
