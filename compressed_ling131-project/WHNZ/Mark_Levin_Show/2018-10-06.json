from the standpoint Brian of hey senatorial moment because I think quite Lindsey there last week it\nWasn't on the floor of the Senate didn't have all the trappings but Lindsay made those that are members on that Judiciary Committee either eat their spinach\nOkay ... ... what they need to hear I don't think they pay no attention to it but he took a stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait to

all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of [laughter] but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham's find this moment as

liberal side of things to get an idea the media it sucks in this country All right and uh I don't have to tell you that [noise] but\nIt is a really easy to information early\nAnd empirically tell you who in what John Paul Stevens is because anytime you can find a Republican in this case a lifelong Republican [noise]\nWe get an idea about John Paul Stevens former Supreme Court justice he is to the

thing [noise] summers are fun [noise] and I wish more people actually do their job\nBut what you don't hear about folks that sacrifice everything\nAnd there was something that happened here yesterday that\nCriminalizes this perfectly for the entire country now the sunset and I'll\nGive you an idea or adjust\nAnd the grand scheme of awful\nWhere they stand\nOne of their a major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here this is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron dissent is for governor for years after endorsing Democrat\nRight\nFrom the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantages for governor ... years ago the Florida PBA indoors the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyways are a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently is a Democrat but as a serving now the saint Pete area but uh anyway by the time he actually it was a Republican governor in in Florida\nRubio ran him out of the ... what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said this Santas would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies\nQuote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell for ... ... said this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the for the PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is sorted that police had been treated unfairly in recent years the quote\nFrom the president of the or the police benevolent association\nAs we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media and politicians which have resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said\nAnd the my blood boil boils here but the the\nWhatever you want to refer to this\nPose or\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for this until he ended the article with this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nCall myself down\nBy morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mothers that their children in the car you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what may need so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke\nMost economic and and I was\nTracking violence towards police officers remember before the whole cap or next thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they want to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them and all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country\nAnd I noticed that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South Florida\n... that tracks the violence against police officers\nAnd here you have someone posing as a journalist who has the audacity to say he didn't offer examples have ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\nWell I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative advanced\nBut here's what's real\nIn this story remember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics as they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor endorsing round is saying is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled\nAnd until this week\nHad ... and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and forward about the ... for the police benevolent association with more officers dine line of duty in Florida than any other state in the country\nHow bad it is and yes this is specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country [noise]\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police as a result of the boys being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement would then kicked to the curb by special interest groups by media\nBy politicians [noise]\nAnd it's exactly why I started a series that I did a couple of years ago\nAnd in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position [noise] [noise] yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop\nGet ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a bad apple\nBut almost every one of all\nGood people put their lives on the line every single day for us and it is our responsibility now more than ever to back the badge and spread the word\nAnd sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent [noise]\nHow is it that we've made progress with those that have been long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that word skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that may be cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference [noise]\nSomething that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen and we have seen over the past year plus exactly that\nIs it anywhere near the entire we said no but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggest that we have a responsibility [noise] and that kind of cost to import people in the competed against the most vulnerable\nIn our society [noise] if you're really cared about the most vulnerable in society
