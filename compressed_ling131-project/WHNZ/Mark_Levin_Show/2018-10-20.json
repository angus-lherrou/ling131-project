color you are white and always angry white men they think I'm In and so when you when you specifically say I'd like to hear from women boy I can tell you I've been doing a talk radio for years now with the didn't big markets and across the country and when you ...\nThe women I like to hear from you boom those phone lines just explode\nBecause let me tell you something there's no way you can grow and expand the kind of of communication product that has been growing and expanding for talk radio over these last decades by just being\nA just targeting angry white men it's a myth it's a lie\nThat they love to say about what we do here because they're ... they don't want a new generation of listeners the last thing they want\nIs for a men and women in their twenties that's when people start listening to talk radio when they're done with the idiots who play music and and uh blow the the ... a bicycle foreign and ring the cowbell and make jokes about a body parts and they they start to you know get real jobs and have to wear long pants\nAnd have bills and are making money and they see how much is getting taken out of their paycheck\nAnd they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know what's going on out there\nAnd it usually happens in your late twenties early thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious way\nAnd it terrifies the mainstream media it terrifies the gate keepers in the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets radio television newspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge of the Internet\nWhen was the last time you actually bought a newspaper I mean unless you ride the subway in New York when was the last time right\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they put the lie out there they put the lives out there that this is hate radio that it's

they've been here for years\nThey're law abiding and they pay their taxes and they've got jobs can you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or
