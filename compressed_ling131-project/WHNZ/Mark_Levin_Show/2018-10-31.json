they protect us and in a different ways they do it it's not a propaganda book it's just a good solid American book 'cause that's what my father was a good solid American\nTheir investing and the tax plan and just general financial planning\nThought that's a great question I'm going to tell you that we have to think of two different groups of people you're either an employee eat or an employer right so if you work for somebody and you're filing your tax return it should be positive for you because they're going to increase your standard deduction\nSignificantly on your tax return and it should save every body that is an employee that pays taxes some money on your taxes that might be one thousand to three thousand\nDollars which is what I estimate and that's a really good thing you still want to put in your four one K. is you still want to save for retirement but it's going to give you a little more money that you can put away for the future so that's wonderful that's if you're an employee\nAnd we have a lot of employees will help you know people that work for companies and we showed them ways to reduce their taxes and tax strategies\nEmployers we work with a lot of companies and owners of them ... you know ... of companies in town that maybe have a few employees to to maybe smaller mid size and we help them with their finances they have a lot they can do they got more things\nAvailable and more war tax tools available so if you're a a private practice you know an accountant a physician and attorney\nIf you own a business\nAnd you're not being a W to employ you have ten employees twenty employs a thousand employees\nThere was a lot of things available to you in this tax plan and we're already helping our clients do this so we're already\nPutting the strategies together for them were showing them how to take advantage of this plan because my feeling is this plant unfortunately is temporary I Hope is here for three years to six years who knows\nBut with a big deficit out there in big debt out there or that thing has to get paid down and you can't pay down when you're reducing taxes so the good news is we're going to create jobs were going to stimulate the economy the market's going up all those wonderful things\nBut I don't think that's enough to handle a twenty trillion dollar debt that is increasing every single year not getting paid down so let's take advantage of everything right now on your taxes come sit with me uh let me teach you what I Know go ask your advisor questions your tax person questions\nAnd between us we'll show you how to save money don't just give that money to Uncle Sam\nKeep it in your family I'm really confident I can show you a better way to do things business owners man there's so much we can do to help you it's unbelievable\nAnd again this is just a classic example of why you should call why should you should make the appointments why you should sit with a ... team they loved to help people they love to help their clients they loved to bring new clients\nInto the financial practice who they can financially help through better returns better investment advice lower fees helping to navigate the tax issues if you don't have\nA guide let the Harwood team guide you instead of you know walking around bumping into walls is what it comes down to eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine is the number eight hundred three nine five forty two Seventy nine and just say\nI Love to come in and meet the Harwood team and get that second opinion on your portfolio\nBob Let's also dive into\nOne of the side how do people know if they're not saving enough money for retirement\nYeah that's a that's a great one you know this is a response to this gentleman I sat with the other day\nThat wasn't sure he is he's doing his forties I wasn't sure if it was saving enough or not so we always talk about knowing your number and there was a recent study done that said eight out of ten

them this Sunday ten pm\nMine is the last of the shows without reruns on Fox\nOn the weekend before the election on that Sunday\nAnd I'm going to do things a little differently on that show I'm going to uh do a monologue and I'm not going to do it normally but I'm going to do it in this case 'cause it's an extraordinarily important time in our history and I'm also going to have an expert on the program to go through a number of races that are very close and I consider very important\n\nWe're truly battling\nA very bleak force they very dark force in this country that do not share our values and principles they lecture us while they attack us they tell us to tone it down why they call our president Hitler\n\nAnd there's many big it's among them many like Don limit of CNN\nThe thing he said the other day is a fireball offense or Steve Schmidt on MSNBC another big it\n\nAnd the things he has said and I've gone through and look these are firing offense is but the executives the corporate executives on the boards of directors\nOf these companies Comcast Time Warner and the rest they obviously want this they want a divided country they want the race baiting they want the anti Semitism coming out of the media\n\nThey don't want a United Nation the United nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations in these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nOr we're going to talk more about this is the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again the birthright citizenship\n\nYou are hearing people who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar there that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president as aware of that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it\nOr what have been done already they said the same people in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the laughs at some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no not things that birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what\nPaul Ryan said\n\nEffects the case that house a statue gonna fix a statue won't fix it because they're saying you have to amend the constitution\nWhen's the last time we actually amend the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned way it's been a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps or\nAs we discuss the other day\nAs I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship\nWas not actually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies that Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and the statute was passed so why do we have to amend the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nAnd as much as this battle of a cabinet was so crucial he's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia\nAnd neither is John Roberts\nIt's just what it is\nThe president happens to be right about that the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happen to be wrong\nHe knows more than they do\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they when they when you have the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship without left\nCherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous presidents that plane meaning and purpose of the fourteenth amendment sovereignty and the social Compaq\nWalk collectively ignoring enlist uninterrupted case law
