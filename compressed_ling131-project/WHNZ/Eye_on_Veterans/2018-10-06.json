to say Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance with guy go go to guy could not comical eight or nine four seven out on the hard part figured out which way\nIs easier okay Bucky chargers raiders tomorrow ooh and John drew in wishes that Darwin James was on his team yeah I saw you write and read a lot about this this week I'm In full agreement\nWith what you said about John grew in but why don't you kind of a a date for everybody what your thoughts are on the way he's behaving on a weekly basis\nIs unbelievable that a guy who is those are the football program\nContinues to take sides of the general manager when he is ultimately insurance he was in charge of the draft he's in charge of everything he's in charge of every transaction that takes place it has to run past John ruined when they gave him the ten year one hundred million dollar contract they made him the leader of the organization\nHe gets to shape the team and the way that he sees fit is built and in his vision\nAnd the like and so for him and I understood it look it's kinda like the coach thing if any coach will always falling over the opposing\n... owners top player and say oh we love to have a guy like this or whatever\nBut for him to go so far as to say that he wanted their when James and that because they had failed to draft safety the previous two years he couldn't get him to me it was unnecessary shouted Reggie McKenzie everyone knows the over ... isn't there they know that ... Joseph is narrow relegated to second team duties\nBy bringing it up you only you're shedding light on Reggie McKenzie and so if you can sit in and say like oh people are trying to take us support especially right after the ... rate when it was obvious that that was a John groove thing that origin McKenzie pain because while McKenzie\nTrade away someone did he drafted into tough five and who has lived up to the\nThe hype for it to the status that he was drafted yeah it's all jak room so to me is the franchise that is in disarray and he is kind of created some of the dysfunction\nTotally agree with all about and and I think about it this way I'm a bosses in charge of getting the most out of his employees\nSo let's let's talk about the collateral damage of these statements that he's just made you talk about it from the status\nOf Reggie McKenzie and I get that and there have already been reports that those who are not long for each other and because of ruins contract we know which one's going to go it's not John So Reggie McKenzie has probably gone after this season okay fine so we could all deal with that\nBut let's go to the players so when you make the statement he made publicly I wanted to drive there when James ... we had drafted safeties and the first and second round the last two years\nAll right so how did those to safety is now feel based on your statement for sure how does the first round pick you did make codes and Miller\nSteel after you make this statement and this is not the first time he's done it when he treats ... back a few weeks ago and the following week publicly states man great pass\nRussia's are just hard to find [laughter]\nSo I mean go beyond the ridiculous news of the statement and take it to the past Russia's you do have\nNow I understand reverse psychology but you can only do that part of the time and be a good boss at a certain point you sound to me like a guy who is just on a daily basis with one in three football team ripping the rug out from underneath the feet of all the people who you're trying to get to play well\nYeah it just doesn't make it just doesn't make any sense like code Miller got his first big and bold accounts and when we say that he is a pretty well yeah he'll never Donald Finn why bring him into it because he obviously has to be able to see the quote here the quote and were like wow you on the Germans have but you got me like does that mean that you don't\nLove me like you said you love me like what what is that what does that mean and so for John grew in he knows everything about being a head coach being those are of all", "show_name": "Eye on Veterans", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
