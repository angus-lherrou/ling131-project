... two teams major media mark you know what are they going to charge ...\nOr one of their discussing what about the housing they see a lot of things as they are discussing the viability of the judges in LA how's the conversation goes they can't go anywhere right\nSure stinks that we're in a way where they go on it and you know a lot that what do you what what what is it how does how do\nThey still have to figure out how can they maximize their presence in LA right what they'll do they doing can they feel more Pierre cells can make it where the generating more money\nWhat happens when the answer on all fronts is no no no no they are generating less money they in those meetings in fact to change their outlook on revenue for a year one in the new stadium for four hundred million down to a hundred and fifty that's now more money that's a lot last\nRight so then how can they find a way to bump that up can what where where are you at your so negative\nNegative pills you really want to ask you about your negative net how my negative I'm an easy to have an attitude adjustment ... made a little more ...\nHold on hold on you tell me what a negative about today\nIs nigger when I was like look they don't talk about how they can possibly\nGenerate more revenue how they can OKC fan interest among other things you like they can't they want they can buy you know they can't by putting the winning products on the field and that's how they are doing it right now nobody cares they actually ended up winning at a major level do yet I'm saying they make a run like look because remember this\nThis LA Rams fandom is two years in existence last year they tease them\nMade it to the playoffs this year they came out\nHot okay everybody's on the ... you know charge just haven't done that way shards of been the tour is slow starters\nGo to the playoffs this year get hot next year you build momentum heading into when it's time to get into the stay\nA into minutes I Will tell you how that has absolutely zero chance of working or being reality but there's way too much on this bone to rush through it let's get David ... got in here with the latest on everything going on that\nYou had been pretty negative today\nWell you know what the way I look at what are you guys were talking about I have a six foot two white guys if you walk in you Dave said you know we need to figure out we need to figure out how we get marked at Dunkin basketball my answer is going to be kept I mess up being negative\nLord of the room well okay a different way you want to move the goalposts for the chargers put you on the trampoline on whatever we had to do so in other words you're suggesting under the chargers cheat ... well that's what you're suggesting where are you\nTrying to suggest the charges would be more profitable in San Diego than Los Angeles one\nThousand and one million ... really are now\nDo you want to get rid of it and I will you let them read to prove let's go to the forest valuation do you know where they are right now in the form valuation NFL is probably the bottom five or no not quite bottom five twenty third you know what they were before they left no they're twenty second\nOkay the ram [laughter] how'd you were saying they went down Dave they went down by the ... exact down east behind us yeah do you know what the rams down the rams went from twenty seven students third\nListen we are the are they went for the St Louis to Los Angeles have you're buying into real estate rhetoric no you're not it's not real estate that don't have any that's the point he doesn't own the stadium number one\nNumber two I can find twenty stories on the Internet this week about the number of potential buyers and the NFL is going down because they're not enough people that have six hundred million dollars to stand\nThere are very few and they're not going to target a team that hey doesn't have any real estate and the can't sell them ticket oh that's all your time what you're talking about the charges not the rams was fine I mean I'm not talking about the rams\nBut you talked about the value with the ramps and how they had moved up as well why Israel charger I own a stadium yeah I Know I understand that but you're talking about a ... a charger team that had to move from San Diego to Los Angeles because one they had I learned that did not want to pay for ... what do you mean it's right or a wreck\nI can give you a source report that tells you about the ballot initiative they put forward in San Diego was specifically designed to lose so that he could get out and go to LA I I understand that bought into what he thought was going to happen when he got here and the over flight as hell\nNo I understand that completely but I'm saying he wanted to leverage the city of San Diego into paying for a stadium for him and that is why he left San Diego at that rhetoric I'm seeing the same thing I did I\nKnow that's not why he loved San Diego he never wanted to stay in San Diego\nBecause he thought he'd make more money up here and he was wrong well I don't think that the prophet of the team would be far and away exceeding what it is in Los Angeles then and then they go you\nConsider the expense is the fact that in San Diego he would owned his own stadium do you realize the amount of money that they just gave up in their projections for the new stadium for four hundred million down to one fifty gee nobody could have done with that two fifty\nYeah but he doesn't want to spend his own money to pay for a stadium he\nNow is he spending six hundred million and ... he just gave up two hundred and fifty million because he thought he was going to sell a bunch of tickets that he's not you guys are not seeing this is a disaster or is the reason the owners are talking about it in New York is not viable\nI'm not disagreeing that it's a disaster I just don't think that there's much upside of being in San Diego especially when half the stadium is usually fill up the opposing team's fans any way more than a dozen of them is falling apart\nIs one thousand percent untrue prior to five years prior to the leave when fans stopped coming because he started threatening to leave\nI mean I I was living down there for quite a while I start living down there and two thousand two and I know from first hand experience because that is not rhetoric who thousand\nTo is the year I covered the chargers didn't miss one home game are well is that all of them I mean I've lived down there I was doing his name act the way I didn't get all ... all charger crowd that was the year the Damien Thomas in and Drew Brees we're rookies and it was on fire and it was a man Diego crowd at those good for a handful of years\nYeah I'm In ... started sharing with everyone what about ... years and everything went into the toilet I mean and it's that's the charges for you that hey sorry if you have an update I'm Sorry I just\nDid we had a lot about my bread and butter subject for me I I Know you take that very proud to say talking or you're not allergic to all your guitars not per se but I Know a thing or two about I mean I've I've never I don't either I Do do you\nYou do but they they're so much rhetoric out there and it is so full of you know what it is so so bad what the charges ownership has put out to the public that is flat lies NFL is welcome listed in the whole thing you know this was a disaster of epic proportions and if you follow the money and followed the behavior\nYou'll see that I'm right I I wrote the owners are not getting together in New York to talk about this for no reason\nIt was a bad poker hand that he played and then he came up and ah and got beat I mean obviously in a\nBad hand too so uh speaking of plenty of football today are going from the NFL to college football got two teams in the top ten right now Georgia just score but the ... lead lead number nine Florida twenty nine to Seventeen Oklahoma hammered Kansas State Mac fact this game still a continuing\nUnder seven months to play in the fourth quarter Oklahoma fifty one Kansas State fourteen ...
