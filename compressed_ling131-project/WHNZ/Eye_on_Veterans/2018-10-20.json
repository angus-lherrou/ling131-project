David ... will have the call of number five LSU against number twenty to Mississippi State\nAs LSU coming up the win over the number then number two Georgia\nAnd Mississippi State coming up a win over Auburn just a couple of weeks ago coming up in a few minutes how did the by we prepare the bulldogs of Mississippi State for this game right now we're going to go on the shelf pencil performance I run a head back to Baton Rouge and\nJoining us Greg macaroni be part of the ESPN television broadcasting Greg let's start off with LSU they're coming up that huge went against Georgia any chance this could be a trap game with Alabama coming up with a couple of weeks\nI Would think that it would be like everything would tell you it's trap central right like down game right before the by week like you're bound to let up\nBut Mississippi State beat LSU by thirty last year so I think I think there's some real then that's factoring into the tigers preparation this week they seemed\nIt seemed like that a certain level of urgency it just\nThe guys are not happy about what transpired on the field last year and start also they remember they were reminded um so I don't think it's gonna be a team that they overlook\nAnd this is going to be a team they are going to see on the other side with Knicks Knicks Fitzgerald when he's been able to do with his legs the SEC is offensive player of the week last week or how is Fitzgerald a you know coming off injury last year and then uh the losses earlier this season how's he kinda transformed his game\nWell he's actually they've reverted back to ...\nBut he's most comfortable with like before the Auburn game\nIt felt like Joe Morehead and this off as his staff they were trying to kind of forced him into a little bit more of a casserole because if you look at what Joe more had had last year he had a great thrower and trace mix or are they like the office and\nWas trying to become his balances possible because if they rely too heavily on the ground or the air it\nDoesn't work and it's as max capacity and they essentially looked at ... said man we love you but you're not a thrower ... you're just not you're not accurate enough to run the office that we're trying to run so let's scrap everything\nAnd let's go back to the drawing board and they did and they came out and ... Fitzgerald right it almost thirty times for almost two hundred yards so they basically went back to more of a wild cat style of attack and if Nick Fitzgerald's gonna drop back and throw it thirty times again they're not going to be successful so\nThey went and they threw at Seventeen times against Auburn and\nThat was the perfect number and I would expect them to have a similar plan tonight to try to run the ball control the clock and play with that great defense on the other side of the ball\nDrug that was going to be my next question I mean they're not going to give balance we know that they found that number they like is it sustainable to win with that kind of imbalance\nActually yes uh when you have a group that set up like Mississippi State there's a few things that they have they don't have to a great speed\nThey don't have a great explosive ... but they have size\nAnd they're very physical and they're great on the fence so what they say they'd All right cool three hours in the cloud of dust what's the role you know it's ... it's actually not all that unlike\nLSU when less miles was here I mean that we're gonna grounded pal you know what's coming and we're going to run the quarterback thirty times and you're going to like it like that's kind of who they are and and it's it's it's in Deering\nAh and it's challenging against teams like Alabama and LSU who pride themselves on taking away what you do on the ground and they might not have great success against some of the best defenses in college football but\nLooking at their defense on the other side if they score Tony\nThe likelihood of them wedding is is pretty dang good I mean they are allowing twelve point the game so they have been a they're going back to the drawing board but they're just rely on exclusively on trying to beat you up and maybe at the end of the game those body blows delivered in the first three quarters\nThey start to set in and they can lean on ya and those four yard runs become Fifteen yard runs in the fourth quarter\nScholar triple live as we get you set for LSU and Mississippi State here on ESPN Radio borrowing Greg McIlroy will be on the ESPN television sign up for tonight's game what has impressed you about the LSU defense of late\n[noise] well they they have star power that's that's the first and last week's performance\nAgainst Georgia was pretty remarkable um actually Georgia ran the ball pretty well early\nAnd that essentially went away after the first quarter and part of that is because Jim Cheney the officer coordinator for Georgia kind of a band in the past and more on that later [laughter] if you try to throw the ball against the secondary good luck to keep the ball if you throw for more than\nTwo fifty more thought for us to shine some light

you'll hear all about it and see clips from what a scene it was ... more on that in a moment it's all in advance of tonight's game\nIn Pullman between number twenty five Washington state and twelve ranked Oregon out of the pack twelve north and for more on that game are college game day crew on ESPN Radio with Brad Edwards and Trevor ... here's ...\nBank you mark okay Bret and Trevor let's go big picture here with Oregon and Washington state a lot is being made of Oregon maybe being that last\nChance for the pact well to get into the college football plow being that one last team if they went out there in what about the Washington state side of this why are they getting as much respect\nI don't know I I I think it it must be because people don't ...\nThe Washington state can went out and they're sold on the idea that Oregon could now certainly uh Oregon has uh most of it's more difficult games already behind at Washington state still has to play at Stanford still has to play Washington so I get that part but if you compare the schedules\nWashington state schedule well neither one of them is difficult a bi national standards Washington state's might actually be a little bit tougher\nThan what Oregon his space so I just think from this just looking at it the way the selection committee would I don't see any reason why Washington state if they win this game wouldn't have just as good a chance as Oregon what if they went in\nAnd bread those implications are huge but the show is going to be spectacular because of the quarterback symbol\nThere's a lot of talk about Justin Herbert the Oregon quarterback as possibly being the first quarter back taking them to draft\nBut hey Washington state's quarterback gardener issue has played himself into the conversation as to whether or not he should be the first quarter back take it in the draft that it's not because of empty yards that he gets from the air raid off and it's where my reaches a master at creating space so that he gets the stats\nHe makes it difficult throughout the advance throws in the face of defenders in tight man coverage you can make the back shoulder throw he can throw that the dime in the alley there's so many things that he does that are NFL level rose\nAnd with a deep grouper receivers I mean I expect this to be a high scoring game and I'll tell you talk receivers watch for number eight of Washington state you stop Winston he's one of the best receivers that gets overshadowed by some of the other high profile guys around the country watched number eight this'll be a spectacular fireworks show or tremors that\nWashington state opt out new rules that Oregon off that they get this one I Know we're all looking at it from the playoff perspective\nWashington state doesn't care I mean just to win the pack twelve north you realize how big that would be for them I think sometimes you know our our big picture view is out of whack with what it is for some of the teams that we are talking about and this is a great example that are you there would\nBe the the icing on the cake of of game day being there for the first time in Pullman what a scene that was the sport is ... back to
