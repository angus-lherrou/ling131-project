{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "Thursday off by the Houston Texans looked at take down to Miami don't\n... Thursday at seven thirty eastern on bond you now [noise]\n\n\nFar greater those good way to get somebody switch the guys are going to guy could I comment in Fifteen minutes you said ... percent or more money coming on the car insurance [noise]\nAll right so the buccaneers just won a miracle a Baker Mayfield is a a is a gift for the uh Well Don young like him standing on the line with his mouth just gaping open cannot believe that that still going through\nThat's gonna be the viral clip of the day Washington got a bumble from jak press got they've got the ball\nAt midfield party leading seven to nothing and right now the ravens the football still in their own territory [noise] I guess the thing is it a scoreless game but I have a feeling of is is that what seems fantasy owners want to hear I have a feeling there's going to be a slog today in Baltimore\nOh yeah you know and and you could tell that John pain is gearing up for that all of their plays including they're passing plays were close to the line of scrimmage they're trying to neutralize vote rushed by getting out of drew San fast and emphasize the run game and so when you do that\nYou go a long drive their opening Dr went for twenty please they couldn't convert at the end they get stuff done for them to where actually they get stuff they fumbled on a pitch where that Jason hill in there\nAnd tried to pitch to Mars so did not work out for them\nIn suing drive or here in action now since the fence on the field and watching thing getting going early against Dallas and that's exactly what they needed to\nAlex Smith part of the reason why he's in Washington instead of cheese quote still it's because he's not that type of quarterback who can play come from behind football right and so when you have a lead and you have Al Smith the quarterback\nEverything's going well when you're playing from behind things get off the rails quick and so seven nothing at home against the Dallas Cowboys division rival really good start for the steam\nYou're so right you can even just see if you look at the Washington team on television\nAnd from one week the next the whole energy the body language everything about them is so different like oh I remember seeing them are in the money that game against New Orleans where you know it was ... celebration light and so that was just set up to not be there at night\nOr but from the get go you're like my gosh Alex Smith cannot completed passed\nThis is this whole thing is just drab ... and there's nothing going on everybody shoulders are slop looking away they started this game against Dallas you got an early touchdown everybody's hopping around everybody's jumping around Dallas looks like they're completely out of sorts even though they absolutely cross Jacksonville\nAll last week this is a great example of how momentum in the NFL regenerate every Sunday Morning\nWell and it's funny you mentioned Jacksonville that's another team that has to be a front runner or just teams where you have limitations with armed strength that quarterback like Blake board all ties like Alex Smith hot you absolutely need to play with the lead and you're always play your best football with a weed whereas Drew Brees Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady\nPut them behind the eight ball in the fourth quarter they still have a chance guys like Alex Smith Blake ... you have to give them a comfy read and then all of a sudden the whole team looks better they looked like an incredible football team but as soon as they get behind things dragon so that lack of dynamic a quarterback\nIs something that the Washington Redskins are gonna have to protect\nIf they're going to have success of the season in division\nAlso mentioned the forty niners and rams are underway the rams in all yellows today and the forty niners are all whites today so that traditional\nRed versus the blue and yellow that's all out the window and it looks like a color rush game or versus the opposite of color Ross it's all yellow versus all white or the rams lead this wide\nScreen and off thing in the forty niners looked like they did with bathroom last year which is good enough to stay in games but not good enough to win game\nYeah I agree with you about third again is one of those guys who is a really talented backup when he comes in the wheels definitely don't come along and you can keep the train car on the tracks it's just not it's missing the magic that Jimmy gee gave the bay area and they're missing him a lot out there\nAre brother great stuff as always week seven in the national football league will continue as we do ...\n[noise]\nHey it's been matter here everybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pick up some milk here's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything\nAll you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance that extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one

[noise] downloaded\n\nPart of the best part and right now I can talk to Kenny Albert who was on the call for the Panthers at the eagles and what a comeback was Kenny as the Panthers were down Seventeen nothing and ended up winning Twenty one Seventeen or let's just get to that now at what point did they get it in gear and were able to make some ... what was the what was the difference\nWow what was it a third or fourth quarter to seven in the late for that you don't like it was you know twenty water quality or nothing at that point where the eagles were dominating\nCarolina on the first part is that just three three quarters I talked to all our thought twice for your call I don't feel go rent on time so an eleven minutes left to seven and all of a sudden it was like a\nA you know the sweats and a lot of wind up scoring touchdowns in the last ten forty one fourth quarter back in franchise history it was an incredible a front and a lot of once a quarter of the game and pulled out the\nRoster three or four now they are probably wondering on Thursday the jaguars next Sunday\n... [noise] let's talk about Philadelphia I'm\nAh raining Superbowl champs a lot of high expectations coming in Carson wins coming back from injury and there are three and four under five hundred at this point in the season what what is it that you see that they need to do to be able to finish these games being up Seventeen nothing in the second half\nRight at your it's funny I mean three quarters they dominated on both sides of the office only watch was having a terrific they are let's say a couple of running a ... of course but uh you know what ... day\nOld Shawn Jeffrey up some pledges for the first touchdown some really nice cat just to spend drives and that's the way they were getting the job they're shocked that knew a couple of times in the first out than it was supposed to do it for the eagles really three quarters and then all of a sudden the Panthers\nThe more than a couple of long drives and then um there was an interception\nAt one point or ... you know they called it that what your goals were driving towards the end of the game but the charge a lot of the fence wound up doing a terrific job on the next couple of places in ... he goes out to\nMake any you know when I look on the other side with the Panthers and and one of the things that I don't know if I'm concerned or I don't know if this is just the way they are and that's the way the amount of Russia's heat from an I've talked about this really the last few weeks and we said that\nCan do it and shouldn't lead your team in Russia is not as if this was college where the quarterback is going to rush Fifteen twenty times he leaves them today again was seven McCaffrey at seven as well attempts I mean is this recipe to win for them or can they finally get some more rushing attempts and more rushing yards from someone else\nRight you're right and I know\nNorth Korea has today it like to have a nice balance um that are going to have you know last week the outbreak that went through all\nFour times I think on the first Rodriguez wash that have been able to get out of all the rest of the game not to use them in a lot of different ways they're leading receiver got the fat out of the bill are they doing like also back down three games this was just that that can you start to get what it costs down so that certainly\nUm you know at a record player but it wasn't like that or a bigger balance some nice runs today\nAt one point it actually add more\nCautious than than passing yards was thirty eight rocky alternative one point it only twenty yards through the air but um it was a profit on the fourth quarter you know up until then not much but\nI think the biggest play the game was an ... like a horse and whether or not but it's a complete authority over here you go that far short drive a lot for a lot of\nOur ... going forward um\nWhat is it that you think the Carolina needs to do to ride the wave of success and continue not playing from behind like they did today but not only do defensively but alternatively you know hitting on to the fact that they don't have\nA lead rush or do they need more balanced or is it going to be moving forward the same thing you do you know passing earlier or running early been passing late to me it seems like a great balance moving forward is the way for them to continue to have success\nRight and and this is actually the second ... did I think that's real Washington shut up in the last week but that was for a couple of turnovers straight or turn that over twice last week a return over as the first stop\nOn today's case it was just not step dries up during\nThe first thought thought but they probably wouldn't like or that a balance with running it shatters early play to the you know it's the backup running out to the cap rid of all of the yeah the ... all can't walk he was on one of their touch downs but all didn't go his way\nThey ask us ever so they're starting to develop Curtis Daniels a second you're out of Ohio State\nYeah Russian touched down today a war going on their first rough it got to Maryland jar is why it's been around with Minnesota you meant nice place today Honda Civic target so we all have started to see some of those other guys aside from a capri at Olson that involved off actually for the Panthers\nOkay we appreciate you joining us a up next we'll be the ravens for the Panthers up again the Carolina Panthers with a victory now foreign to thank you can say travels\nOkay I've got a right now\nHey uh we'll come back and talk about what kind of jokes about lines but they actually did get a big victory and there was a certain thing that was the key to victory will tell you what that is next is Fox football Sunday Fox Sports radio\nOne I think the two gangs\nLate one hundred sixty three\nAnd now when for in your city is a world champion\nWhen they'd be Boston Red Sox the Los Angeles Dodgers World Series coverage right here\nEven if you're a big basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know\nWhy did you know that the person who were actually peach baskets or is that a war basketball is bouncing than the cold one or the players could run as much as four miles during a game well here's another fact you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nIn in the ... the chemistry and the rhythm you were building\nIn the driver's off so as a starting quarterback you hate that yeah I mean it's the worst thing you can do in breaking your rhythm is to have someone come in for play and run a gadget trick play and then move on I I just you know but it seems to be working for Baltimore Lamar Jacksons\nOut a few touchdowns already and it it's kind of been successful for them so it's I think and mind you have some a hill the quarterback running back wide receiver for the states has been doing the same thing and that's what Drew Brees who is still Drew Brees right\nI think it's a little different when the guy who comes in and do people want to replace you with him right it is it different when you know it was the first round draft pick and they come in in your the ...\nWe're not worried about the Arab parents who Drew Brees no not yet but coming off Joe flag goes to preview seasons we were looking to replace him\nThe organization was looking to find the next guy and I think that has a lot to do with the ties into probably his frustration when they introduced at packages zone and so forth yeah I couldn't imagine\nThat for the guy who everybody's screaming you coming in and you write all the accolades 'cause he's only run it into the end zone yeah now you're still on passes for interceptions so we'll continue the conversation and uh some give you some highlights and updates on what's happening right now

Jackson is got him going in the right direction they get they got to be tough on them though they've got a you know buckle down\nAnd realize that they've gotta they've gotta play as clean a game that there's a lot of positives today's game\nI put thicker may feel I got better as the game went along I started to connect with drivers Landry that was a great sign I saw on the job of a second round draft pick and at a rookie running back have a strong game so that's a bright future there\nSo a lot of good things for the browns but they're not there yet they're still young and they're making a mistake and unfortunately they're paying for some of those are the stakes\nSam Rosen is our guest of course was on the call for ... bucks and just listening to me feel like a game is about to happen right now just listen to his voice said let me let me go to the other side of the winning side which the buccaneers this has been an interesting team I started off hot and\nRyan's fitzpatrick became fits magic and then all of a sudden it goes downhill and now you got James Winston back and he didn't have a great game but he made some play down the stretch and they also are was able to run the ball a lot fifty five yard touchdown\nWhen you watch to see what do you see do you see the team that maybe closest to the first ... team that's just struggling and it just may end up being five hundred this year\nI think probably close to five hundred because they've ads for injuries rather the fences side of the ball which could hurt a looks like a journal McCourt might be out for a couple of weeks\nA quandary Alexander got hurt in today's game they'll know how long he might be out\nBut if it's a knee they could be a while so they've lost the guy's a joy injury but they've got some good things going for ...\nUh started off the game he looked great he was hitting a every receiver it connected with ten different receivers in the game he passed over three hundred yards but he's got this little ... uh sometimes you make a couple of bad passes\nA cost of last week against that land with two interceptions and it hurt the team this week at almost was devastating studied true true interceptions today but uh they were able overcome it so and they still got to figure out what they want to do with the character at times\nCat in zero wins the game with a fifty nine yard field goal it's incredible but he also just an extra point that's three that Susan and then he misses the winning goal from forty yards out so they got to figure out what they want to do with him\nIn speaking of James the the the thing we know yes the town that we've ... we saw it in college Molina as he's been in the pros but the one thing and the one thing that can really do real talent in a quarterback in the national football league decision making with the football especially in the red zone like you said today\nYou do for a bunch of yards but he had those two interceptions it put his team in terrible positions\nAnd they've been trying to work on this with them this has been the ... the the point of emphasis for all of the coaches that he's had what", "show_name": "America's Health Care Advocate", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "21"}
