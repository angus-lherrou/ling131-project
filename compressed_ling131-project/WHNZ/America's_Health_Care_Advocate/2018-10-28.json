you\nMentioned because the reports are out a ... that was the best fan crowd that that they had\nA since they relocate in and even quite quite honestly prior to that because just the mere fact that they were contemplating this relocation they were overthrown by visiting fans in San Diego that final season\nI tell you what I Will I'll protect the names of the innocent but it's not just a report I spoke directly to someone who was out the game in London who works as a sideline reporter for\nA one of the teams involved and uh I was told by far and away the largest and most chargers partners in crowd that they have seen\nIn years certainly since they moved to LA and having the roots that we do in San Diego we can pass along because of dean ... rivers over the years the crowds in San Diego were at times not that charger partners then in the final few years in San Diego so that crowd they had in London last week probably the best crowd they've had in seven years\nYeah it'll be interesting to see how this pans out in Los Angeles but in the interim\nOr the rams are absolutely wrong thing people ah this this team is as strong as we've seen a ... and as complete as we've seen a football I'm In a long time it's a great defensive by weight Philips in some of the\nSome of the players out there they improved obviously within dynamic ensue Aaron Donald's been great for wild adding a keep to lead the markets Peters this off season\nAnd then there's ... everywhere you look they have a weapon on the field and golf is is right at the center of it him and Sean McVeigh has grown have grown over the year and a half that they work together\nAll right good thing I warned everybody that Matt reader would be limited today ah he's getting absolutely a ton of war Martin Arizona right who's take it all the carries seven carries thirty four yards although that may pass along\nHe did just leave after ... yard run and seemed to be favoring one of the legs and that's been the issue that's been the issue a with Matt Brita and the forty niners gets socked on thirty two so are there going to put the ball the way back to Arizona in what has been a thrilling two to nothing game so far [noise]\nAh yeah this has not been a great start to see them for the forty niners and it it's really not going to improve anytime soon\nHere on the road and are allowed\nYou did this by

you love to watch\nWhen they were helpful\nBought our first I ... [noise] downloaded [noise]\nTen and a half point favorite the whole world betting on the Green Bay Packers and it's not going well for Vegas 'cause the Packers are winning right now ten to nothing never in his career was Aaron Rodgers a bigger underdog that he was going into this game what are we watching here right now from\nUh LA teams come out little stagnant or maybe they'd been reading the press clippings are on the flip side of that was the Green Bay team really getting after Jerry golf making them uncomfortable they're not going to let them sit back there and and pick them apart with all those weapons they have outside they're going to come after them\nAnd we've seen a Aaron Rodgers find finally you know utilize Jimmy Graham early in his game which I think there's a difference maker in the middle of the field\nUm if the rams do have a weak spot it would be that area so I mean they come out with the ... plan or in terms of Green Bay and we see the rams kind of sitting on their laurels a little bit than uh you know\nWell I I tell you what the big played it set up the Packers first touchdown a passive device to Adams forty heart beautifully was I mean markets Peters is all over him\nAgain there are passes where you're saying there is no way that could be that\nAccurate from that distance it literally went right sue markets Peter's right into the hands of divides ... out of it in the book non poll label pass by Aaron Rodgers so we got attend the Packer labored watching right now now another game that flip that's on right now\nThe waiters at home against the colds this game open as up pick 'em like kick off any was anywhere from a three and a half to four point favorite but right now the raiders who have to be offensive tackles no Marcia unless you know I'm Ari Cooper are leading the colds fourteen to ten a maybe\nA took your quarterback crying last week for for you can do their own or allegedly crying last week for you guys get on the same page I\nLoved their early energy let's see if they can sustain this you know the the raiders this season have ah are very collapsible so we'll we'll see if they can sustain this four point lead and continue to put pressure on Oakland Raiders I mean on\nThe uh uh uh Indiana Indianapolis\nGo ahead and get the Indianapolis Colts Indianapolis ... or the raiders made apparently a message today that their car is safe now we know that doesn't mean anything I mean if the right off or getting on the table we've also heard\nThat if Derek car is not traded but he's going to be flat out released before next season to save a bunch of cabs space\nThis is an absolute do over for John grew into right now\nAnd this was a shock to Derrick car who thought we were just ... loading not rebuilding after it down here just two years removed from a twelve and four seasons so what do you make so four of the uh grew to experiment with the silver and black\nWell the thing is when you sign a coach to that type of job security with a hundred and ... and you're a hundred million dollar guarantee a deal\nThen this is what you get he gets to make decisions from the ... with absolutely no recourse he doesn't he's not on the hot seat he can lose every game from now for the next three years and still wouldn't be fired he still wouldn't be on the hockey fights\nSo you might as well take advantage of the ... when he was going to do what he wants to do if he doesn't like the makeup of the team now we all thought that their car was this guy he\nRaved about him when he had him when he was a brutal grinder and he had them in the\nThe quarterback bust the whatever that is and now all of a sudden a report\nComing out that he may be shopped or\nHe's not happy with them so you know looking at the quarterback landscape out there who would they if they traded him I mean who's going to be well\nHere's the thing about the raiders and and ... grew it in particular he's not\nA guy who knows how to groom a young quarterback right only talked a lot of young quarterbacks will remember the ... down in Tampa Bay and they went fishing resigned Jeff Garcia to save the day so um my guess is I mean they got

pm eastern time tonight it's\nClick and courage of LA against David Price the left to you so much ... Ballenger is not starting he is six fifty one at the plate this postseason betting one Eighteen with Fifteen strike outs not starting tonight it'll be ... Hernandez in centerfield\nAnd Matt campus still not starting for for twenty two is that what he's doing at the plate this month and the post season\nAnd the catcher's well neither is hitting Austin bar and starts in this game five tonight and a Barnes at the plate to for twenty seven as a hitter but the other guy ... just for for twenty nine with Fifteen strike out this month and left the ... Peterson is not starting against the left the Peterson eight for thirty eight at the play\nThose roles swinging for home run there you go you know swing for the fences every time\nSo they've done there's two years in a row and falling short of a title two years in a row it seems so will they actually wake up and trying to assemble a different team that's a serious question to management\nStrategy maybe instead of actually trying to swing\nFor a home run you go how about just getting the ban on the ball now that you didn't feel rally you play about make\nThem pay for the shift about advancing runners are not like we saw last night Justin Turner laid off single stands at first\nThey not here in the script Mr to say you got to follow the\nWhich is not working anyway game five on Fox TV tonight Cleveland Cavaliers fire coach to run loose today after and oh and six start assistant Larry Drew takes over the NFL game tonight is New Orleans at Minnesota as for the game's going on right now Adam military has become\nThe top point score in NFL history is key to feel go over twenty five hundred points he scored in his career and a half time in Oakland Raiders lead fourteen Thirteen over the colds\nAnd the rams falling behind ten nothing at home against the Packers at the coliseum about five minutes to go first to have this is the first time the rams had been down by double digits the season\nThey enter with a seven and old record\nAnd oh we've had more scoring and the niners game it's now five three niners leading at the cardinals with about four and a half minutes to go\nIn the first half of that one among the earlier games Philadelphia one in London twenty four to Eighteen over Jacksonville Kansas City seven and one of the season after beating Denver thirty to twenty three\nPatrick my home's four touchdown passes over three hundred yards passing Washington beat the giants twenty to Thirteen Adrian Peterson a hundred and forty nine yards rushing into total scores Chicago over the jets twenty four to tend the jets offense eleven drives just well first downs today jets running backs Nineteen carries only thirty five yards\nCincinnati wins on a forty four yard field goal final play thirty seven thirty four against Tampa Bay and Randy Bullock had missed an extra point in the first step that's why it was only thirty four all going into the final two minutes Seamus Winston through for interception was pulled late third quarter and then some fits magic Ryan Fitzpatrick\nOff the Ben thank you John Cusack and he's non union my goodness Seventy two yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter for Patrick Adelaide duty and to point conversion to tie it and still Cincinnati gets the home when\nBy the way or the forty niners that lived in three lead over Arizona [noise] they just run can lead Jansen in to say the only one in the last ... or they're looking guy but\nI don't think it's going to happen not a good move there I'm Mr to say good thank you so much a good time at the game tonight we're coming alive and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios easy to say fifty percent or more in the car insurance we guy go go to guy got ... eight on an eye for seven out of the only ... which way is easier joining us right now\nHe was at that Redskins a giants game when Kennedy Albert I'm\nPam Oliver are different Charles Davis and Charles ... and I were just talking about Adrian Peterson Mm hundred and forty nine yards twenty six carries an angels won or or ... what do you make of this man still putting up these kind of yards\nWell it's it's really one of the things we haven't seen very often you know we just go ahead and make it historical this is John Regan's if Gore territory because no one else is doing you know has done that and now remember Adrian has to get to a thousand yards or for him to get on that list with those guy\nBut he's well on his way this season and when he plays like this and when they're able to create space for them that he created his own space as you guys well though\nWashington becomes a better football team and when I mean we we graphically showed it today in the law says you remember the New Orleans ... when he got hurt and then the other last July Indian out the like twenty yards or something like that so and the other games he's averaging well over a hundred yards per game now\nThat tells you how Washington plays which may be a little bit different than you would expect from a J curtain team\nBut he's riding a wave right now and Adrian Peterson leading it I I\nAnd I and I think that's the formula for my you know Alex Smith is a ... a leader that team and when we were talking about him he's not going to burn up the statue he's going to be\nExtremely accurate with the ball he's not going to turn it all turned over but when you give 'em a dynamic running back Adrian Peterson it takes a lot of pressure on him trying to stretch the field all the time and we see\nYou know him twenty for a thirty two hundred and Seventy or yards in a touchdown ... interceptions\nThat's what you look at that's what you like from him being able to him the ball off thirty three times to a bevy of running backs mostly Adrian Peterson they ... that's going to be our recipe for success because when Adrian has Nineteen and more carry he gets up close to the ... century mark\nYeah and and the one thing that I'm looking at it [noise] ... [noise]\nIs just to stay in a book or Washington now is formulas work well for a number of other teams the one thing I I'm going to keep an eye on and I see them again next week against the lab\nAnd they end up in a game where let's say Atlanta's cranky they've been playing much better off and you've got no recently\nWhat if it turned into a little bit more of a we have to keep up [noise] that's where I Want to see what Washington going because what Alex out last year in Kansas City ... rarely get rushing also can catch it out of the backfield but he also throwing out at the time we kill and and it traps\nSo when you're talking about two guys ... down the hill who is doing that for Washington Jordan read is a terrific receivers tied at I've not seen the bigger place for him this year and and who's doing it outside they haven't had that guy so far is that going to be the interesting thing with their formula what happened to someone stretches them\nAnd make them have to do a little bit of chasing and in a dynamic fashion Atlanta could be that team to test them that way next week it will be fun to see how they play\nCharles Davis is joining us on the flip side the giants are now one in seven manning was Sarah seven times he wrote a couple of picks a they threw the ball Barclay only thirty at yards on the ground and he had Seventy three yards receiving your evaluation Charles where are we with the giants now [noise]\nWell that off into line unfortunately is not getting better you know they kept hoping to get some type of\nHay in the middle of the season these guys come together and get better I don't know that that's going to happen\nIt's a makeshift lie to begin with a ... or who they put all the money into is not in the rock that they've ... they they expect it will hurt and added is going to be good at guard but he's a rocky\nAnd Iraq got sacked seven times and I watched it it felt like more guys you know you have a lot of pressure he was knocked out a bunch there was a lot of times when he got rid of it what you got to understand so that's a problem for them\nYou mentioned say quants rushing totals they can't run the ball they can't move people and the Washington ... ... those young young babble voice ...\nThey get a lot of attention in Iran paying job that Alan but the guy who showed up today in addition because those guys were great was it was a an item that either it's bad apple two and a half stack it was out in the game so you can't run the ball wash it makes it hard for you to run it\nNow you gotta go deal with the the secondary but a lot better or with the army you to see what's going to have that with that but with the giant Evan open week and then I Believe their game is on the road I don't have the schedule in front of me but believe they're on the road\nYeah they are going to be at the yeah\nIf they're going to test the young quarterback ... at a time when I don't think they have to do that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "America's Health Care Advocate", "city": "Tampa", "day": "28"}
