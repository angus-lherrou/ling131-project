appreciate it thank you and it's just been one of those daisy for we're going back to back to back talking to people who are calling these games right now is our man Charles Davis who was that the Panthers at Redskins game Redskins get a victory over the team I pick to represent the NFC and the super bowl and I was in her phrasing myself on how regular pick that was where there's\nA but they do fall and the Redskins were able to do this or get this victory when they really needed it and uh the defense came up at the end big when the Carolina Panthers had a chance to win what was the victory Keenan victory for the Redskins Charles\n[noise] getting out of the gate fast guy I mean you take a look what they've done this year go back to the Arizona games they want to\nGo back to the Green Bay game that they want to check out today\nThey lead from the front Jake route and told told us when we had him before Green Bay we aren't aren't running team we are not come from behind team but he didn't say that with a lot of uh how would you say praise in his voice\nYou know he loved to have the team that he feels like make a return and pick it up late but he has not seen that from his ball club\nThat was getting off the bat starts well check out the numbers against Arizona Green Bay they got off to start winning and today they got up to a fourteen and nothing start so when they do that they are different ball club make you chase from behind it they play a whole lot better than they did that to Vegas Carolina\nI talk about how uh important ah Adrian Peterson has been to them and their three when when you look at their three wind he's had a you know an average of a hundred yards rushing in those three I went and just feeding him the ball really takes a lot of pressure a of Alex Smith how important is he to this team\nHe's very important to them and it's actually been a little bit of a surprise I don't know how many of us thought that when he signed with Washington\nThat he'd be able to be the bell cow that we would look at baking that over sixteen games he's going to make this and of course you know how he is he hears that he gets crazy it's like the red cake and brought up a ball the charges\nAnd you're exactly right I mean Ninety six yards in the winter there is older than he comes back with a hundred and twenty two touchdowns gets green bank control that he has another big day to day so when they do that as you mentioned take the pressure off of Alex Smith and and throwing the football\nI don't you know we hear the word balance all the time I don't know that I hear it with as much conviction\nAnd the city as I hear when I went to Washington team talks about the on the ballot they absolutely need it they got it today for Peterson and it all sorts of line I think played a really nice game that remember they missed a couple of key got only ... starting to center case really start center played guard today again because\nThey ended up a shovel valleys been versus Indianapolis can't say that that makes them both\nHey Charles we know you're going to go so I hit you with one more I Want to go to the other side of the ball the Carolina Panthers of what what why aren't they as explosive I don't know it seems like something's missing what would you say a is missing from that often so from that team to take them to the next level\nI think that the the ability to get the deep shot where you're going to ... play that you that you're terrified you think that it's Torrey Smith\nOkay guys after sixteen yard to catch it as career but we haven't really seen that from him yet he had one of his better days today I think it up catch the ball game to game with only seven catch a year\nSo who's going to be that one Curtis Samuels back off the interest left and he should be the guy but he barely was even mentioned today I think we mentioned bought a kickoff return\nGetting Greg also back helps McCaffrey helps but they've got to find a way to take the top officer defenses and open up more space for those guys underneath otherwise people keep stepping forward stepping forward it started to took real grinder up a game for them and I think we had a little bit of that today it got to get somebody to press it down field\nRight Charles we'll let you go man we appreciate your joining us talk to you or hopefully next week\nIt acts like I don't see ...\nSafe travels or anybody else you want to get in any run up and they become a mom I Want to the games what what'd you think mom and I got my stepfather I Know he was watching the game in what the the but the\nTo hit on the Carolina Panthers and I know that was just ... it was you know you're gonna be different ... last Saturday and tell her anything there quietly doing X Y and Z lead doing that and I'm like yeah okay are you know you got it\nBut they don't have big play capability that's true\nIn the running game or in the past in game\nAnd until they figure out a way to straighten my Charles Hussein stretch the field everything is being done everything you know two three four yards here maybe nine your route they don't have the ability to really push a defense back\nIn the secondary to open up the field and you just can't be all screened ... let me ask you this thin\n[noise] he's not him\nOkay follower I'm going okay well why isn't Christian McCaffrey more like a ... rolls like are there are rules had much many more games where he where they don't use them like that\nHas the capability why do you use them like ... I'm not saying he's him for sure he's not that but he has those type of quality so un are sitting here you're out the game I'm just you know a fan of the game and we see this why don't they want as their office recording at coordinator say\nYou know there's we have to find a better way to use this kid 'cause it's like you said I Know we can catch I Know it can run I Know it can do screens and we can do you know all these different things wildcat or anything\nBecause the onus is always on Cam Newton we have an office of coordinator who ... who puts the boiling cam Newton's hand Cam Newton was the leading Russia Today again nine attempts forty three yards gruesome McCaffrey at eight for twenty yards\nThe the the team in the offing for the Carolina Panthers is set up for Cam Newton right it's it's cams show he's going to rush the ball he's going to you know pick the targets you want to down the field\nThey just don't have any big play guys now if they were to come in and say look\nWe're going to set this up and we're going to use Christian McCaffrey as an all purpose guy we're going to put them all over the field because he is a tough cover we're going to put them in motion put them in a lot and we're going to let them amounts I mean that's a way you could open up that often but\nIf they don't have anything coming out of the bag feel the difference is going to go oh go go for that\nGot to find a way 'cause you just mentioned it and you said that a candidate was their leading Russia again and and he's doing that a little bit too often lately and again it's not even like he's running", "show_name": "America's Health Care Advocate", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "14"}
