mystery of where's your first round running back\nRay shot penny and and we don't see this very often you know when you watch your team invest first round money into a player usually very is ownership and executive pressure\nTo play that guy and so it's the one thing to say look Chris Carson is clearly out played them so that's going to be our guy right now we're going to use them in okay fine but he's not even the backup\nHe's not even getting he's not even get you know Chris Carson miss the game last week Davis comes it runs for a hundred yards as they can't blame it on the offensive line any more than ... back to back when John Rodgers a I think it's definitely cause for concern for shot petty\nThere are times where with rookie is and um and this has happened many times from my plane career and then afterwards following the game\nWhere it comes a point where the coaches sort of make up their mind and be a consensus\nDecide you're taking a red shirt year and I don't know if that's the case in Seattle yet but if you can't help now\nAnd these coaches their whole lives depend on winning\nOr you're not just talking about the the head coach you're talking about the assistance to what happens do assistance when the head coach loses his job\nBy by it it it's like when you clap your hands loudly by a flock of birds it's ... they're gone and so this is an issue and and when you don't have a play or even if he is a top round talent\nComing out performing well sometimes you say okay we're going to pump the brakes we're going to let this to develop and ... and I think that's

rams trying to answer the Seahawks touched outside of girly takes a little catch up on the fly\nAnd we'll take it into the red zone so first down to the rest of the Nineteen but it's an interesting started this game still late first quarter nothing to worry about yet but you do wonder I even joined sailor told us earlier today Sean the base where the factors seems not faced any adversity yet\nAt all for all all seemingly I mean not blowout wins it didn't blow the Vikings out um and there goes girl in fact inside the five now to be first and goal\nSo ah you know they they've been in some ballgames they were trailing the raiders at half time on opening night so I get that but they have not really been challenged hard in the fourth quarter of a game you wonder if a road trip to Seattle today might be the day\nWell I'll tell you it's a challenging environment I played a couple of games in Seattle and it is one of the more uh active venues as far as the twelfth man's concerned and I believe we have a girly touchdown I guess that's the ruling on the field that the rams have gone down the field and had their way with this ... defense much the same\nThat we see every week out of the rams offensively this this feels like a judge or not they're receivers are all playing exceedingly well they're running back is playing exceedingly well they're all friends of mine is playing mean and\nThe quarterbacks dealing there aren't too many weak spots so yeah you have been hit much adversity but it's because your powering through all of it\nChargers raiders game I'm looking at this right now or the raiders just got a penalty on Melvin Ingram I'm Still confused especially as an ... a former office of wind and maybe you can help me I'm Still confused as far as who draws who all sides when everybody's moving before the ball gets now who's the penalty on\nWell what what happens is if a defensive lineman incur encroaches in the neutral zone and then end up and said Wyman responds\nThan it is defensive off sides or or you call it encroachment right and so that that's what you see when there's a ton of movement that usually means that a defender fell into the neutral zone jumped out of his stance on off into why minutes trying to grab the easy five yards\nOr the extra point for the rams is up and good the Gurley touched down his confirms southern tied at seven

Rosen looking pretty good\nAnd even despite you know they're getting that first couple of plays when he came into the game and they said hey man what was it as fell a few games back but now he's a he's doing this thing is he has a team fourteen of fourteenth six but\nAnother team that I feel like we're not talking about enough is the ... and I actually picked this team to represent the NFC and the super bowl that is the Carolina Panthers a\nTough when there was a difficult when today a credit the giants were stick it in and hanging in there and finding a way to actually take the lead\nBut then of course the Panthers or when it on a field goal um which is harder to nowadays even extra points to heart you know there are ... I Do know and that's what's funny about it the season has been the year the kicker one way or the other missing extra points ... missing field goals and you saw Crosby would end up being like one for six today yeah\nI mean my goodness but are they actually get away for the the Panthers where are you at what the Panthers right now as far as the NFC I mean again I had them\nRead is that there are things that I Know you had I'm representing their three one or the thing that they don't they don't scare me that is true I'll give you that I I don't I mean have you that they're going about it you know end up in a in a\nVery pedestrian way you know you know they're ... they're winning games no one's looking at um really and then you know and we can you look in about oh snap\nYour evidence three are eight and to you know what I mean that that\nThat's the end sometimes that's the season you need you need to focus to be on the rams you need to focus to be on other teams the the there\nHe could have been the falcons come right you know you need that\nSo you can just block out the noise and just go budget but at the ... the year that they had when they went to the Superbowl they snuck up on people and you know and they haven't been the same sense and so right now you know winning games I'd say one of the day I mean when we know kicked the sixty three yard field goal\nOutside no altitude in the ...\nSome of these other teams with the struggling of your ... do you show that like I had a sixty three are filled or you're messing thirty two yards and extra points they were like look\nIt's the end of the game\nWe can get another yard he could have got they live with every five or a A R let's\nJust go for it right let's just go for it and this is how you become part of the team\nRight you all guys you won't find guys to talk to you in the locker room this is how\nThis is how you become now I Know I have an image of them walking out what's that what's that going to what's going on and like ... ... from a big bang on Monday and you're just\nLike excuse me I can I help you where you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "America's Health Care Advocate", "city": "Tampa", "day": "07"}
