Kimble blows this game he's not making it out of ... there's going to be a button press that's going to give it to see him disappear through the earth the pitcher's mound all he's getting his panels

you oh national debt relief offers programs that help you escape overwhelming credit card debt national debt relief has helped tens of thousands of people just like you reduce more than one billion dollars of debt\nTonight and obviously those failures\nSeveral endings in a row with multiple runners on base your only able to late one extra run to get it to five five three before judges home run but you had a number of awful and\nBats and guys not taking pitch right not standing in and and just trying to extend what had become\nFairly miserable outings were potentially miserable outings instead and the box score it's going to look oh they did just fine you have the the any a third of an ending from workman two hits and an or on a walk a strike out and then the home run that Kim role gives up opposite field the judge\nOtherwise it's going to look nice and clean that you know you gave up two runs their sale\nTo in his five and thirty five and a third innings pitched you'll take that and you'll run all the way through ... you spotted a five and a lead in in a way you go\nYou know and who knew he would work that would still be out you know what it gets it done I was always going to go Vince Workman but I decided to go that's good yeah that's a good reference to them but here's the thing is is he talking about bad at bats with runners and scoring position\nIs in the sixth inning the Yankees start knocking sail around he comes out of the game they're into the bullpen now\nMiguel Angel Har walks after awhile pitch\nWorkman comes in walks Gary Sanchez on four pitches laboratories comes in and swings at the first\nPitch out of the strike zone and that sets up the entire at bat and then he winds up on a piece on on a full count swinging at a curve in the dirt for the final out of the ending that was a horrendous at bat\nFrom laboratory I understand yeah he wanted to have you back to ninth but there's tourists he's one of the best players on the on the teams are all star this year wasn't as great in the second half but still you have to be smarter in that situation you got to get rather\nThan just walks the guy on four straight pitches and after you have a walk the batter before\nYou got to realize the rented this whole ballpark now is on edge that their pitchers can't throw strikes and you help them with that that was a horrible at that stands out that it looked like he he was swing defensively bunch swinging for the fences it was it was it looked like he was completely out of whack and how to sink\nAnd and that ... was was awful as well but they had a few at bats like that's nice those are the biggest ones because those are the ones that came with the bases loaded but still I mean I'm done that's what I'm shocked that the most the Yankees having that many bad at battle you'll you'll like\nAggressive work at the plight especially on a a pitcher struggling but also here in in a playoff series where you are now crawling back to try to steal one enemy smart gotta workouts and know that this is the weak part of their\nTheir squad right if they're going to need to go to start it was like they did bringing him for cello you know you try to force the issue as best you can so that that advantage plays out even if you don't get back\nTo even and when this one that you at least extend things and extend those arms that they are

back to back home runs off of Couric looper and they pulled away from the Indian seven to two\nI did and just being at the score and where we're at we're just we're a little aggressive going door pen and and the Penn did a great job force to allows to really get back in the game and give us a chance and [laughter] and we almost caught I'm\nStanding in the back they aren't interest so that was our guy standing\nIn the back they have a gym\nOn the Saudi dancing and we almost caught I'm\nStanding in the back there\nAnd it just felt like such a big switch for you guys from kind of just stay alive after falling behind so early to really kind of sound like an opportunity last maybe towards the end of the game with the with the people that you left home base and that in the back to back bases loaded situation\nYeah um and and you know I I Do credit them a little bit in the fact that you know they they did a good job of minimizing in staying away from trouble against us and staying away from damage against us [noise] um but yeah we just couldn't get that really big hit that\nTo to have that beginning that really jumped is back in the game in the middle innings and I thought we did a good job attack in a way a good job of giving ourselves opportunities and and just ran out of time there but um yeah we just couldn't get that back\nBreaking hit that that allow us at the beginning\nI can [noise] and when did you think of sailing and was in the heart and prepare for him just because he's ... now\nI think it's you know your ... [noise]\nThe ... the same and what his stuff is you know usually dictates how much six that she can potentially have against some so [noise]\nUm I thought he was good and um you know not as dominant self necessarily um but I thought he did a really nice job of mixing his pitches changing speeds you know his changeup slider where a factor\nUm you know he could reach back for a little bit on the heat or when he really needed to so you know I think he he gave them a strong out and there's no doubt about it in and did a good job I think of keeping us off balance enough\nUm you know we were able to get his pitch count up and get them out of there and then uh you know keep calling back into it but overall Saudi Saudi pitch pretty effective against us\nBack corner CIA [laughter] Aaron how much of a luxury is to have a horrible and like you do and is that something you feel like can be advantageous for you going forward in the series [noise]\nYeah um I mean that's one of our ultimate strengths you know so [noise] um you know this is we're going to get to where we want to go um you know the bullpen is going to play a big role in that\nAnd ah you know they they stepped up for us tonight and and and allowed us to get back in that game and then you know get the job they pretty much done all year for us to less [noise]\nWhile I was in an oil it's\nPretty well were you surprised to see him\nMake that switch and go to ... early in the game [noise]\nNot necessarily I mean we saw um warming up and then once we saw him warming up we figured he'd probably start the eighth inning um\nYou know obviously breaks than a really good pitcher forum and him and we were able to kind of work through some guys I'm In in the set up the situation so were you know getting down towards the end so I don't think we're real surprise up or so came in\nAnd uh that's it for the ... like I'm trying to pay attention to Aaron Boone but when our guy as they're making those calls that we love so much it's hard to I'm just waiting for him to finish them go to a gym inside and ... yeah I was a little didn't even\nWant to do with a Aaron Boone is that he had a great opportunity when asked specifically about Chris sailor preparing\nFor him for sale gave one of the greatest answers in a press conference ever when he was asked about preparing for the Yankees can you give us you know talk about your success in your history against Yankees he\nLooked at a reporter just said no\nI was kind of open air and not paying like hey you want to tell us you know what did you see you know can you talk about what happened tonight no Phil Jackson on that you did it off the Phil Jackson's Trita silky though can you tell me what happened why you got fired fell below\n...

different head coach who might be able to steer their energy and other ways instead Pittsburgh continues to create its own drama every week it's the gift that keeps on giving for the media\nYou know the funny thing is I Am as it normally these are the games and and the stories that we focus on what goes on off the field and how it plays into what happens on the field\nBut I Can't tell you the last time I've been there six sided for game where it's all about what happens on the field in an everything off the field is is irrelevant I Can't wait to see\nThe cheese and the jaguars on Sunday I Can't I Can't wait to see this is Patrick ... homes have enough to get past this the one defense that seems like it is designed to stop him\nI mean this is this is irresistible force immovable object I Can't wait for jaguars jeez I never thought I'd say that ever said two years ago you know I Can't wait for jaguar sees you would say oh this guy's crazy but that's how I feel about Sunday\nRight and not judge Broncos\nWere laughing like workers okay let me in a minute don't come on a wild animal that came I'm watching regardless I mean you know this was this is not jets games non jets games I should say [laughter]\nI Wish I really wish Leonard for networks like I really do you know just to give tactical a little bit more punch may be that they might need and that's you know because\nIt was ... given up only fourteen points a game and I think Jacksonville defense you don't look they have respect around the league regarded as a great unit and all that but it was a a season so far to the first four weeks where we've had record setting off sense of numbers and that's all everyone can be is talking about look what the jaguars it done right\nI mean the one laws that they have they gave up nine points you almost always windows games those are often said spider\nSeemed to me and and I think like ... going to have a good game I really do this or chief teams don't forget to just coming off a road game playing on a short week and I just I'm not I I think I actually think jak can end up probably winning this one I maybe it'll it'll it'll all be proven wrong but I'm\nCurious you write about this deeper and said look we saw some things now\nThe jacks are definitely looking at on film or what it comes to okay how was it that that the Broncos were able to have some success early on look let's get Patrick ... ton of credit here they put up a hundred and forty five points in the first four games that as a most in franchise history for the Kansas City chiefs it has been absolutely amazing to watch it ... and you know he's\nA guy we want us talking Eric Fisher their life cycle about it this week\nYou know he he just said I said what was the key to coming back but he just starts ... and it goes past the homes\nYou know I mean they love them they're they're ... they love and what's not to love right fourteen touchdown pass through the first four teams\nThe second highest total in NFL history for someone to open a season and all those weapons city half but has but I'll tell you this I think Jay Lynn Ramsey I think he's going to be a great match up against pirates kill I'm

soundbite how upset he was not being able to pitch in game two and he's\nSo now how this plays out on the off season but right now it's like we have the Dodgers feel like oh we got Clinton pressure

in the front office\nWe don't care if he's if he's if he's a a real Thomas doing it if\nYou had to leave that to come back and he was going off amount maybe what if what people off that I I don't know [laughter] but I I thought George\nVi and like you want a big league playoff game\nAnd just pointing to his own history a little bit of self deprecating which I thought was pretty nice touch because obviously they upped up\nAnd there's as you said that pause\nBefore the response measured calculated knows the gist of disappointed but you still have a job to do it still a big league playoff game

gonna say\nLook at the guy next to you I think you're going to see a guy so here's the thing about ... is he's doing this whole thing\nAnd and you know you're going to college on daddy's money earlier in the show we address this comment and I admit I was not I did not explain might take well enough and I did not explain it well enough on Twitter and that's on me and that's my fault\nBut when ... says you're going to college you go to the games on daddy's money\nI said earlier the show well yeah of course because that's how kids go to college there parents pay and I did not get into enough debts on that and that's on me somebody explain a little bit further right now 'cause it's my fault\nI did not mean that oh parents just pay and and write a hundred and fifty thousand dollar check for college okay you're going to go to college does some people who are lucky enough to have parents who are rich get college makes them right there but my point was that most kids generally\nTheir parents help pay for college don't pay for the whole thing because you have student loans and you have did you have all kinds of stuff but generally\nParents helping not all of them but generally parents helped my mom and I had a deal when when I graduated college she said I'll pay off the bigger alone and you pay off the smaller one that was like great meanwhile the bigger alone was like three thousand dollars more than the small boats with okay fine\nI celebrated my twenty ninth birthday by sending out that last check I was like OK took me eight years after I graduated to send it out so I Know this is how it goes and I was lucky when I had to spend I Can't imagine the check how long it have to pay when I graduated college now 'cause back then\nWhen I graduated Syracuse was like Eighteen thousand dollars a year now it's like sixty go ahead I Can't pay that although I'd\nI'm well aware of I mean the northwestern ah loans and everything that roll through\nIs always go to community colleges she'll go to Santa Monica community colleges are great Carl's junior right there oh it will be awesome but my point was that generally parents help pay and my point was to say that and that that's how ... how how well do you think people go to college they get the chance\nA parent's help them by paying money that's just something that normally happens so that's what I meant to get out and I did not explain it right and that's on me and that's my ... it's all good\nAt least on some percentage you're looking at either by taking out a parent loan coast signing for a loan so if you screw up\nOr they come back and take your parents' house or what or just money out of pocket right there is going to be and I did this for a living for a few years after leaving northwestern is

a high pitched\nUh we have\nMore NFL on the way because we are going to take a look at the two big gains won a preview for this weekend coming up next but a big story today out of the NFL and I can't believe we're still talking about there's Brian but we're still talking about as bright\nBut you have to hear the audio\nJerry Jones pretty much close the door on a reunion with as Brian today does Brian is still trying to get back in the NFL and now at this point I wouldn't doubt that there's this whole plan was to sit back and wait for the cowboys to call in\nAnd say okay we need you are often thinks ... says we need to come back I wouldn't do that that's where he's at because he turned down stupid money from the ravens you know he went to visit the browns and wanted more money yeah but I was ridiculous and and so how is not playing when he's had a chance to play when I'm sure as aging has told him\nHey does take this money this is the best it's gonna be na na na na\nHey here's an offer from the browns that on that and\nThen he goes on Twitter any attacks everybody attacks the cabbies he's not getting\nHe he's a drama guy and that's all he is and he's hurting his own cause but I wouldn't doubt if the biggest thing what he wanted was hopefully to come back and the cowboys are bringing back like that's my ultimate goal in this they release me but they'll bring me back but there's still love\nMe yeah there's there's still some of that but just think about if he'd been smart enough to sign the deal in Baltimore running opposite John Brown and what they're doing with that ... you know that could be a lot of fun as you could have gotten some of those numbers back\nHe should be under achieving in in Baltimore now it's the talk of oh sorry\nUh bought funny might have talked up the oath wacko is the lead again that might or top oh Joe Flaco could really could be so\nThis is Jerry Jones kind of close the door on does Bryant earlier today doing a phone interview now remember this is Jerry Jones talking about jazz Brian's why do I need to say this because you need to remember this is Jerry Jones talking about jazz Brian's\nAnd no one wanted to ask as a response to that but as you know we're friends to say the least we're friends and I have a lot of\nPride in where that is relative to our relationship as it pertains to him as an individual I'm Mira feelings of that nature it just seems like ... cowboy but we've got to look at\nWhat we're all having to deal with and that is what's in the best interests of the day so um that's a different story there\nAll the different stories 'cause he kept saying jak instead of desert I understand\nDoes that factor as we know what's on his mind you know Jack is a really got to figure stuff out but you know that as as jak is that reminds me Tony I think about Tony a boy or a who are we talking about [laughter]\nWell I think we could always rain just put the ball and is he kill Eliot get twenty five dollars and you say you're going to happen he'd be so confused\nJak desert Zeke all I mean for come on you you would you ... you wouldn't know what he was\nTalking about you and watch that sitcom when you are ...\nI think that's somewhere jak dozens each and that sound like it could be a good step got something that would be on like ... or the old spike no not ill where like I've been it was on last year and it stuck [laughter]\nWell we didn't get them twenty four seven and that that could have nobody needed that seems like that is a part of the team a jury he is a part of the well but he's not right now no but that's ... that's who I said\nNo but you're talking about but does Brian\nMay not play again in the NFL because at this point if no one has signed him to bring him in to a situation\nWhere he has acted full of drama since his release from the cowboys that's going to scare people off\nMaybe he gets a chance in the off season and going into next year team can bring him and his way to bring you in\nAnd we're going to see and you're not getting paid or not really going to pay you but that's really it he's got a look at things like I may be done in the national football league\nAnd he has he done because he can't play anymore or has he done because he wasn't the guy he was didn't take advantage when somebody wanted to pay him and now over the last few months teams have realized I don't know that we're a desert Brian away from anything nobody nobody is he's just another guy well no that's the\nProblem is that he was no longer number one yes he was you know going back and that number I had you got to be ... that he had turned into it to to be\nJazz Brian right he was no longer a number one wide receiver and wouldn't except that he was a two or three and that's where you end up getting into problems we seen this with many receivers through the years\nI just watched the empire strikes back and I saw the the ... guy I'm a who was in lieu ship and uh he was a a little bit to want to take on the empire by himself in a loop went back for Jack in a\nKind of kind of a dad or in the movie sorry that's a spoiler for movie that's about Thirty years old\nTwitter and how about a ... Mike swollen dome we got more on Clinton courage shows nice coming up\nAnd Fifteen but straight ahead the biggest games in the NFL this weekend we break him down pick 'em\nThat's Megan ... [noise]\n[noise]\nYou just\nIt's hard to just slapped that in there because it's hard case socks over the amount of beef postseason it's at\nGame to Saturday in Houston Garrett cold versus Carlos ... us go\nOnline car shopping in Macon using not anymore with troop Brian's from true ... now you know the exact price will pay for your next car\nIs it true car to enjoy it more confident car buying experience had just two games on the ice tonight hurricanes one at Columbus three one\nAnd this one has just gone final from staple center the shark beat the gangs three two in sudden death overtime [noise]\nLike you said you were a lot of from the guy goes studios were Fifteen minutes can save you Fifteen Percent or more car insurance more information\nVisit Geico dot com so tonight we watched Clayton ... absolutely dominate the Braves eight innings the longest playoff outing of this career could have gone out for them\nBut you heard him say after they didn't know who the pinch hitter was going to be due to pinch hit he would go out there because due to the left the but they didn't flowers came up so they went to Jansen to pitch the night\nAnd day Roberts talked about a comeback or that her shock yeah took that is hamstring tightened up a bit so how much that plays long term so no but the fact that he offered that seemed a little little out of sorts\nOr yeah we're going to hear from Dave Roberts coming up on a couple of minutes because he is doing a victory lap tonight oh sure Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday every night that's starting young general you over Clinton curse shot in game one was the right move\nBecause the Dodgers needed to move away from Clinton courage shock because they relied on him to do everything in the postseason the last six years and it hasn't worked out because Clinton crochet has been average in the postseason he hasn't been awful yeah it's been great he's been average he's five hundred and as he already has four and a half\nThat's been who Clinton courage shot is and the fact that the Dodgers have two other pitchers who quite frankly pitch better than him this season they saw this\nWe can strike a blow and do three things all at once we can get you to start game one at Dodger Stadium where he's been great all season erase one point one five and home and saved Clinton Kurdish offer game to we can strike a blow that if\nWe do this Clinton cursed Shaw may be pissed off\nAnd we may get a better Clayton ... in the playoffs because he feels slighted and in the end if he wants to opt out of his contract at the end of the year we know our future without him is going to be a good one because we have good pictures now that we can rely on Walker bealer is fantastic you is very good\nThey are driven and built through this line up in a couple of good pictures now it's not just Clayton Kurdish all or nothing they went to the world series and courage show Mr huge block of the season this year he was their third best picture they still one Ninety two games that went to the playoffs\nSo would you take a guy making thirty million dollars for the next two years with back problems if he's pissed off enough to walk away at the end of the year\nYou'll be okay all three of these things have happened now for the Dodgers because it was great in game one\n... pissed off you had a different edge to him we saw and his statements last night he was upset with being pushed a game to set it after the game tonight we played the audio from Ken Rosenthal on Fox Sports one\nAnd now the goes away you understand things will be okay for the Dodgers these last three games have been a change in the Dodger franchise dealer against the Rockies to win the west review in game one ... here now\nSome teams of only played one game in the play offs but clearly the Dodgers look like a different team that they were last year not just hungrier but a team that has more they can depend on their starting pitching rather than hope they get a great effort from the start because last year it was well we hope cursed jaws great we hope that ... great\nAnd then you hope that well he'll can be good or whoever else was pitching\nNow after this week it's well we know reuse going to be great we don't ... got it and now we know the ... Shaw is a different guy because he's really upset so everything the Dodgers what they accomplish this week\nThis has been a master stroke we from the Dodgers no let's\nSay you fought the last couple of weeks to get in you you go back and forth you have the early fight from the diamond backs they fade and then you're going back and forth with the Rockies or their battle tested we saw a year ago a lot of these guys have been through the postseason wars\nAnd you've got a lot of cases of the franchise let's just because it's Los Angeles that everybody gets a little bit of star time and you and you try to take care of the the players on your squad and get them their face time and recognition oh a lot of these guys have had their star turns\nAll along or were highly touted coming up so now it's just coming to fruition a few years ago it was the occasional hey here's Manny would\nOr whatever the case what happened and Clinton Herschel right it was one guy he was the face of everything mhm well now the team as a whole\nHas so many of those guys including Machado who almost tonight and you've got to figure out is he coming back or does he want to go to Philadelphia or New York or wherever you're going to end up but when you look at your rotation\nIt was more guys that you hope to get to the fifth of a sex\nAnd you looked at a lot of ... ... ... a lot of voting age just trying to enunciate hit us again do it in a ... that you're getting deeper into games and ... you played the hot and\nIt just from the euro metrics of it all what I'm taking motion out for a moment this is cold hard fact you gotta gotta pitches near the will one at home in his nine start\nYou don't want to go away from that you have to give him the opportunity to go out and\nThat they set the tone for the series and they did and then Clinton her shot comes in and now you've all been put the dagger ended the Braves he gives off ... lead up double George Clooney a junior and that's it one more hitting his eight innings of work\nJust a mashable or it's only three strike out and and you ... a young team that got there are a bit too soon and you've set things up and if Clinton her shot continues to pitch with that edge\nHow to how dangerous are you now and then you get you all are back in the next you've got three guys and whatever you got three guys and your rotation that you can trust to that level\nYou're almost unbelievable in today's based\nFox Sports radio the Jason Smith show with my car but how about a little bit of Dave Robert let's go feeling pretty good after the Dodgers held the Braves to a grand total of zero runs through the first two games\nCan I ask you about uh the deep with Clayton I'm a ... percent of them out and then making the change point it's just more forcing a Brian's hand um\nIf they would've brought do up there to face claim he was going to face some [noise] um but to for them to burn two players for one move [noise] um I felt that that was a way that you can get user to best hitters off the bench and get our guide and they're going to back\nDave how much consideration did you give to like Clinton finishing the game tonight [noise]\nI'm not really not a whole lot uh\n[noise] you know he took a bicycle in the fifth or sixth inning maybe ... off the hamstring [noise] and so as the game progress continue to tighten up a little bit [noise] and so for me um\nI thought obviously he had really good stuff but then as you get through the sixth seventh and eighth inning and understanding that the that uh the potential that it is tightening up [noise] um [noise] I felt we had a pretty good option and coming back there so I'm right there\nYeah again if we had the match up I was going to go with chemical or\nPlay for another hitter but as far as finishing the game um\nI didn't think too much about it to the front\nThey what do we make of eight innings eighty five pitches three strike out ... ... in your mind what we're looking at tonight in terms of who ... news and and what he may be becoming [noise]\nHe pitch he pitched [noise] um\nI think that it was it was one of for me or one of the best outings that I've seen that I can recall in the sense that um\nHe uses complete repertoire pitches [noise] um [noise] use both sides of the play to change I Love his affective leave [noise] and um he really pitched ... and so with that [noise] there was a lot of\nSoft contact [noise] ah he was in complete control\nIt was really a [noise] you know you've got\nSandy Koufax in the front row and you've got clay he was a he was an outstanding [noise]\nTraction there was this week how impressive was this even more impressive is able to put on a side [noise] um [noise]\nIs impressive though it's not a surprise um this guy is a potential hall of fame player uh so uh to to to have the noise around him but when it comes to his day to start and to help his ball club when the game\nI had no concern that anything was going to affect them\nAnd [noise] you know our decision I think there's a lot", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
