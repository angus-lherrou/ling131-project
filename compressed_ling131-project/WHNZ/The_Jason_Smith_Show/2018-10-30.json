twenty dollars in free agents say no that's absolutely incorrect because many Machado doesn't just won three hundred million dollars\nHe wants money from a specific team he has a preferred destination whether it's the Yankees\nWhether it's staying with a dog when I when I was you know it's not staying with the dogs because he wouldn't even say he wanted to stay and we've heard from many insiders on our show saying that you know man he's not the most beloved guy in that Dodger club he's a guy for him to move on\nYeah I've heard from a a couple that it's the he doesn't add you doesn't subtract yeah just kind of their\nRight and now you have this playoffs in which he put a lot of attention on himself for not hustling for dirty play\nAnd teams are seeing that this off season going\nAbout that now so let's just say the Yankees are his preferred destination right you didn't know what I mean it's fine someone's getting ready to travel throughout a million dollars if they're raised offer him three hundred million is he going there\nReally if the Indians offering three hundred million is he going there and I don't see anybody offering them three hundred million dollars maybe it's two hundred million but I don't see three hundred million he's costs himself money and he could have caused himself as destination because if I if I'm the Yankees and reading of the back page New York papers there like stay away stay away stay away\nHe wants let's say he wants to go there if I'm the Yankees I watch them in the world series and I go\nYeah he wants a lot of money I don't know that he's the guy we give that money is also the editor says ice Harper maybe Bryce Harper is the guy we say three hundred million let's go pay that for him so now suddenly you're saying okay I'm going to get paid but\nWould you want to go to is not there why would you do that and completely ruined your reputation the way many Machado dead and the thing is he did it all to himself\nIs nobody else did this to him he did this all to himself and again if he was great it wouldn't matter does it look at it really does this rate but he was awful and when they needed to hit he didn't hit and those two combinations are absolute killer so but you had a lot of this was\nWas scuttle butt in Baltimore but he was their guy right yet intimate Adam Jones and then\nBoth gone but you look at it now becomes a national story when you're on a contending team and you look at what was going on here in Los Angeles and every week when I Do my in Baltimore like out and loving them there's like as long as he's hitting no love anybody\nRight as long as he's performing and when they get up in these situations and being doing what they were brought him in to do what you did for for a good chunk of time before the this postseason\nThen yes you're below but then immediately you know it can turn on you on a dime and that's exactly what what happened ... years you've got all these red flag you talking about the Yankees as a preferred destination he's being hit the surface of the team that they built right now\nLike ... that gene that that the Yankees are built those are all guys they're also\nThey're young guys that are hungry mhm I mean go all the way down there and judge you know you could say what you want about the strike out level and whatever else\nHe's a guy that posted its tail in the field oh yeah and on the base pads and and it's taking none of his success and the headlines for granted and you're going to bring this guy\nWho came around not just that but who wants to forget about the Yankees at least you know they have a lot of players that are already good do you want to influencing younger play you know you want to bring him in and say hey you're going to be our leaders are usually the Braves saying yeah\nMany Machado come on it and you'd be the guy that rubs off on no that's not going to happen the Phillies come in and and that's nice no way that's good at\nEstablished clubhouse plug you hit thirty home runs will drive in Ninety runs and he's going to affect you and he's going to cause issues and you saw it here I mean I ever after every game good bad indifferent he was a lightning rod and that's that's not what you watch a long term for your locker\nTwitter out how about a fresco Mike at swollen DOMA Jason Smith show with my best friend my Carmen coming up more

of teachers are in preparation of this game\nYou know and celebrating the bears dominant went over the jets as well who are but then you know just kind of harkening back to the days when the bulls team was that curiosity that you know you had to figure out a way to get to the arena\nWhen they came to town and that was the the ... and the traffic snarl at everything with the warriors and and make sure as hell didn't disappoint if you sat down to watch that game\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox sweater at how about a fresco might swollen DOMA Jason Smith show with my car but I mean this is the actually this is this is the best team we've ever seen in the NBA you know modern day with everything else it's that good but speaking of something that good\nWe talked to Jay Glazer earlier in the show tonight he told us how insane the tray deadlines going to be in the NFL will get to the Sean McCoy and the possibility of him being traded Josh Gordon everybody we got Bill Belichick coming up soon but\nShe said you want to hear the craziest trade deadline story of all time said of course of course we do and he told us that back in two thousand eight Tony Gonzales\nWas traded to the Packers and the eagles\nThe chiefs wanted a third round picking a player\nAnd the eagles said yes and the Packers said yes and basically they told Tony Gonzales you have to figure out what team you want to go to right they ... we have a deal in place with both of these teams where do you want to go and after the deal was agreed upon ... Peterson the chief GM pulled it off the table and said no I Want a second round pick\nAnd Tony Gonzales was really mad after it was done because he thought I've gone to the ... picking between the Packers and the eagles and Carl Peters is that I Want a second round pick\nAnd nobody positive so we're not protecting a second round pick for Tony Gonzales\nSo we wind up staying with the chiefs he was really mad he left after the year went to the falcons and at five more phenomenal seasons in Atlanta another four hundred catches and thirty five touched Jay also told us the giants could have had Tony Gonzales but they didn't want to\nPart with the third round pick so jury reached the giants dropped out right away can you imagine the last ten years in the NFL what Aaron Rodgers would have done with Tony Gonzales those first four or five years when he started the league\nYou imagine like you mentioned with the eagles might have been able to do with Tony Gonzales 'cause it's not like he was done in Ninety catches a year for the next five years\nYeah that's that's certainly changed the complied should've of that if all history and and the NFC she will get those teams right L. J. Smith in Philadelphia\nI had a couple of moments but now it's just a guy talking about the best tight end that we've seen in NFL history and he had five more great years good the Packers of one three superbowls what Tony Gonzales an Aaron Rodgers back then good the eagles have won at least one you know what I Want to do\nI Want to go simulated out a video game [laughter] like I'm In when you're out and now they heard Jay said that on our show people are not as\nGreat story and I want to thank God I Love about our relationship with Jake laser he comes in and he drops gems like that\nWhen he said or he said do you want to hear a great you want to hear the best trade deadline story what are we going to say yeah I Know it's not you know now it's All right and that's that was in ... that would change the NFL in ten years would have ... different teams would win and lose the super bowl if that trait in one of those ...\n...

are um and uh I got really allowed to enlist after what happened was wrong [laughter]\nActually will hit carving find that ambulance\nWe're learning center is personal safety as Ted said read for

answer is no good\nAre\nMuch here reads question the answer one more time to four points that patients one out and what do you look like the leader\n[noise]\nWe probably don't want to be around my pushes run [noise] [laughter]\nOkay so the two theories are he really does it like you and threatened do the other theory you know\nBeing a very being the heavy player that he is and being the calculator play areas he's just sending a message a little bit of one to you to back off of the questions but also to his team that you know I'm not going to lose my patients now but keep trying me and then I could lose my patience because then you know coaches get fired and guys get traded\nWe were you ready for a little bit of a report rave I hesitate right here sure let's get\nOn men I think he meant exactly what he said I think he said exactly what he meant that I think he I asked them what does it look like what is the leader look like when things actually run out because he's been talking about Asians since the moment he signed with the Lakers either this is a young team is the first time you've\nEver been on a team where he is the oldest player on the team he's thirty three every single player that's rough are younger and most\nSome are Twenty one or twenty three uh as far as the core goes so he knew he was taking that's on when he came here he has been speaking patient since the beginning and frankly when you look at the Lakers\nThey're doing things that you expect young teens to do they're not fully following the defensive schemes are not fully following game plan they're not finishing games these aren't particularly surprising in fact\nI Would say we should be less surprise the Lakers are sitting at two and five right now and we should have been if they were sitting at five and two so I think what would on really meant\nWas pretty simple he just had a man when when I get mad you'll know that I get mad and I think he is that I think he's right now I think he's frustrated I don't think he's mad and I think when he's mad when we all know it\nWell but he gets it out there ... just the we we've seen him clean house before as a factor GM in Cleveland so perhaps a bit earlier to put people on notice but certainly not unprecedented\nNot unprecedented I mean here's the thing with a bronze it's like a it's like every president\nIn American history and until Donald Trump is like broken all the rules here but it's like you read into every little thing a ... and you read the tea leaves and everything went wrong says is the headlines are that's why he tries to not say that much\nAnd maybe tonight he said a little bit too much just describing what he's like I\nI thought to be honest I think what brown is in a I don't think he is frustrated with this team I think he knew this was going to happen I think he's doing fine with the Lakers but this was not going to get ... in right away but they won they need more development of their youngsters to\nThey need another another big piece in order to get over that hump so to\nMe I think we're barter fairly sanguine about this he knows the warriors are the best in the west he knows that the Lakers probably not going to be in the top or in the west but he also knows that\nHe is one of the best to basketball players of all time and he could put this team on the shoulders when he needs to and there's a lot of potential here which we see in in clashes in spurts we don't yet on a consistent basis because they're so young but I work I think this is I Know what you expect [laughter]\nRead frost burgers already told me he's not buying it he thinks that was a direct threat to you for asking about losing [laughter]\nHold on hold on the Emirates drivers loading me into the ambulance\nRight now I'm going to be like five seconds until I'm a well let me get this one of the oxygen mask on okay\nDid you feel for a second it was directed it you\nKnow what's funny is a after he says you don't want to see me when I'm uh when I lose my patients first of all I thought if his poor children like I'm like oh my God when he loses his patience with the children I watch out for federal then I then I kind of laughed a\nAnd also you can hear that in the tape but I laughed and LeBron stare at me like stairs like basically through me and he's like I'm Serious [laughter] than my uh ... that might you know was just kind of shriveled deep inside me and said oh Ron whatever you say sir\nYou seriously [laughter] don't you laugh at it went on his right hand [laughter] your head cars in your head
