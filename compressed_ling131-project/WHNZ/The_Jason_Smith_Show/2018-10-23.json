you know and so\nThis and read was one of the first ... but what got me is how the world is read tell in Jenkins that Jenkins as a sellout\nBecause Jenkins worked with the NFL to get money spent

in touch with some of those and says well\nThe latest with the situation is concerned Saudi Arabia and the ongoing with this and then of course\nThe president and the agreement that nuclear agreement on this treaty is that going to withdraw he says that the that uh and apparently secretary of defense James Mattis is completely aligned with Trump on\nPulling out of that nuclear treaty with Russia a so I mean whatever Madison is okay with I think I'm OK with uh the INS they say that Russia has already violated it on this and then the caravan and all that stuff Steven ... with the D.C international\nAdvisory he has a foreign policy expert having previously advised a former VP Dick Cheney on foreign policy Steven always a pleasure to have you thanks for joining us\nHappy to be with you\nSo I Want to start first off I'm going to start with the Russian treaty that the Mattis is on board with the president pulling out of this they the claim is that Russia's already violated this is this going to spark an arms race though\nWell whatever arms race there's going to be is already under way there's two major world\nThe United states is not alone in saying that Russia has violated disagreements or the United kingdom or other allies are completely on board and noting that you're really a question of what you can do about it and the other major flaw that others agree with you know about is that it doesn't capture China\nAnd China is the most rapidly growing nuclear arsenal on the planet and so the foreign policy at Nineteen eighty seven doesn't necessarily cover the needs of twenty eight team\nAnd the Trump Administration has made a habit of calling out ineffectual agreements threatening to withdraw from the middle of the times it can provoke constructed debate about how to get into a better agreement but I strongly sunsets where this is\nRight and at this issue why do it now as opposed to I mean obviously this has been going on to with a violation of buying up by Russia for quite some time ah why why at this particular point would he would he choose to to withdraw now\nWell from my point of view is never a bad day to do a good thing so it's what we needed to do it it's a good time to start it may have something to do with shouldn't basket or John Bolton being national security advisor it'll be ... yeah the router more experienced arms control and accountability racial expert\nAs national security advisor and so we've got someone who is uniquely experience to go in and gauge this challenge I think part of it is that there's a lot of intelligence coming in\nA in and out of government that suggested China's really breaking for the ...\nI think that's what finally ... the arguments on this is not just the U.S Russia issue it's a global nuclear capabilities issue and from that at this point of view there's no reason limiting ourselves if the other party is violating it and a third party that's not in the group is running it\nMhm is there a chance that because the president is you know obviously would like to include China and some sort of agreement is that what would they even be would they even do that is that something that he would even be able to get them to do\nWell he's been able to do things that most experts didn't think could be done already so I Can't say it's impossible because of new NAFTA was impossible in your yard and so but I think that there's no reason to believe the Chinese will want to do that and I don't think that the Russian surely walked\nTo renegotiate because they had a good deal that did what they wanted which was to annoy the United states to limit its ability to deal with China\nAnd basically we get all of\nThe followers of arms control theology to get into high church about how important it is for the United states to disarm cells in order to keep the world stage\nAnd then um I I Want to switch from from this to Saudi Arabia and of course the region where in Russia does play a huge role this ongoing\nDiscussion and investigation of the the death of democracy yoga and I was talking to them a couple of people about this including last week we were stuck with ... who it was it was fascinating to see\nA NSMBC and other networks tried to spin\nQuestioning why Saudi Arabia would target Jamal ... as as conservatives ... engaging in some sort of whisper smear

liked\nThat on purpose [noise] it's so difficult folks have a wonderful life we rejoin you tomorrow on Tuesday\nDot com fifty when\nAre free I downloaded [noise]\nProposition because at some like Ninety four you're looking at a forty eight point nine or something like that percentage of two point conversion so if you missed the first one you're still worst scenario if you do your job defensively\nWas always a key 'cause you're still going to have to play because they don't on side kicking scenarios as well which is leaving me confused yeah where do they have not going to ... and quarterback sneaks when you've got no time to time management clock management sure she'll be getting murdered for those not necessarily for this particular call 'cause\nI don't know ... years right in here I'm going to do math on I Love all the maps were doing your your your don't do math um the interest and is that what's the what's it easier to do you have a fifty percent let's let's put it right a fifty percent to get a to point conversion right\nSo that means you're going to get one and you're gonna miss one you don't want to do that sure so if you get one and you miss one then that's still going to be fourteen point that's fine but here's the\nThing Jason is then we're still tied right if I get my fifty percent\nRight then you're taught by net I've got another coin flip for overtime which is another ... what I don't want to happen I don't\nYeah but you still with the new rule changes it's not as big a deal is okay we're we're gonna we're going to give the ball up a team's going to go but it's made the mistake well I mean obviously\nIt's a new world order with the ten minute clock and we've got a few ties to show for it but you're you're still adding the extra variable of an overtime where you can still news\nOr you could win I mean if I didn't let it's another ... even if the coin flip at this point statistically it's not it's if you wanted to do the two point conversion\nIs it easier to convert a fifty percent play twice or is it easy to convert an eighty five percent play twice because that's about what ... what extra points on again anybody\nGet we're going to the ... of MIT playing for the extra ten minutes\nOr do I want to win and when you're when you're playing right so now you're going to win if you go for ... counts going to overtime I'm Sorry that you're down to two touchdowns but now if you're a scoring two touchdowns late you're has the momentum going in you moved up and down the field\nYou're trying to win to put all of it on a fifty fifty plan that's really that's not what I did hear and that's what my ... he put it on a fifty fifty play to win or lose the gator I Need I Need a better percentage of that if I'm going to put it on that plane if\nGetting a to point conversion what say Seventy five or eighty percent yeah I'm with you okay that's the math I can say look three to four times you're going to get it All right fine but fifty percent it it's it's not worth it but it\nBut that's that's a different scenario right now you're playing it to overtime but you're going fifty fifty or don't fifty fifty or between converting the two point conversion at the end of the game like the titans tried and then whether you can win or not and over time we're sure where did it and that still makes sense\nI let's listen to ... try to explain the math and going for two here he is a couple of minutes ago explaining it to the media\nFrom an offensive perspective it got to score touched on as we get down there and again we did a good job of moving the ball we've got a score touchdowns and\nI'm sure you have some questions about the a to point play I I just felt like and you know we've discussed you know internally the math on that I just felt like I felt like we had a good play and I I like to point place elections and we just didn't quite get it done but\nAt the end there you saw had they not kicked a field goal I felt good about our second two point\nFive which we scored on a dance so [noise] um [noise] you know I felt like I wanted to be aggressive four guys or you know I saw I saw where one Ford on 'em for them you know we're struggling to move the ball we're that close again we felt like we had to play [noise]\nYou know I think initially I thought oh deli popped open for my view I the coverage is probably a little tighter than what I've seen 'em and so uh so Eli extended the play a little bit\nYou know you saw he had run on one of the negatives earlier in the dry maybe thinking you could run and then um and I was little tighter coverage on the rest of the guys so we didn't get it done [noise] um [noise]\nAgain [noise] shouldn't be any questions about how hard our guys fight we just got it actually came into play well in place and I'm\nSo those are things that we can point to as we move forward we aren't doing the ... we're getting ready to play Washington Redskins here in about six days standing in the back immigration status by fifty percent if you go for it and make it there [noise]\nSo that's that's what you do because then if we scored a touchdown would just kick the extra point when I felt good about the two point play you guys saw that I think we got the ball in Iraq and we just didn't connect on [noise]\nI went five right here so I'm like how he just says I like you said you're crazy by fifty percent if you get it ... the the word in there that's the operative is if it's not like it's a fate accompli or it's a great chance it's a fifty fifty play and that's an unnecessary risk\nYou know if it was like I said if it was higher I could see it but it said what if what if they're okay\nIt's it's this is outsmarting yourself and thinking okay this math I'm going to try to embrace it and see if it really works but as you can see that's not the case and I understand everything you're going to tell me about this and I understand every bit of math\nBut now he says well if we got it we just need to get that one at the end and then as you saw we got it All right let's go back you didn't get the first one so now you to fifty fifty play just to tie the game if you get that touchdown you're talking about going down feel getting a touchdown and men having another two point play that you're going to run\nSo now suddenly instead of an extra point to make the twenty to Thirteen\nYou need a to point conversion justify it just to get the overtime which is the coin flip you say it is\nSo that's still is it worth it to me because it is a toss up play\nAnd that's what that's what nobody wants to continue on to go well if it's fifty five or forty seven or forty eight or fifty sometimes at six ... that's not good enough that that that's the I I don't want a chance like that\nIf I Need to find something to succeed right do I want a Ninety percent chance of something or do I want a fifty fifty three percent chance of something I ... percent ya I'd rather do something Ninety percent twice\nThan fifty percent one out of two or two out of two\nThat that's just just how I look at things and I understand\nYou know when people talk about the math says yeah in a vacuum it does but there are so many other things that you have to realize could derail that play and there's more things to derail a to point conversion then there are to derail an extra point well\nObviously this is now another a part of the statistical sample that'll take it to less than fifty percent\nYou could sell Jason\nAll of this one now it's under fifty ... you'll you'll feel slightly better about your your your Mike Mike under coaches who are really smart they would do a Bill Belichick would do it all the time right now by if certainly if there was a better chance for them to when he would do it every single time we're going to hear why well matter you know he would do it other really\nMike Tomlin would do it many of my time on already does almost always [laughter] I'm All right well they were going to rent it where they may go they go through a lot of that but that but that was just saying we're going to do with every single time not when the ...\nThis was the last big trade of the former Dodgers front office now Andrew Freeman comes in and things are run differently\nWith the Dodgers ever make a trade like this again of course not but because this trade one so bad the Dodgers D to well we have to change our philosophy and how we do things so now that more money ball came in a bit of a different attitude a different way of doing business and one of the Dodgers done they've built a team that is very deep\nThey uh four guys on the bench every night that could start for almost any other team in the major leagues they're pretty good bullpen\nAnd they've they've able to develop a couple of young starting pitchers so they've not relied on ... and now where are they\nBack to back World Series so had they not gone through this really bad time of boy the bloated contracts and the and the and and the guy's making twenty million years not working out for us they would not have changed course and then they don't change course there are still sitting somewhere trying to compete in the west and\nThey're just a team like the Mets were going to sign a bunch of guys give them some money for a couple of years and see if they can hit home runs\nThat's not how this team is built and now you can take it a step further and say All right the team is built this way\nDo you think they're going to give many Machado three hundred million and the off season you think they're going to extend Clinton Kurdish offer seven more years of two hundred and fifty million you think they're going to go give Bryce Harper three hundred million that's not what this Dodgers front office does so not only are they built the\nWorld Series caliber team two years in a row but they've also given you a window into okay maybe we're not down for these guys were seven eight years like Bryce Harper is going to want like what ... going to want if the ... and like what many channels going to want so there's that there's the the current part for the Dodgers and the future aspect as well and that's the biggest\nPart of any of these organizations you strip it down to the studs you go back to what the cubs did it change that their whole scouting team changed out a lot of the front office went to the analytics and all of a sudden what did you have a total growth of homegrown players that became major contributors\nAcross the board ship good draft strategy and then throughout their minor leagues they they ... up and changed out a number of managers and coaching\nAt each level to try to do the Dodgers same thing right where you you have a you still have money to guys I mean you you have a you're printing cash or when it comes down to it and you have the brings truck at your disposal given ownership and what you want to do what\nYou needed those home drunk guys and now you get to have the the ... decision making process of Machado of a harbor you can do it\nYou want to do it for eight years were you looking at hey we'll we'll give you a little extra juice but let's let's agree on three or four years we don't want to be locked in especially 'cause some of these younger that you're gonna have to pay them\nBut that's a decision that the Dodgers have to make and that the Yankees have to make a going forward is that you've got a lot of his own drone Taliban hasn't gotten their their big novelty check yet\nSo they're all lining up soon enough so we'll see what the next generation of is but certainly going back to that trade you saw the organizational philosophies differ and now here we are ready for and what should be a fun fall classic\nTurn around and how about a ... Mike at swollen don't the Jason Smith show is from ... friend\nMy garment Tonight Show brought to you by discover card we treat you like you'd treat you coming up on a minute\nWe'll give you our official picks for the world series was the biggest X factors are but right now speaking of X factors there's a couple of big ones going on right now in LA the Lakers and liberal on a big nip tuck battle with the spurs Deb Carson has that and more with what's trending that ain't right\nIn fact the Lakers had a and they just tied the game it's one of five apiece now for the Lakers and the spurs\nOf course Brennan anger and rage genre on a suspended tonight so Cal ... my ... he leaves the Lakers with twenty eight points LeBron James just Seventeen\nOn six at fourteen shooting and again right now as I look at it it's one of five apiece for San Antonio and the Lakers eight fifty six to go in the fourth quarter warriors are the ones well then you find home lead over the sun's fourth quarter early overtime in Portland\nWizards lead the trailblazers one fourteen one Thirteen we now know the starting rotation at least for the first three games for LA in the world series Cleveland curse shallow the on the hill for game one\nTuesday at Fenway aid eastern first\nPitch I really want to win the world series I think that's no different than the other fifty guys and before her um so I think it doesn't [noise] I think the only difference maybe as a because we've gotten so close in the past because we've gotten to go to the post season are a little bit spoiled and our expectations every year with the Dodgers which is a great thing that\n... starting for the Dodgers Chris Sale on the hill from Boston game to ... versus David Price and we now know Walker Mueller will be on the hill friday back in LA for game three\nNo starter named ingest yet for Boston online car shopping can be confusing not any more of a true price from drew car now you know the exact price to pay for your next car visit to car to enjoy and more confident\nCar buying experience and Monday Night football finally falcons\nEdging the giants twenty three twenty Atlanta improving to three and four giant and dismal one in six to start the season well this will unless you're ... you're a happy one [laughter] yeah yes are you going to get from quarterback\nThis time I Know another running back because that's how we are ill I got a couple more years and I don't sign I'm doing it 'cause that's where a lot from the guy goes studios were\nFifteen minutes can save you Fifteen Percent or more in car insurance more info visit Geico dot com\nHey Jason there was a a big moment in this Lakers spurs game right before the fourth quarter they bring the fan up and a half court shot drained it for thirty grand wow then tried to head over to the Lakers bench security stop them from getting any closer\nTo really try to get to the ... wanted to go get high fives security just them on our way past the other way might oh hey I I'm ready to go look at first shooter ready to go ready to go see the I'm going to turn out to be the best head\nCoach the Lakers possibly could have after what could turn out tonight your Lakers and the spurs no absolutely one hundred percent my idea of what I said good happened is actually happening at this moment for the Lakers\nSeems like you should go out and buy some lottery pick up the uprising it looked\nReally quick I told you the brawl on Saturday that saw this was actually the brand name drugs and rage on Rondo may not be the worst thing for the Lakers because number one sometimes brawls like that bring teams together number two\nThe Lakers may need the shot making of ... more than they need the athleticism of Brandon Ingram this is because the team is built about around LeBron James and he knows what he needs to succeed doesn't mean Brennan Ingram is less talented than ... ... what it means they'll this may be what the Lakers all fence needs\nAnd so far tonight what's going on with the spurs and the Lakers won ten one oh nine\n... coups has thirty he is twelve for Twenty one from the floor the Lakers were down by Eighteen and the first quarter they battled back to take the lead LeBron James closing in on a triple double a twenty points\nNine assists and seven ... so\nUh I'll be replacing Luke Walton has Lakers head coach and I probably will serve the next game give it a couple of more games they LeBron might decide to do that anyway [laughter]\nBut we'll give you more on this again there is still six and a half minutes to go in the game Lakers and the spurs versus at a big three ball so now they're up one Fifteen to one ten days but with the world series coming up tomorrow DVR official picks for the fall classic and\nOne of the big X factors as what's going to lead me to my pick for the red Sox bullpen is a very big X factor because\nThis was a bad bullpen and they could regress to the mean in the world series they have been the second best bullpen behind the Dodgers overall the playoffs and I think that's no coincidence the two teams that are playing for the world's\nBought you started who's buying your daily fantasy leagues have you\nKnow not that I said he was going to have a big night but I kind of said he might have a big no you you hope you you didn't say I kinda do you know you kind of said\nWhat do I mean good I said you know listen I could coach the Lakers will get into that after the game is over right now again how does this way it's still going one Eighteen oh no the fan\nAnd we'd whatsoever every game is like one thirty five one twenty five now I Would start a fight [laughter] just as long as the game down leaders like no no no it's like they used to play is already\nWay too slow slow down a lot of points generated a lot of time out a lot of free throws\nA but again a Lakers down by three with just under three minutes left apply earlier today well more on the Monday Night game between the giants and the falcons one by the falcons coming up in ten minutes the raiders finally found a taker for Mari Cooper\nThe Dallas Cowboys and the words of GM Reggie McKenzie I got a phone call this morning from Stephen Jones\nYou had to pick we want we had the player he wanted so we did the deal so a guy who's been a jag wide receiver for two years Omari Cooper gets turned into a first round pick the cowboys give up for him so the raiders congratulations you've fleece the cowboys I don't know how\nBut I I ... you give away ... but then you get a first round pick for a guy who was a Jack and is going to be a free agent in a year so the big day for the raiders I give them a lot of credit 'cause they they got a made a good deal\nCould I can I throw in a quick thing here though I've seen on Twitter and Facebook and all sorts of media all day people trying to draw the comparison to what the\nPatriots gave up Josh Gordon summary Cooper you may not white his output you may look at the disparity between how many fewer than thirty games there three thirty receiving your games he has versus a hundred yard games it's about a three to one ratio on the\nOutside he hasn't been suspended for the Here's Senator I okay that's a while you may like yours Gordon Helen immensely one slip up but he never sees the field again\nThis is the thing about the Dallas Cowboys\nIs that well obviously should they get a first round pick no this is the Jerry Jones special\nI this is like if I went to the clearest been at a supermarket I pick something out I'm not going to the register saying no I Want to pay double you don't pay you give up a first round pick\nFor I'm Ari Cooper he's just not good enough but the cowboys did it a bigger thing is why because the cowboys have been so mismanaged the last couple of years this is all they have\nIs to be able to go bargain basement hunting\nThey got themselves in such salary cap hell they have to take chances in every NFL Draft why did it take guys like ... somebody with a character concerns or someone who's with an injury history but\nHas first round talent because they can't pay for anybody else they have no choice but to make these ... they have no choice but to make a trade for a more Cooper 'cause there's nowhere else they can get guys like this so this is how they've been mismanaged back to being the Dallas Cowboys they were like twelve years ago\nAnd this is not going to be something that is going to be look back and say boy here's a turning point for the Dallas Cowboys I'm already Cooper is just the guy he's been just a guy if you need them I get it but to give up a first round pick\nThat's just ludicrous especially a guy who in the year is walking away when the cowboys conceivably could continue to suck and suddenly that first round pick looks really good for the raiders\nOr the cowboys completely mismanaged everything and it's not just this trade it's because of everything else that came up to this rate is why they had to make this ...\nWhat's the danger of thinking you're better than you are right you you make this move because you're three and four and you say you know what in the east we've\nGot a shot is this guy is making that much better [laughter] that's that's the big question if\nYou if you're going all in and he's the different maker to make you a potentially a wildcard team perhaps go and steal the division while silly still tries to figure itself out\nAnd you still have Washington that we don't know how much we liked them so I guess that's what your point workers Cooper is only got one more year at his deal mhm like that's the big part of it is that there is no longevity year and the price\nFor wide receivers is going to ask an article that the guy you

[noise] download it now [noise]\nIt when the damn thing so it doesn't matter if you spend money poorly and other positions which they have the sense of line is still a turnstile oftentimes\nThey haven't shows like one Barclay out to pick up a blitz yet so there is you are manning getting back into by his running back and the opposing Russia so you got all these other component parts of your roster where you you really made some\nTactical errors in terms of how you build things\nYou like manning wasn't great made three Ninety nine that it's going to be eye popping in the box score he missed some throws miss some opportunities but you know there's there's so many things wrong with the giants right now that the it it's really easy to just throw it out of dark born it something\nAbout that but that's but that's the point is it's not about older because then if you want to you could throw the off the field stuff on a go boy now is he really worth it but I mean but let's not even that part of it this is just\nThe importance of a wide receiver and being smart in spending money because you have so much to fix on this team but here's old held back um junior that now you have committed a ton of that money to\nThat you need to be able to attract free agents you to be able to have enough money to continue to build the team did you have so many holes in his roster your entire offensive line your defense everywhere but you've committed all this money to back him junior there's only so much I Know the salary cap goes up and up every year but you can and a lot of money to him\nAnd now you're no closer to fixing the problems is raw stress then you were when you gave it to him the giants are an absolute dumpster fire I mean they're they're a dumpster fire and\nHas Jay Glazer said hey listen you they're going to need two or three years to get out from under there at right now so now if I ask you was giving back and junior that kinda money the best thing they could do or should they a franchise in franchise and again\nAnd we're going to I'm going to pay you know I'm always going to guys are in charge or franchisee off I'll get great production out of you you got to stay healthy and it's awesome but they decided no we want to pay a lot to keep your long term he's a wide receiver\nA franchise anybody that's non quarterback you just had the price of the quarterback is escalating far faster than the other position so if I've got a quarterback that I Believe in and I want around fulltime and the guy I invest my money and but as we've seen the giants the big contracts or other guys to try to\nFill holes and even coming off last year there were so many injuries off that team I think to some degree it was believing that getting them healthy was going to be enough to be competitive again and then this NFC West that's been\nMediocre red badge drag your leader and the clubhouse is Washington at foreign to but how good are they\nRight stole a lot of enemy you got to win over the cowboys a little bit of controversy everybody up in arms and the cowboys immediately going make a trait but we can look at the the giants and I think\nTo some degree there was the belief that you had enough around and coupled with a couple of pieces little spat on it that you could put you lie manning behind that team and get it rolling\nFox Sports radio that Jason Smith show with my ...\nFriend my carbonate seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Twitter at how about a fresco Mike had swollen dome I mean that that's the the reality with the New York giants which is why paying money for a wide receiver it's just it's not worth it\nIt's not it's not going to help you is not going to take you to the promised land no one build their team around wide receivers wide receivers are positions that need to be liquid that you need to build debts\nAnd you build around a quarterback that can make the right calls that's how you should build this team\nAnd the giants have failed to realize how to build this team ... what they should have done is in star instead of giving money to back them and drafting sake one Barclay what do we do what's the fastest way to building a good team let's go out and get a good offensive line let's make the right off the blind decisions\nUnless draft a quarterback but instead they didn't do that so let's go top heavy with a couple of big names\nAnd they're no closer to being good than they were before the ... on the plus side\nYou're going to get a quarterback on a nice rookie deal going forward\n[noise] this is

small sample size\nBut I catch and shoot wasn't atrocious\nActually knock down a couple of shots because you know the defense is collapsing on the broad loves is going to have a lot open looks last year it was open looks before he got hurt because he couldn't shoot and people were cheering him to shoot\nIf he's added any element of an outside shot becomes that much more dangerous 'cause you

Billy did it oh so Billy oh that that it's fine that\nJust because Doug Peterson did it doesn't mean it's a rite application and football yes the math works that you should be able to convert however there is more at stake than just math\nThere was more at stake than just well anywhere from fifty to sixty percent of the time it works with a however the variable goes for this\nThat's not good enough because there's too many variables if you want to keep going math than just the masses you should do this the giants are a bad football team right that does that take into account how many bad football teams to point conversion there's enough work for that\nNo the mess just works overall but you got to say hey how many teams that are are not talented what what's their record for two point conversion\nBut that's where the bath comes into play here okay it's in that and that you're eliminating one of the variables if this works in your do your favor and ... or do back in June we're actually catches the ball but because now you got your two and assuming you the best that\nThere's a lot of there's a lot of variables that way and there's too many variables that here's one year knock it off\nThe back end because if you're on the road and you're a bad team and everything that ... can go wrong has all year what's up play for overtime which is essentially what Schumer and companies are doing here right because you get the two point conversion here\nYou've closed it to six and if you're able to get a stop to get the ball back scored a touchdown now you kick a PHD and you win the game\nAnd you're going to over you know I'm not playing for over a plane for overtime is kicked the extra points scored a touchdown and go for two to try to win the game no that would that's when do that with the willing\nFor overtime you're you're ... you're playing to win because if you you're going to need to score a second touched unless you can somehow manages a clock may look we see a lot of coaches mismanaged the clock but there was no way you were getting that extra possession in there that people get our guy could have gone to to feel goes\nI Know that there's a turnover you're not getting enough but the idea being that if you if your score the two\nAnd you're down just six touchdown plus the eighty you're done you're not leaving it to the fifty fifty proposition that is over time which is probably skewed when you were at one in five team\nOn the road there's at those scales back and it's probably a lesser than fifty percent chance of going in and winning in overtime so you're trying to eliminate that and take that off the board\nI get I get the math I get to understand what I that's of course we're talking about it you don't like it but I Know if you're trying to convert\nIt's a fifty fifty it's a little bit over fifty percent chance you get a to point of that is not high enough that's not high enough for me when your goal is to try to win the game if you go for two trying to go for two twice it's one over two times won over to that's one quarter\nThat's twenty five percent you know that's right that's inaccurate was their their their\nIndependence place to live side of the very first one over two and one over no\nBut it right but it's half perhaps that's not one half times have because they're not related to independent please write it", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "23"}
