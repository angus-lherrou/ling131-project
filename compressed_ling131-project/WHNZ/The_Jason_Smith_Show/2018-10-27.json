come on just so happened to be in the world see well let's\nWhite folks that when you get down and Roger Maris and they start breaking down his career as well I get it it it's the way it works in Yankee lower but certainly for Walker Mueller\nEverybody's got their eyebrows raised because we know what's coming right we've been talking about Clinton courage shots contract we've been talking about the opt out and you're wondering what the life would be now obviously you always loved to have the left hander sit there at the front end of things you look at Walker viewer I think I'm okay with that\n[laughter] the other thing really quick forget to Katie is intends lawyer\nWho had one of the worst innings of a non pitcher you want to see in baseball uh got thrown out twice yeah running the bases and then did get thrown out trying to score from third of the sacrifice fly that ended the eleven singing that song Cody Ballenger from\nNot deep probably probably mid range in center field right sacrifice fly he throws Ken's around at the plate and kids are is getting a lot of hate a lot of Kansas yeah he had a bad thing but you know what he actually wound up getting the third base on a base it and\nHe had to try to score I mean as bad as it was running the bases and it and it's like you can for looked like he was watching Mets videotapes to try to get some inspiration\nThe thing is is that he had to try to score they're yeah they're seen as your warning unity the Tour de France third one out now there's two outs\nYou have to try to score because it wasn't so shallow that All right this is just a fool's errand but you had to make balance or make a good throw grand all had to catch the ball which you know ground has been really good at that the last few games so you had to make the Dodgers make a play\nAnd I'm fine with that because if they don't make that throw villages throws off line it's gifts\nThat's run over had to do that\nAnd he's the way Ballenger caught the ball drifting you know and and it's not quite the quarterback throwing against his body but certainly as he's coming in momentum coming forward towards the the left field line and\nThrows up the up the line grab all has to go make a play on it and then he's got a hold on to the ball after the collision that wasn't nearly as intense a collision as one might have seen five to ten years ago but either way and in cans or in going towards the base does it actually touch the base either so that was the the end of his\nIs happening of folly on the base paths although I think we would have said he'd gone over the pile on yeah he would have gotten pile on here or there you go but doesn't get a John Ballenger who'd been picked off\nAt the bottom half of the prior anything I mean it was a huge huge redemption moment for him because people have been calling for him and and here you go on and he's able to wipe out the base runners so just an amazing run and now\nOh my goodness Dodgers defense the red Sox have just pushed across the go ahead and run in the top of the thirteenth inning and this was just insane it's been a rough last couple of minutes for ... yeah he's\nBeen knocked down a couple of times while you get up again are ... ah\n... no ... we are tub something\nSo hope walks to lead off the top of the thirteenth ending for the red Sox and\nHe still second on the steel of second the ball gets away from ...\nMunoz is up and as ... goes to get the ball he kinda runs into pneumonia yeah ... yeah and lands on his back so hope steal second known Yaz gets up has to walk around with ... make sure he's okay he is okay to get back in and that\nSo now here he is runner at second nobody out and ... he has just hits a ground or to the right of the pitcher's mound Alexander goes to retrieve it but\nHe has to try to beat the play to first base which is almost impossible\nAnd in the end tries to toss the ball\n... Hernandez who was covering because you watch ... months to come in to try to catch that ball as well it was a slow ground her hip between the pitcher's mound at first base months he comes into get it Alexander gets adjust to hit in the perfect spot\nAnd Alexander has to now trying to make his way to the base\nAnd we watched\nHer name does try to get there as fast as he could he couldn't the flip goes over his glove\nHold scores from third baseman scammers in noon Yaz is down because he gets tumbled over by Hernandez as he's trying to make the play right and now the red Sox have a two to one lead nobody out the top of the thirteenth inning after that\nConflicts of circumstances the past few minutes and already you're thinking here's Dave Roberts is going to get criticized city of walk the runner to to force up a play at first base all of these things are going to be on the table but this is where we sit right now\nTop of the thirteenth ending Dodgers\nTrail the red Sox two to one and so far in the theme of really what the World Series has been the red Sox have just had the brakes they've made a little bit more of a fifty fifty plays and that's why they said with a to one lead top of the thirteenth ... now the wide\nShot there as they closed it on Jackie Bradley genius showed a little bit of the advertising at Dodger Stadium a and it included forest lawn cemetery that's not good right All right scores year and a Thirteen\nTwitter out how about a ...

again now can say ask Walter we've got a million dollar a cat\n[laughter] you know it's like the cat walking across the uh although the buttons at the end of inside out\nOh okay yeah yeah ah so this is or not but the other big story of than a Kevin Durant comes to Madison Square garden and leaves a future New York neck\nWith Kevin Durant potential free agency looming over everything in the NBA this year there's been a lot of talk the last few months that Kevin Iran's gonna wind up signing with the Knicks when he's a free agent after this year we've gone over just why many times\nHas played the next tonight and in this game\nKevin Durant scored twenty five in the fourth quarter the mix up three and they lost twenty twenty eight and ... had to play this game in the shadow of big billboard that was up outside Madison Square garden trying to lure Kevin Durant to New York and it was a Big Love fest Kevin Durant try out game I mean that's\nReally what it was signed autographs for a long ride it out I I mean there were every video you could possibly have been interacting with a bad it was like they were shooting a marketing videos\nRight someone who's in the crowd or you can go to that section you go to that section you go down with the kids are getting autographs all of this we're going to have this going to be part of our pitch to him when the season it and make sure you're really loud do you think before they get up and did their warm ups alright and expands our guys in town we really need to sell as well\nBe nice to have him be nice to him okay everybody don't throw stuff on the floor don't spend it anybody don't yell at me bad chance be nicer than\nEverybody was nice to Kevin Durant and then one minute you're going to hear how nice she was back and Mrs more evidence that he's going to wind up being an act but first let's check in with what's happening with the cars in DC\nWhat do you have guys Dodgers get out of the bases loaded jammed as they had to the bottom of the thirteenth they have work to do they now trailing by our on top of the frame Brock whole scored on a throwing Arab by a pitcher Scott Alexander ... leave the Dodgers to one and they are in the bottom of the thirteenth ending at Chavez Ravine\nAnd the Dodgers already trail the series Boston have two games to none\nCollege football action at the rose bowl twenty thirty and Utah the thirty four Twenty one lead ever UCLA for to go on the game Wyoming leads at Colorado State forty one to ten six to go in the fourth quarter\nOn my car shopping can be confusing not any more of a true friends from Jew car now you can have the exact price you pay for your next carve isn't true car to enjoy it more confidence car buying experience raptors that confidence six an hour now they beat the mavericks won sixteen when I was seven\nAnd five and a record now for the bucks to start the season they won at Minnesota one twenty five at Ninety five pelicans still undefeated as well as for an hour after meetings and that's one Seventeen one Fifteen\nAnd the warrior scored forty seven and the fourth quarter to beat the next one twenty eight one hundred and Kevin Turan forty one for Golden State and of course are fun thanks for the night to mark his cousins who still hasn't played a minute for the warriors and the regular season 'cause he's recovering from that Achilles injury\nGot into an argument in history close\nA with referee Scott Foster assessed the technical foul and then he jak in from the bench area so before he even makes the teen debut this injection goes down as his first ever sat as a member of the Golden State warriors\nThere we go getting thrown out of a game I wasn't even it was pretty good [laughter] but I feel like the British and of course we're allies and the guy goes studios were Fifteen minutes because they'd be Fifteen Percent or more car insurance go to guy go dot com right now and see how much you can save well before we get to Kevin Durant\nDodgers have the lead off runner on on a full count pitch max Muncie checks to swing\nThe appeal down to third was no swing so if you're on a third\nOf us are is on first nobody out and many Machado up for the Dodgers on replay Alex core looked like he was really upset but the replay it looked like it was close but he held up that you didn't break the risk that didn't go far out over the plate what I've seen looks like that was a good call\nI like the way you're doing it demonstrative Lee here in the guy knows ... I'm into it arms going through your rivers golf swing going on here now Machado with the opportunity to come up big here are you still being a eviscerated offered out running the ball\nOut earlier you hit one to the wall on ended up just being a very very long single or so he's one of the bullet points on this evening for the Dodgers in terms of where this played out one for five on the night\nYeah many Machado look he earlier in the game he hits a fly ball down the line and he Cadillacs at all the way to first base so we get to add on that when you got they got that first case exactly he thought it was going out instead what happened\nIt went off the wall and instead of a double he wound up with a single Cody Ballenger did pop up to end the ending but it's a different\nThing is that choice and right in front of him as you know they're worried about stealing science Manny Machado at second base there was a big story this afternoon as many Machado stealing signed a second base it could be a different pitch in that situation\nEarlier in the game for the poor cello\nAnd instead many Machado looks like he's determined to ruin his value in free agency by continuing to not hustle now maybe he's seen fourteen million combinations of him trying to get three hundred million dollars\nAnd this was the only one that's worked on going and not hustle during the off season and that's what I'm getting my three hundred million now he was wearing a tape that would have taken it and that's what\nI feel like watching him the last few innings it's every swing is I'm swinging for the fences sure I feel like every year you got a runner at first no buddy out hey we can be here and I feel like he's I mean every every swing I feel like it's either going to be a home run\nOr miss I mean that that's really where he's at right now it's all or nothing with a home run major league baseball twenty Eighteen the outcome\nWill keep you updated on this right now many Machado again batting is Nathan evolving nobody out runner at first base gospel again let regularly let's hear from Kevin Durant your guy Kevin Durant who is going to wind up being in bed for many reasons as well as I've said it's not\nSoon Cady he's going to be in it he wants to follow the brawn James ... LeBron left Cleveland to go to Miami to win championships to get people off his back\nAnd now I Will do whatever I Want to the rest of my career that's with Kevin Iran's gonna do he's got a lot of business interests in New York He's always spoke glowing lily of New York and Kevin Durant if someone who is simply going to\nTalk around free agency for the next few months I that's what he's going to do sure but we get big evidence after the game tonight about how he feels about New York he's going to go someplace after this year because he will say hey championships ticked off my resume I'm never going to be the warriors guy that's always", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
