ascribe to it that's what they've been shooting for forever they want it to be an eight neatly they do and here's what they got all\nBut you still find over all of these years the patriots were always really good the Steelers were always really good right you'd have a team like the Packers who are always really good the saints\nAre usually really end up for Lonnie hawks were really really good I'm going through a bunch of teams every or you could say these six or eight teams are always going to be harder to need to be\n... not after week five usually it's at the end of the year or two when they

tough schedule they've shown how good they are like the jaguars are kinda like that where there are three and two but they've had a tough schedule they won some big games they've lost a couple of better surprising or like losing as bad as they did to the chiefs last week\nBut there's some teams that are still OK but the only teams that really you can say hey these are contenders near shore that are going to be contenders at the end of the year or the chiefs in the rams\nCan you say about any of these teams you know what I Know for certain\nThis is a team that is going to be there and when the division at the end\nIt's it's much harder this year than in any years past no it's\nThe beauty of it though is that there there are these teams that have had to fuel things out through the

do some players were energized by it some couldn't stand it\nSome people loved it some people hate it but that would have been something to see here comes Jimmy Butler everybody hates me you can't win without me and then he goes in with a bunch of scrimmage is with guys that are going to be under the bench guys or might not even make the team\nAnd then he just walks out and he walks in an interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols this is where the drama begins coming up in a minute you'll hear from Jimmy buckets and exactly what guys like Jimmy Butler\nAnd desert Bryant Antonio Brown and levy on bell

was back off the injury list Lorenzo Ball Four points\nTo steals want assist in Seventeen minutes and ... for a big one\nFrom three point range something we'll get to a lot of in a bit but\nWe're talking about Jimmy Butler and his desire to be trained in how it manifested itself today is first practice with the timber wolves because he's been away from the team for a while yelled at the team's GM you can't believe in without me and then went out and bought a bunch of scrimmage is with guys who may not even make the team against the starters well that's a pretty good statement\nThat you can't win without me and I'll watch I'll go take my eyes and beat the crap out of your superstar\nEnded up itself now they're saying look these are the guys you want to build around that the biggest criticism here for Jimmy Butler in the back story of all of this forgetting today's commentary is that he hates the fact that people don't work\nAnd that the younger players don't work that after these old easy easy ripe old soul at twenty nine but he was like this in Chicago it was the same exact red asked\nType of attitude there of guys not coming to practice and putting in a full day's work he called out veterans then called out the coaching staff or being a little laissez faire and and now he's doing it here now with Cuba do 'cause they're kindred spirits but there's a typical knows is only so much he can do\nYeah he said hey I Love Jimmy came in he brought us fiery brought this she could tell he's got his supporters within the organization there's only\nSo much he's going to be able to do the right as well here's your your young star yeah I\nWant out and wages and Carlin the towns are the future they want to keep them\nBut here he was walking off the court and going on television with ESPN is Rachel Nichols so you know this was all\nOrchestrated for their acting job sit Debbie instead of talking to the local media I'm going to go sit down he hasn't been there all year by local guys I'm going to go sit night with Rachel Nichols he probably could have should have gone to talk to the local media I mean that that's that's the right thing to do what\nHe did go to Rachel Nichols and she asked him hey what was going on with this was everything you said everything that went on a practice was that All right was was that the message you wanted to send and here's Jimmy Butler\nA lot of it is true but you got to say I haven't played basketball and and and so long so passionate and I love the game and I don't do it for any other reason except for it to come\nAnd go up against the best to try to prove that I can hang so all my emotion came out at one time in the fall it could be it could be but a\nNew I think so no 'cause you got to be honest I'm being honest do I think so no I'm being honest with you but it's everybody's going to be honest no\nNo everybody's not going to be honest I give you going to say what's on the auto what Jim you said that in practice and oh hello honest I don't care and that's what we do about it now let me on it\nSo there's Jimmy Butler talking about in telling the truth and saying is is it ... it might be honest I Want you to be honest but I'm On but if we're both on it then we can be honest with each other but I'm going to start being honest first them to drink honest cheap because people are buying that now and then you drink the honesty there were being\nHonest with each other do you think he are now has that land as a potential sponsor oh that hey I'm Jimmy Butler and I'm being honest honesty\nBut this is what players like Jimmy Butler does Bryant\nBrown and levy on bell don't get\nTheir futures lie elsewhere than their current teams right Jimmy Butler's gotta go someplace else he can't there's too much stuff has happened\nThey just got to find the right trade foreign levy on bells going to be on a different team other than the Pittsburgh Steelers does Brian somewhere else other than the cowboys Antonio Brown eventually the deal is going to get done with his antics in two years when they can get out of his deal they're going to get out\nBut these could be looking for a new contract when he's thirty two their ultimate Destini lies other places\nAnd none of them realize that they're being evaluated\nOn their behavior wild things are going bad with current teams\nBecause anybody who wants to levy on bell or sticky about cutting a big check for him or for Jimmy Butler because Jimmy ... comes with a new contract it's not just we trade for Jimmy Butler as we trade for Jimmy ... and he wants a four year deal\nThat's going to pay the maximum anybody that wants to cut that check wants to say OK I Want to know the Jimmy butler is going to be OK guy to give that money to but it's not going to be a season and a half\nYeah bye discover card become a new card member discover card will match all the cash that you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more discovered dot com slash match ups limitation\nThank you for bringing a piece of the other day for play me for the pizza we just thought it might be already done nicely done\nHe has gone into I literally just passed him in a home in ... seconds you left this room that piece of pizza is going to get my God I Know to get myself a cup of coffee I bring back some napkins and plates I think we'd have a\nYou know a nice a quarterly meal [noise]\nAnd uh no not a wealthy over here took care of business that feeds is your job down on his life and I've done I've made on that kid Miami's got to be excited and a Jimmy Butler comes down there you know if he knows he's going to get a good effort I'm sure every time I had a Jimmy Butler\nUh speaking of the NBA or there's a reason why the number to the top two trending topics on Twitter tonight are LeBron and Alonzo\nLeBron James playing his first game alongside lawns all balls been out in the pre season with an injury until now eight and I have to go in the fourth quarter and the Lakers lead the warriors one oh three Ninety seven for the Lakers yeah sprint anger leads a team of twenty six points LeBron\nFifteen ten rebounds five assists he is not played yet in the fourth quarter\nMeanwhile Alonzo ball now up to seven point yeah body odd does have forced deals and a couple of us is this is the thing though about Lorenzo ball when LeBron was in the game Lorenzo was at three points\nA steel one assessed and one rebound\nLeBron is out of the game now has a plate in the fourth quarter what's happened to Alonzo stats he went from\nThree points one and one now he's seven or steals for rebounds to assess this is just a few minutes I'm not saying somebody's going to be a triple double guy but when LeBron is not on the court this is\nWhen ... was going to have his effect because ... needs the ball in his hands he needs to be the guy that is coming down from his guard position on defense to grab a rebound and start the the break the other way he's got to be the one to have the ball in his hands\nAnd that's going to happen but it's only going to happen when LeBron isn't on the court because you seem abroad that's why they don't really need to point guard having Kyrie Irving is why the the\nCats were so good you know but Kyrie gave the ball up till abroad and a lot because LeBron needs to have it he's not someone that hey I can find my way to get open our leader for a couple of seconds I'm shocked like\nNo LeBron needs to see the court he needs to see what he wants to do and make the right place sometimes now you pass\nSometimes the drivers who but he needs the ball so Alonzo and you expect great production from him this year it's not going to happen\nWell what brought us on the court because what bronze going to get all that he's going to have the ball for the majority of the time was just going to bring the ball down he's not going to spend time sitting there ... it's going to be after a few seconds but nobody's opened well let's get it to LeBron LeBron's going to make the playoff instantly so if you're expecting to see hey\nI see a big uptick in lawns those stats and his impact on the game it's not going to be the trust when when when\nLeBron is out of the game and launch those in that she's going to get his numbers oh yeah he'll have his\nMoments second unit those few minutes that LeBron sits out that's going to be the curiosity right as to how they manage ... minutes during the regular season now many games he takes off he played all eighty two\nA year ago and when they get along so ball still only so much he's going to be able to do what he's working with that first unit because LeBron will at the ball you'll have some back cuts maybe\nSome lay up and fast break opportunities but they're certainly not spotting him up issue because we saw that epic disaster rear its head that that'll be the shot heard round the world although if people are good they do a little Vegas this direction they keep going on there's anger in it\n'cause right now the the reigning Ingram in the next superstar and make the man in waiting water column ... and and video highlight reels being rung up they're not only here in Los Angeles but nationally to say look he's the guy he's the guy LeBron's camp were not Lorenzo ball\nWill launch a lot you'll be the guy he's going to be the guy when LeBron starts to break now it's not going to be launched so getting these only know what I mean LeBron getting starting the breaks and that's the guy who's going to see his point total jump up is going to be Ingram but he's the guy flying up and down the court looking up tonight\nTwenty six points one of the rest of his that let's look like five rebounds want us to yeah I mean as we could already him yeah I was going to be he's going to be the one dimensional score this year because\nThat's the role that he's going to play because LeBron needs people to play specific roles on this team bringing 'em sock it to be the guy he was the last couple of years where\nHey some nights yeah ten points some nice has got twenty five but he's near a triple double he's got eight assists he's got twelve rebounds nobody's going to have those kinds of numbers because those aren't the rules the players play with LeBron James half\nGoing into his body growing injuries game Fifteen or Seventeen from the free throw line tonight and little little hacking Ingram kind of thing going on here and dominating and making the most of it but you're trying to figure out who that next score is going to be we've seen it from coups ... seven sixteen tonight a Jewish six from three he's got twenty\nAnd humid and that's the natural order you would expect those year three guys putting in points when you get a big effort out of a K. C. P. and some of the others perhaps maybe a little bit of a bonus time but it it's anger on where you're expecting to most great and we talk with Bill clash year earlier\nLike lots of balls on that for a month so the trade deadline cut a window to see how he fits if he fits and where things are going and if you're bad pops off again\nAnd you see that happening on pets are all\nWell and can you imagine if this is what the Lakers second unit is going to look like when it comes out Hart Stevenson ball these Leon ... let's just say where the Lakers are right now to broaden Ingram in the front porch of al McGee Rondo continuous Caldwell pope let's say that's they're starting five\nThat next unit coming off is really damaging and these are guys that the Lakers were counting on without LeBron these guys will be in the starting lineup but now it's going to be it could be a second unit this is why the Lakers can finished second in the west and get as far as the western constantly vinyl facts about the west everybody took a step back used\nIn last um component parts and then the rest was a muddled mess with three tonight no reason they can't jump ahead of all of them with Ron involved will have\nMore on this game and a big story out of the NFL coming up next to Jason Smith show with my car man this is Fox Sports radio [noise]\nIf you suffer from E.

AOL [noise] download it now\n[noise]\nFox Sports trendy and [noise]\nSaying ... expect your name to be up in the rafters here at the end of your career with the Lakers it was launch those team of our ball was running his mouth every five minutes it's Alonzo team it's this it's that it's all this now\nHere we are it's LeBron's team and ... is a spare parts it's never going to be boy lawns and was really really good it's he's going to be a\nSide\nCharacter in the LeBron James Ronald we talked about the few minutes ago if the Lakers second unit turns out to be ... Beasley Lorenzo Stevenson adjacent heart\nThat's a really good second unit\nThat's one of those like wow these guys could gel like the raptors and suddenly they put out there so I could eat it last year they blow teams away if this turns out to be their second unit oh my God would they be really really good\nThis is why I say the Lakers can finished second in the west and they should finished second and they should lose the wars in the western conference finals 'cause they're just not quite there yet at that level but what I'd be funny\nAbout it is with that debt\nWhat what do we say about the war zone last year they didn't have the death\nParticularly in in the middle in with the big men so some second unit you might have a distinct advantage that and since LeBron James I born he can still play forty eight at night yeah\nYeah I mean they'll they'll cut it down a little bit for him in the beginning because they don't want to do it to him right away he got a buddy who actually that's always going to be but for Lorenzo ball he's realizes and all of our bowl realizes now that boy are they really don't need me anymore uh okay that was pretty boy\nThat that was fantastic ... land I don't I don't mean that does stop your train of thought there but that was the most spectacular miss dunk we've seen in a while it was a big mess done all the lights here and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios that are not blinding me\nBut for a long so\nIf I can finish now I cannot okay so where is it now is he's\nHe realizes that he is on his last chance as bill plastic you said when he joined us earlier in the show this is a three or four months audition can LeBron play with Alonzo I have no doubt the beginning of the year the next couple of months LeBron is going to be very\nWelcoming to Alonzo ball let's deal we can do all the giving advice all these things because the one thing LeBron doesn't want to do is he never wants to be seen as being a bad team a being a bad guy you everything he can to help blondes oh ball knowing full well if it does it work\nHe's easily tradable easily and love or ball knows that if I say one thing that turns out to be wrong that could be at that can be you know what I'm done with them I'm done with his dad I'm moving on because LeBron already doesn't like him for the war of words they got into last year when the brunt of the say keep my kids' names out of your mouth\nWhen he was talking about why is kid isn't as good wine lines will be better\nAnd so that that's the that's where they sit right now it's the it's a last chance time for Lorenzo ball he's gone from I'm the savior of this team to now he could be gone and what do we tell you all last year lawns those time with the Lakers is going to be short\nBecause ... will burn it out they will burn out of time to the Lakers so you know what we're done and now especially\nThat timeline has been sped up because getting LeBron James he doesn't need Lorenzo ball threatening him passes he's going to be the guy starting the break he'll be okay with Ron do continue is called well pumping the starting lineup and ... really is it's going to be a case where if he gets traded by the deadline if they realize you need a shooter we need something else\nI'm not going to be surprised at all about trade and I thought it might be one more year after this but this could actually happened during the year so I could actually be early on my prediction of arms are getting traded yeah and it has nothing to do with\nAnybody spouting their mouth off it just merely basketball neat you got a team that needs the second ... it could be bland and anger could be ... and those could be the guys that you're leaning on the backup LeBron James when he takes as we know that ... not that\nWe know that we know we you know the comparisons to Jason Kidd a year ago that that asked whether he gets that court division and can consistently put up those kind of numbers that's fine but ten eight and eight\nThat's great but that's that transcended and it's certainly not going to get them to that next level where you're building a team\nAround ... ball so if he shows at all there's still plenty of teams that need guards that can use a young player of his ilk still on the rookie deal\nAnd you can bring in another shooter another defensive stop or whatever the case may be so yeah it's a short audition and it's more just how he fits into the offense than anything else\nLakers it's a final beat the warriors one twenty three one Thirteen\nAnd the bronze late Eighteen minutes and finish five assists shy of a triple double this was the night he had we got more on this game plus a big take away from the NFL coming off a week five heading into weeks six tomorrow night this is talk radio\nWho\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise]\nHis Fox Sports radio sets the tone\nAnd this is where you get your an NFL\nFor morning I'm going to run through all of my stories in the NFL tonight and there's two big takeaways from this game is your house\n\nIf you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know the first who actually peach baskets or the war in basketball is bounce you're then the cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game well here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nTrue car also helps people get used cars that is right true isn't just for buying new cars with their certified dealer network and nationwide inventory of nearly one million used cars you'll enjoy real pricing on actual inventory and simpler buying experience whether you buy new or use\nAnd it was true car you can see what others paid so they know if they're getting a good deal before buying they're also more likely to enjoy it faster buying experience by connecting with true car certified dealers when you're ready to buy a new or used car check out your car and enjoy a more confident car buying experience some features\nAnd what it all comes down to it is as long as LeBron James is healthy he'll make it makes sense as best you can use then obviously missing or ... and a couple of other changes but your gut Carmelo Anthony comes in you will celebrate him and you'll have that rocket Jersey\nBy holidays [laughter] I don't know any including the headband well you know if he had gone to the sun's maybe 'cause it's orange okay but I'm not going to buy a rage I'm not gonna buy a winner and New Jersey now I Can't find one that got together\nBecause if you're going along you could go and buy one of every teen you've been on\nLike a little Carmelo sides gave you a title walking to I Want to get a house with a long hallway so I could do all the mellow jerseys Jay Leno and all that but I couldn't get even a hood too attached to it that's your job oh well now it would be your alter ego who de Mello now let\nYou go with or without am going to take the boot off tonight for ... ...\nDoes anybody wait wait patent pending has anybody invented the the\nUh replaceable ... like a sweatshirt that you can wear with or without depending on whether you think you need it or not I'm sure there's got to be a ... crew that that has a hoodie that looks like it but you can you know take it off\nIf you want whether it's Velcro or you know buttons or whatever it is that's a good question we're going to have to figure that out because if it doesn't exist I have to question why like I Want to wear a hoodie along car ride but I don't want the honey to push up and make my neck uncomfortable so I'm going to take off the only make it occurred I like the Wainwright\nPatent pending patent pending patent pending\nWe had to obey story from the NFL coming up next and yes\nThe Lakers should finished second in the west\nAnd make it to the western conference finals when you're hiring you don't want to waste time sorting through dozens of relevant resumes you wanted to fish in a way to get to a shortlist are qualified cabinet so that's why you need indeed dot com posted job in minutes set up screener questions based on your job requirements then\nZero in on qualified candidates using it to an online desperate discover why three million businesses using deep fryer and posted job today at indeed dot com slash fire that's indeed dot com slash higher search for greatness search indeed\nThe big takeaway from five whole weeks of the NFL and the minute but first here's what's happening with the cars in DC\nWell Tex Leonard and getting a lot of nice or\nComments said from everybody who's who in basketball Kobe Bryant Michael Jordan all kinds of coaches coming out\nThe legendary coach who pioneered the triangle often passed away today at age Ninety six it was a long time assistant hundred Phil Jackson like multiple NBA championships what does the bowls six I'm a Chicago and for what the L. A. and Lakers\nAnd disgruntled guarded Jimmy Butler return to practice today for the tables for the first times is demanding to be traded things got heated butler yelled at teammates coaches front office members and then of course he confirmed a report on ESPN\nBut it is true but you got to say I haven't played basketball and and and so long I Am so passionate and I love the game and I don't do it for any other reason except for it to come and go up against the best to try to prove that I can hang so all my emotion came out at one time\nOn line car shopping and be confusing not any more of a troop price from ... car now you know the exact price you pay for your next Carmen the true Carl enjoy more confident car buying experience it's final from Anaheim and overtime coyotes to be the next three to two capitals with a five to whenever the Golden Knights seven for when for the flyers at the senators\nAnd because coach Mike Tomlin doesn't have enough on his plate to deal with the NFL is find the Steelers head coach for criticizing the officials following Sundays went against the falcons that'll cost him [noise] twenty five grand thank you very much and\nThey did they say that we're live from the guy goes studios where Fifteen minutes can save your Fifteen Percent or more car insurance more info visit Geico dot com love more on LeBron and lawn so coming up in a little bit maybe we can get Lorenzo balls Arab all three of justice prospered refuses to get that highlight the\nPlanet I refuses to get that ... that well I always found that how it sounded all I'll pull it off in winter and and play it on my computer as Siri I've asked him for that highlight for an hour and a half because we can't get it yeah I Know we can't get no kid that\nI Know it's it's the biggest player has a dog can get it really is the biggest play yeah Sheila bronze eighty four was the biggest plan that was\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] there it is all brawn James and the big forty four that ended the first half part of the Lakers victory tonight over the Golden State warriors and yes before we get to the NFL for a second\nIf an exhibition game it's a preseason game that was played in Vegas when I say this is used to be able to get glimpses of what a team is going to be shorter than the regular season and watching this game tonight\nYou got the glimpses of boy this is really what the Lakers team can be they're going to be the biggest story all year every night they play they are going to be the biggest story and I don't see there being along adjustment period can I see them being five and five and their first names yeah I can see that but after that doesn't there'll be\nSeven and five nine and six\nTwelve and six Thirteen and seven\nFifteen and Seventeen Eighteen in a twenty into how it's\nGoing to go do this like we do during the NFL season where we go all eighty to let's go now I Know they live out there that it\nCome out we can get a whole hour worth show will and more I I I Am promising here we are going to get that Lorenzo ball call coming up next on the show we're going to get it but\nThe thing about the NFL because by this time tomorrow will be breaking down all the votes will back him juniors antics over the course of the uh opening game of weak sixth against the eagles so excited for that I Can't wait that's all we need is oh back in the old el Barclay odds going to be awesome awesome tomorrow night\nBut the one thing you can say about the NFL through five weeks is that it is not been this mediocre\nIn years\nAnd everybody likes the idea of parity because you had your team can be involved but hey the jets or two and three I Love the fact we're game out of first place the AMCs despite the fact they played like ask for three weeks in a row\n[noise] hey I Know that I work at it there too and hey hope is an okay thing isn't it when we always argue Shawshank metal ... that was the other will always say it's a bit you'd never ... thing you are always a dangerous thing God\nYou're only only maybe I'm flipping the script maybe maybe I'm going to find good are you really why not are you really sure you could have set up there either so of all the teams in the NFL\nThe only two that you really believe in now that don't have problems or the chief and the rams oh you can look at every team and say oh God yeah the chiefs defense can be a little bit of a problem but\nThe chief and the rams are five and no and they are steaming towards home field advantage in the playoffs and likely going to the super bowl that's so good they are everybody else has problems yeah you want to think that", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "11"}
