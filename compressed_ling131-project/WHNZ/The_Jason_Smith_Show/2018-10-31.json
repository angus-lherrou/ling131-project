interesting this from a network and they were also lecturing about tone a when you have people on the network that say things like this audio somebody sixteen\nI have to have to agree with long hair I think you know the fact that at one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization as this president has radicalized so many more people

it's I mean it's there's a real\nCaravan that's coming up in fact it's apparently a the size of it is bigger than a lot of small towns Daily Caller has a piece where it talks about how fourteen thousand people that's what the main caravan has swelled to according to a major Mexican newspaper\nThat the the L universality claims to have received the fourteen thousand number from quote municipal authorities or\nAn F. southwestern Mexican cities diocese and national migration Institute daily mail separately reports that the number includes up to ten thousand in the main Mexican caravan with anywhere from Fifteen hundred to two thousand more in a second Guatemalan caravan and an additional twenty five hundred planted to mobilize in Honduras and El Salvador\nNo Mexican national migration Institute cited by LA universal did not respond to ah they didn't they they were they were the ones who wish you the number for the the first group that's still going through Mexico\nI'm just so this\nThere's some back and forth as to what size it is a piece that it's a quote biggest migrant caravan ever a un spokesperson said it's about Seventy two hundred people\nLast week the Mexican government said it was about forty five hundred people but now their main one of the papers there and Mexico along with the national migration Institute say it's a ... in total with all the different groups it's about fourteen thousand which is a lot\nThat's a lot and they say and and may twenty Eighteen the U.S Census Bureau wrote that the United states as a nation of small towns and they were talking about how you know you have you you have um some Seventy six percent of these small towns have fewer than five thousand people so it's bigger than a lot of small towns that are coming\nUh if if those numbers from the migrant Institute and the Mexican media are to be believed and one of the uh the caravan was asking for transportation\nThe Honduran can't advance caravan they they wanted to ... they're wanting to reach the Texas border they well I think it's the Tijuana crossings where they're looking at going for but they've been demanding that the Mexican government provide transportation for them as far as Mexico City\nOr what\nThey and remember keep in mind this isn't really about amnesty this isn't about it because they rejected benefit than amnesty from from Mexico already\nThey've they've already rejected that [noise] so according to the Associated Press the caravan that's going through southern Mexico is demanding that the Mexican government help it thousands of participants reached Mexico City even as a smaller group of Central Americans entered the country presumably with the intention of joining us\nAnd Mexican Government has shown no inclination to assess the exception of its migrant protection agency giving some of the caravan stragglers ride to the next town over the weekend a one group supporting the care of and said it hopes to hold meetings in Mexico city with federal lawmakers to discuss their rights and the caravans future\nOkay well and then\nSome of the uh there have been some that I uh we'd known that they've talked about getting buses before a meanwhile one of the ah things that was reporter by MSN is that there are seven hundred and fifty thousand pending cases before us immigration courts as is\nUs immigrated and here's here's the other thing you don't have to march to like a border checkpoint to demand asylum or ... or ... or to demand asylum they were again they were offered asylum by Mexico I said amnesty earlier in Minnesota and they were offered asylum by Mexico and they rejected it\nSo it's not about asylum you don't have to march to a border checkpoint to apply for asylum you can do that in your home country so all of the I'm Sorry but it's theater\nIt's all theater because you don't have to march to the southern border to demand asylum you can do that within your own country and the

time\nNor McDonald's new shows is very good it's so awkward\nI his I particularly enjoy ... and ... and Drew Barrymore the ones that you think are would be odd for him to be on stage with are sometimes the most entertaining you know I almost like him better with people who are not comedian as opposed to other comedians because they just want to rip off each other 'cause he was on with Chevy anyways Chevy Chase\nAnd it was I mean they're funny they're both funny but I just like\nYou know I don't know I but it's\nVery good stuff so uh and I I'll have somewhere to watch tonight anyway

about us if you want those I'm Serious watched the which\nIt's really good it is really oh and I also watch Veronica\nI don't I didn't let my kids watch bronco because it had to do a double stuff mental that my kids watch doubled stuff um but I watched rockets subtitled and it cast really well\nOr the girl who plays the lead is a really good at what she does but that was really kind of also that was really sad and depressing it hadn't it hadn't well\nNo not going to say anything but the which if I'd recommend one for you to watch the witch\nAnd it was really good an elite and that is really good one of the uh the chick who was the sister who is catlin start sister on game of Thrones is the mom in that\nMovie mhm really really really good so you have to go check that out if I if I had to recommend one new horror film deal it would be that one it is a mind job though just be prepare my job All right so we are\nOne of the I had what I don't even think I got around everything on that I wanted to hit yet um we entered into this is what I wanted to look at I read this this morning this is actually the first thing I read today\n[laughter] New York mag has a profile of twelve people and why they probably won't vote and it was amazing how someone could not figure out how to register to vote and they didn't know how to mail things then quote\nI tried to register for the twenty sixteen election but it was beyond the deadline when I tried to do it and I hate mailing stuff it gives me anxiety I just don't remember like how I oh my gosh so we teach kids that they're eleven differently in different types of genders but we don't teach them how to males things\nWere registered to vote are you serious\nWhat like what for crying out loud like one girl said in high school I didn't know or vice president name was Joe Biden\nIn school many Christmas\n[noise] so\nThat was the first thing I read this morning and I thought you really want to get out of bed because it does not give me a lot of hope for the future Steve you know how to mail stuff right I just want to do a quick welfare check you know how to mail stuff right correct Oh thank heavens and so I'm so pleased you're already a step ahead of everybody else\nYeah now today and stupidity Mr Cain I Know we have a good one\nYeah we do well Josh hero is ... attorney general he is a Democrat [noise]\nAnd um it looks like here he's trying to [noise]\nHe's tried to quit Trump with these bad acts as far as you know the bomber and the ah you know shooting innocent or go with that but\nSomehow how's Trump allowing someone uses words [noise] I don't understand is coming so I just thought it was really\nTakes this isn't about partisanship or whether I support the president [noise] this is about making sure that when the president comes to Pennsylvania He brings with him words of feeling\nThat he speaks with more clarity something that the president seemingly has been unable to do he allows whose words to be misappropriated by people who they use those words twice flick evil\nSo he trusts just allowing his words to be misappropriated you're allowing that somehow ...\nSo I guess when you speak words you didn't have to worry about who's I mean come on I'm pretty sure that\nThere have been some serial killers have used similar words to you like\nThe right even junction Berkeley so what are we why are you doing this is the this is the ... you know curbing speech and I'm definitely not a fan of them yeah well there you go\nFolks that does it prior to date in stupidity\nHave a great Halloween
