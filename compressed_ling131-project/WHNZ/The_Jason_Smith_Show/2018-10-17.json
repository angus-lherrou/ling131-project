I mean I just that horse race came out of nowhere\nAnd the fact that he can just wait it out and he did that and didn't even think anything of it you know he did he is just like whatever horse race and to top it off of there you go through yeah and then he goes off and start talking about palm pay on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] so and at the same time this is one of the reasons why I Do think now bear with me here I Do think that there is some value in it and let me tell you so\nYou have people like oh I don't know maybe said the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who thinks he's going to be getting frog he I don't know and some of these other world leaders and you know the Iran's theocracy those did they see him acting like\nThis on Twitter how do you think that he's going to react if he didn't get what do you want when he's talking with them and negotiations about the escalation\nSo I Do like the idea that our front of me and maybe potential enemies think that our guys crazier than they are there's a value in that because you're going to walk on eggshells because you're gonna be like well my gosh this guy may call me horse face next and press the red button you don't\nIt peace through

in which she apparently missed identified victims of abuse without even their consent\nUh she apologized 'cause she had an an an ad where a newspaper ad aimed at her opponent where\nVictims of domestic violence sexual abuse in rape were listed and they were missing identified [noise] she said that\nShe only recently learned that several of the women named in the ad had an authorized it or not actual survivors of abuse she says quote this is incompetent it was wrong should've never have happened it was a very flagrant era of the\nCampaign and I own it oh that's kind of a big deal\nWow\nWow Democrats have a real hard time with that don't they they have a real tough time and like not leaking stuff and just using people like that guy Lee stop and uh also Julio Castro says that he is likely to run and twenty twenty\nHe's one of my favorite Castro's now you guys have you guys I\n... if you listen to this radio\nProgram for any length of time I told you that you should watch these brothers who won and walking Castro their mother is a cofounder of what Russia\nAnd they're down in San Antonio and he was I think the what used to be the mayor of San Antonio yeah he'll Castro was the mayor of San Antonio and one of my favorite stories about them happened several years ago at a river walk parade\nIn San Antonio they get the barges out and they decorate them an avid river walk parade and land catcher was on the city council and he was also running for he was running for mayor bad like a fundraiser or something that he needed to go to and so he skipped the river walk parade and in his spot\nA installed his identical twin brother Joaquin Castro it's like the plot from parent trap but with mayors\nIn San Antonio and so they were on this barge in what he was on the barge and he was waving at everybody and the radio host that was announcing it said\nHe was never told that it was going to be walking Castro that he I mean it's just that really aren't Castro on the list and so people were waving it apparently they just all pretended like he was the mayor and apparently he was the who's a city councilman and and\nUh it inadvertently was uncovered and their excused\nWas quote I Can't help we can't help but that we look alike\nAnd walking that well\nThey were shouting at me and I said no it's Joaquin but nobody couldn't hear me 'cause so many people were allowed there like twenty thousand people there\n[noise] [laughter] what do you really believe that no\nIt's walking my brother's in a fund raiser I'm just pretending to be yeah\nLike kind of fifty ... isn't that I mean like an identical twin or the president does that really does it do you think they that they could be doing something like Lindsey ... parent trap\nCould be I mean there's always a possibility but then what if they don't get along and one of them to be doing nefarious stuff from the other one is ... you know it just couldn't get messy it's ...\nI Would think it would make it dangerous for the twin the other one who's not in the White House who doesn't get Secret Service detail true because he would look exactly like a brother that's kinda creepy\nThat's what I Would be

totally folk is it a good song sure it's a it's a nice thought I don't really listen to John Denver but I Know that dog everybody knows it's not\nGoing to second kings been movies actually referred to a lot of the movie\nWell yeah yeah it absolutely was and all the kids all the ... kids playing fallen no that's not what he's like well I just think it's just and both the both of my boys like it's just there was a great is it's really the greatest countries on and so\nThis could not be had so dinner last night and I had ... potted\nBeef stew and dinner last night was a two hour affair and which we took the kids through country music\nAnd introduce them to like Hank senior and kitty wells and a Charlie Pride and Merle Haggard and George George Jones in straight\nAnd we took a little detour in the eighties and Kenny Rogers and you know Dolly in bed decline and\nI mean um we just went through the whole just describes a Johnny Cash just scratched the surface ...\nAnd\nI just I could not believe that I was looking at these little their little sweet innocent little faces so clueless about music\nGot all of them are just like that's not a country song it's folk unlike sounds pretty cool to like oh my gosh but it's not\nIt's not though like listen to Charlie Pride and then listen to this don't listen to the kitty wells and then a little less than it is done well it's been a hang junior enlisted in the song like that not the same\nOh my gosh the productions different though I mean like I was too but I played Charlie Daniels forum\nI play devil went down to Georgia oh that's a good one\nWhich I Know that song but when I was on stage with him at the convention like I was there was no way I was going to sing Charlie they know the song while he's on stage while he's on stage with him because it's a weird key for me and I would have to think so low to where it was so uncomfortable or a lot ... is though there was no it was going to happen\nAnd I was just me and my guy stood there like ... we didn't know what to do I make now I just anyway place of Charlie Daniels and he was like well that\nSettles so that's kind of blew that is really more blue grass and like oh my gosh\nThere's some bluegrass elements what it's like\nOh my gosh [noise]\nAnd he's like yeah we can play the fiddle pretty well like we've been pretty well you saw him play why what is the matter with you\nWell Johnny Cash is what I owe these amazing us who are outlaw\nOutlaw country we had a whole like we diverged and had a whole lesson on outlaw country\nIt sounds like a two hour affair it home for dinner that honky tonk come up we discuss hockey town and we were kind of had to who is it that we owe and then I'm Marty ... his name I Can't remember right now I cannot believe I'm having a total brain part\nA oh a ... although Paso out in West Texas the Paso I fell in love with the Mexican\nGr anyway played that and they were like that sounds a little to western like oh my gosh\nBut you think John Denver country so it was like this huge thing last night um and I didn't let them go to bed until the lesson was finished 'cause it was like I just can't deal with us right now I'm like I Can't you know I'm next to this is not this cannot be like I just I Can't I just can't [noise]\nSo you're doing the Lord's work though you know I feel like it's it's important for parents to make sure that their children have good musical taste otherwise that towel enough more set becomes popular for how you get you know some of these bands out here that are just auto tune like everything's auto too much to you know stop\nIt's important it's part of your jobs as parents to impart a good musical tastes and your children [noise]\nSo anyway we had a nice lesson and uh but they I mean they I was like you guys can like John Denver the tests not country ... today and stupidity gain a Bernie\nSanders was a very uh\nYou've been you know anything you can say against Trump is and how we can squeeze it in anti Trump message is important to him so here he is talking about how Trump's just ... [noise] can agree with\nThe oil for food and said you'll recall when he was an ... with Trump was an oath linked with ... and so\nWe are nothing to do\nNo involvement and trying to solve its harsh us elections well every intelligence agency and the United states government settled was ... was this the poop told me they all do involvement you consider our little ... you know ... years ago a great you know friends of\nKim Jong own in North Korea one of the worst autocrats in detail understand that we're all in in the world he loves the guy\nI mean although my gosh you talk a lot and other people around me\nAnd the ... we have a president was very strong record what ... what kind of authoritarian\nOr a chair and how many times did he say then what would you be regulated give money back to your people if you're an authoritarian now would you vote in the American\nGovernment how to work just as our chauffeur today I have a great and I back with you tomorrow [laughter]\n[noise]\n...\nYou can listen hard are free I are ready to go out [noise]\nAnd they ended up voting a new one and the ball and\nYou imagine if this if this breaks because now this you're talking about the defending World Series champion who did this is just like Spygate it's the defending champions that has built an empire on stealing signs\nThis is a start us now three different teams talking to a major league baseball about it the ... the Dodgers\nThe Indians and oh by the way the red Sox now finally caught man genie who finally caught the guy doing it I mean this is this one from being a this is the miners' story and maybe the guy was said who knows so now it's what kind of role did this have in the Astros winning the world zero and\nYou had the allergy score a writer who's now in the dugout for the red Sox who was the bench coach last year in the planet who's done so it's the Eric man Jeannie effect going on there and like well you know we got to know some things so now you add more fuel to the fire\nIn so major league baseball Rob ... not going to be able to just do a ceremonial handing off of a trophy at this point they've got some legitimate work to do and this is really potentially damaging here now we joked about it earlier but it is true the cardinals did some really terrible things in terms of\nElectronic espionage and stealing scouting reports and all sorts of the guys that are tied to the asterisk by\nA and [laughter] really nothing happened Mm Mm of any substance\nIn that regard that kind of came and went without much much reporting it and much handling on anybody's part this one as the playoffs are are heating up not what major league baseball had in mind\nTells me this tells me that I've been doing sports talk radio for a long time because you know they always say history repeats itself\nBut usually when you get when you get a crazy story like Spygate it takes a generation to repeat itself that were there were there again you know we had\nWe had it in football in the early to thousands of now we're getting close to the end of the teams and and we got it again and major league baseball now that says this deal inside this is how they got illegally stealing signs illegally stealing side using a ...\nHis baritone day Thursday and and I am so excited to tell you about this Ken Hi heart radio podcast where I sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around I don't feel like I look like anybody else or feel like anybody else we're becoming closer together more empathetic that's what they instilled in me in the very beginning\nThat you are part of a revolution can make families families ...\nHis ... and if you haven't already you have to check out our radio news podcast twenty ... this is the show where we sit with musicians and experts to talk about how DNA is changing our lives and the world around us\nThis week we got real with Melissa Etheridge as we discuss what does it mean to be family family's family you can make family family's loss that you bond with\nNo that's a load of crap because you don't do something like this which could conceivably get you caught cause the patriots were pretty brazen\nThe Astros are pretty brazen if they're you know standing next to the dugout and I've got a camera phone you're not doing this unless like this for this period of time unless it's giving you a huge advantage over the other teams\n[noise] quiet and and again and you think about this team and they they have they have done things and and it might be the one as well about the about the uh the data being stolen it in the past with the cardinals and ... and and being a victim on that and the things\nAs the Astros were it it it causes them to the question of why why why is this necessary to even try to do there are many ways candidly that that uh whether it's still in the field of play that ... if if the question is stealing science\nThings that are that are much more above board and and on on the field or there are different ways that they're getting the parts of the science stealing\nHave been going on in the sport for a very very long time but as long as long as it's on the field of play as long as it's not being done with technology a Middle East technology in that in that capacity is it's very much um it's very much understood it's very much a part of the game this is not part of the game\nAnd I think this this if it ends up being proven to be accurate and and and uh certainly doesn't look good for the Astros in this moment but if if it's being a proven and document it it just it looks terrible it looks terrible for it seemed that is that a lot of success has so much talent and and candidly\nDoes not need this is the team that does not need to be a searching for edge in this area of his ends up being what ah what it appears to be on a in many ways so I'm really this is a story that were just become aware of right now today but there there's a lot to it and I think a lot of questions to be asked\nAbout a team that that really is not it should not be in a position where it needs to do something like this because the talent level that they've had a book about for several years\nLast would ... be real quick um why can't the Dodgers either at least take one for the team or or do anything with runners in going position and continue to strike down an alarming rate\nWell that that is the story the series right now and and the brewers poison building to make pitches a big spots it's been a big part of it and despite the youth of their\nStaff but that's where you look at the game tonight already a pretty broad and corporate burns the the two youngest pitchers the brewers have used all season long\nCombining for five scoreless innings and and many of those high leverage pitches ... with with men on base and the Dodgers simply at Johns ... with one of the broadcast I think is absolutely right it's a team that that last games over the world series\nLast year and they now know they're supposed to win and they're playing like a team that knows it is supposed to win which is not always the best thing to do this is the the the one sport I made this point before and I'll I'll make it again as long as the cover of the game\nYou think about our major sports in this country that we boy if you include football basketball baseball hockey and soccer uh this is probably the one sport that you can play better by playing harder you play harder you try harder often it's to your detriment and I think that the the Dodgers right now guys are living in a little bit of that right now here and you know the U.S\nWell except for many McDonald's 'cause he doesn't hustle whenever

earlier this ... sounds like the Astros aid to Boston now in that series games to one game for Wednesday at age thirty\nMaya the bigger story seems to me a story that has come from game one on this series major league baseball now investigating an incident that happened during Houston's when it's an ... and\nAshley simply appear to be shooting video from the photographers and Jason to the red Sox dying out in the league is\nSaying they want to handle the incident internally that are important my ESPN buster only says the Astros assigned the employee to monitor the red Sox to make sure they weren't breaking any rules and the Asian Dodgers abuzz complained about the same kind of issue before in fact the Asian complained that\nAre back in August and Houston players were stealing signals\nAJ hence the Houston skipper was asked about it after\nTonight's game and he said he had heard that something was going on but he was more focused on the games and this is going to be a\nStory that isn't going to go away anytime soon rate news there is this likely to save money system thank God I ... and ... minutes you can say Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance and other baseball news the Marlins will remove the guardian mechanical home runs culture in the left field the Marlins parked\nOutside the stadium to make room for a new standing room only tickets\nAnd I

City forty ... third earlier tonight Celtics won their season opener\nOr the Sixers while five eighty seven but you'd have you back lot from the guy goes studios the Jason Smith show with my best friend my Carmen all you had to walk in the Dodgers tied one if he says the brewers back in the top of the ninth inning\nBut a little bit more on the Spygate thing look this story is just starting to break wide right now because we have major league baseball teams that are documented to have either approach major league baseball or the red Sox with the fact that the Astros were getting video of teams\nThat they were playing and using that information to relay signs to the team in the field one report said it was collapse but the Astros were using and one report said it was was beating a I'm\nA trash can yeah has scanned in in the ... and that was either giving the fastball curve or whatever it is\nNow look there's\nStealing signs and dares doing it illegally right it's just the comparison to Spygate it's amazing and when everybody else takes that tomorrow You're welcome are just like people took our chargers tape but that's fine so and that's the only two or three weeks so here that's right so here's the thing is that\nAs I said with John Paul morose the Astros who of course the night were accused of a ... illegally shooting video of other teams and\nTaking that video during games and giving it to their players so they could steal signals and and know what what pitches another uh you know please teams had had put on more coming is that\nIf you're stealing signs on the field great it's like if you're stealing signs from an opposing side line okay I get it if you're on the sideline and one of your guys these hey coach I just saw you know we were doing this all\nGame what this this is going to wind up being a past the flat whatever it is that's you know what that's completely on ... you got to figure out a way which is why you see many teams in college football I've have player signaling in plays and they used dummies the gummy some guys are stealing stuff in and some stuff doesn't work you do that's on you if\nOne is the head of Peter Griffith need on one side I mean yeah there's a lot of stuff going on whatever you\nDo on the field anything goes it's the same thing for major league baseball you see this all the time where for some reason there'll be a big ... conference in the eighth inning of a one one game watches the runners on second base and the team is wary that someone is stealing signals either because they're stepping off the base with the with a certain foot they're touching a part of their body whatever it is\nThis is a way to steal son if you're doing it during the game yeah that is legit but when you're at the point where you're like the patriots you're shooting video of the other teams to break it down so you can use that in the game and then disseminate that his preparation\nFor Tom Brady the patriots office or the defense yeah no that's a load of crap that's illegal the same thing here using a cell phone to steal signals to be able to get it out so are there so so they know you get the players on the field know what's coming no that's a load of crap and just like with the patriots\nThey wouldn't be doing this if this wasn't giving them a huge benefit they wouldn't be doing it the patriots wouldn't have been stealing those signs all those years if it didn't give them a huge benefit because the chance of getting caught was really great it took me Jeannie to finally do it but\nThe chance of getting caught was great and once the jets reported the patriots were Spygate we had what the lions the rams other tease the eagles all say oh yeah we thought they were doing this for a long time but the jets reported it so now other teams are saying yes this\nWas the other shows that are just throwing things in the way they're doing with the the play caught up with our transmissions or like they they came up with a list about thirty things like hey we're going to try and what did he get find anything on this this this of this because we all had problems but that's what that's the same thing here is that\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you the loan them right for\nCall today in orange\nThe commercial airline industry is booming\nWith this

Thompson the inside insert of his ring it's got diamonds it almost looks like a a coin that you want to flip when you take it off [laughter] I'd be too nervous to walk in with ... a lot\nThere where

beat off we were ... when we were playing music I her radios inside the studio bobcat check it out no\nHeart radio takes you back to the top five\nOctober twenty twelve five an hour\nSo in this story came out today was oh this is kind of fun we first did the story in the first hour the shows this kind of fun it Spygate that's kinda cool you ready for spy game but it's just like a goofy thing at at at the outset right it's a one\nOff kind of odd occurrence and then yell at but wait there's more now but now it's a\nThing because\nAs Jeff passing of Yahoo Sports is able to on earth there are numerous teams who have complained to major league baseball and even warned the red socks that the Astros do this the A's in a series in August talk to a major league baseball felt the Astros were stealing their signs the same way\nAnd the Indians warned the red Sox about it the Astros are doing this the Dodgers feel that the answers are stealing signs in the world series last year illegally not legally not on the field this is using\nNefarious methods I measure good morning with a camera phones to take video and stealing sides so now you have four teams that are involved in\nHey we think they're doing this and now major league baseball is investigating\nSo Spygate has fully come to major league baseball there's so many parallels to the situation with the patriots\nIncluding the fact that now at least the red Sox are the victims of not the er and not be aggressors all my life or go we were the ones that were getting put upon the whole time there were no tapes they were all destroyed\nOakland me well and that's why the Astros said well you we we thought you were taping us fighter\nSo let's play this out because they're much given this story teases now all these teams that have been talking to major league baseball about it\nAnd there's many similarities and I look I've said earlier there's no way that the Astros or patriots are stealing signals unless it's a huge benefit for them because yeah you can have Bill Belichick say yeah I don't know that we got anything we need about yeah you wouldn't be doing it every week that way well in the end it's\nGot to come down to is there enough of a deterrent right in this process one of the things that are done is go back to when the cardinals hacked the Astros scouting system to draft picks and two million dollars I'd say given the\nThe weight and the dollars and cents at stake for extra playoff appearances and everything else I'd say that's not not enough of a deterrent you keep other teams from potentially trying to do the same thing really that's it you're draft picks how high\nNow that that's fine [laughter] because you would you trade that to win the world series who or what do you so much so play this out remember what the patriots reputation was and still is coming off of Spygate they won three superbowls\nHow much of it did they win because they were getting the videotape and they were getting the plays of the other teams because they went through a span when they did not win\nSuper Bowl championships because of it this is a very big deal if it is found that the Astros were doing this for a long period of time and it seems like you have these complaints from different teams and major league baseball that they are\nThis is one of the biggest black guys baseball could get coming since we went through the steroid era of look at all these players who are doing things illegally because baseball is different from so many other sports and that its rules are sacrosanct they are the rules are the rules and they are sacred cows nobody\nHas more unwritten rules then major league baseball there's some things you do some things you don't do and if you don't abide by these unwritten rules or what is fair play than we are going to absolutely murder you for it\nOr players in other sports taken ... of course they are\nOf course they are just take them in football team in basketball everything all golfers are taking of course if they can be eating but we care and baseball because baseball was about records in home runs and if the national pastime and it was a very big deal\nHere is we're Spygate the patriots were getting video and it was a big deal\nAnd the patriots were certainly the scourge of the NFL for awhile and Roger Goodell covering it up really was the worst part of an ally destroy the evidence myself well this is a very big deal yeah but you know it's really embarrassing for the NFL so I'm destroying it so we didn't really get the full\nOutpouring of this story like we should have because Roger Goodell decided yeah I'm sitting on this to help the national football league\n[noise] we're going to get the evidence on this is John Paul morose he told us a little while ago on the show there are so many cameras taping everything in major league baseball they're going to be looking for all of this now so if if this guy this\nComic lock ones doing it there's evidence of it if it's in the playoffs now you go back to a season a series in August against the haves are they still going to have their video ... I mean maybe maybe not so that's going to be tough to go back and see\nBut this will be such a big staying because cheating in baseball we just care about it more than we do cheating in other sports if the jets cheated too when\nI Would go oh I can see why they hate us but man we won the though exciting any other sport the same way people would feel the weight but baseball is different\nCheating in baseball is this is the worst thing and I'm moving a look at what happened to Alex Rodriguez took the guy forever\nTo get back and baseball's good graces and fans good racing these still not all the way there mark Maguire still not all the way they're Raphael ... not been heard from Sammy Sosa is not that none of these guys because cheating in baseball is the worst thing you can do\nAnd you are not coming back from that and how baseball comes back from this is going to be a really big deal\nAbout baseball it's always been interesting to watch the folks that profited quite a bit\nFrom it became the the one jumping the pulpit and start wagging their fingers most vehemently\nOr as that went through but but certainly as you go through all the scandals and like pd in the NFL you you have you\nYou've players busted and we watch superhuman feats time and time again we watch the NBA and the athleticism on display and it's not you know just throwing out\nYou know allegations that any individuals and it's just the reality of won't bigger faster stronger enables you to play back to back nights and some of the Ryan that we see with such regularity I mean al ... toward all a discussion in the in the national football league just gone down the line\nBut you'll you'll get major league baseball for this now you you go through the security ... and earlier or in your past and report when the number of security from major league baseball sent for that game in anticipation of\nWhat what are we going to find more people checking the where the camera wells are every any area of the dugout hello this is going to be ...\nYou got to put it in a bucket wow you got to put it in a bucket or you go anywhere near the ... all I see what your side so you go on the other way I was like whoa you think there might be in a while there could be a wow All right I mean that\nAngle to this that takes it at all\nThat look twenty nine strike out last two games Fifteen tonight and the brewers are playing like the team that is calm cool collected\nThey're going from a to B. and B. C. and see the D and this relievers coming in here in this relievers coming in here and this is how we're playing the series they seem like the team that's in control good news is for the Dodgers that look if anybody's game right now it's one more than they win this game\nSuddenly her she was going to put 'em up three to tomorrow but\nIt's certainly this entire series up\nUntil now has been the brewer seem like they're the team that have been in the lead in control much more than the Dodgers act like you've\nBeen there and that's what the brewers are grade counsel for whatever you know you knew or are getting about the brewers team coming into the series\nYou're going to the bowl painting approach more or less you have ... starts goes out all these guys are pitched multiple games in the series effective distilled there the Dodgers hitters with Reuters and scoring position just atrocious and I'm now watch this Machado replay\nOn this ... probably about ten times he changes his gate and and a lot of jokes on Twitter in Haiti hustle down on though\nHe ... well it doesn't mean he's got to do to get them to hustle hey go spike the first baseman if you run hard down the line maybe that's all mad as well that would be a big payoff that could be a whole tactic\nAnd a boy and his legs waiting there no I [laughter] you know who the most unhappy personal world is right now Rob Manfred\nBecause he's going to actually have to do something after that but he's got two things to worry about how you got you got the ALCOA as I have a camera and ... and and finally ... Long Island oh the captain human effort is like he's he's calling a secretary outdoors yeah taking an immediate vacation for a week\nI'll be back this let me and told them it right I hang out with Adam Silver courtside about you know the warriors got the right you know the Knicks player and I I was I was the table to play [laughter]\nWell did it did stop pays the play a little bit because of all the video we have to watch and and that and I am this controversy minute oh man if you look at this many you got many chubby got spike gate and now you have a ball and you go to a major league
