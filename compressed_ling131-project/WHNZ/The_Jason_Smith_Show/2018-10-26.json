of there I have seen the violent nature of some of these people on the fringe you want to talk about rhetoric saying that we were racist because somehow we opposed healthcare where\nThe president of the United states at the time that supported that sentiment\nIf you post just policies you did so because you were a racist\nJust like if you didn't want to vote for Hillary Clinton you did you felt that way because you were a sexist it didn't matter if you were good enough to vote for her husband they'll take your vote but the second that you decided to do something differently because you're tired of being lectured to about pronouns and everything else then suddenly you magically turned into a a racist big it\nYou were raised as big as when you were voting Democrat but the moment you decided to exercise your free will and go somewhere else and you became a racist Democrats are racist and sexist that's how that went\n\nI ... and it's all of the name calling and the vitriolic language I I I was called the tea bag or to my face by people in media on television\nYou want to lecture me about tone incivility this is how Donald Trump became president because people were tired

paying\nFor their own families premiums and keeping a roof over their heads and food on their table\n\nThis has been going on for so long and now all of these individuals who in the actively engaged

it's good or bad\nWhat I'm saying is stop acting like this is something this administration invented stop acting like the amount of ridiculous news isn't disproportionate\nPolitics is always going to be polarized but people used to be able to coexistence each other as humans and not just issues\nAnd I'm going to tell you what I wasn't the one who stopped doing that I wasn't the one who ended friendships I wasn't the one who stopped talking to people because they thought differently from me or they voted differently from me or they believe things differently than I Do that wasn't me and it wasn't anybody that I Know\nSomething you don't need to do a gut check but\nI definitely do see people um I don't know there are conservative or they you know oh gosh can you all great anybody supports Trump is a racist seriously\nI'm tired of it\nBeing better is a two way street and this has been going on for over ten years\nAnd and this is exactly how Trump got elected\nI'm going to play for you some of his soundbites from the rally that he had yesterday because\nHe was condemned for even what he said yesterday\nPeople don't even and that's the thing there are people I Want you guys to realize there are people who make money off of division like media matters the Web site that was founded by the guy Daily Caller says was on ... is a staff were illegally carrying firearms in Washington DC they make money off of division\n\nThere are people who are going to protect their riches I'm not kidding you there are entire industry's on built on division these people don't want to lose their money trained so they're going to fight you on that they're they don't they want to keep dividing everybody that's what they're going for\n\nSoldiers is going to be doing buckle up to fund

Americans are passionate people\nBut at the same time we can still be a respectful people and you you you don't\nJust the stuff that we have seen you don't have to send stuff through the mail or people that brief second hour on the way we got a lot [noise] [noise]\nWhen we\nBought our free I downloaded\nContinues and says there's no evidence ... any provocative words from the president had anything to do was sending of anything\n\nAnd he goes he goes and speaking of attacks why in light of the contacts between the ... of a possible bombing spree\nIs the times asserting that Hillary Clinton and Obama and Soros have quote figure prominently and conservative political attacks have they they have not been subjected to attacks in the sense conveyed by this report they have been on the receiving end of mirror political criticism\nNot the subject of attempted political assassinations\nLike oh I don't know what Bernie Sanders supporter James Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican been nearly killed these college McCarthy says I don't recall about the time speculation about whether or not he could have been set off by Democrats urging supporters to get aggressive to quote get in their face to quote if they bring a knife we bring a gun\nWhen dealing with political adversaries he says investigators are doing their job chances are will know soon enough who's actually responsible for this and then we won't need speculation about motive and incitement though there will be no shortage of it anyway and he's right\n\nI mean you want to talk about rhetoric [noise]\nWhat about the attempted assassination at Family Research council you know I spoke with their um their event the value voters event just what a month ago and D.C wet of extra security and they told us not to even go outside because they had been threatened again somebody is that all they're all in one place when I should just go in there\n\n... went off of Southern Poverty Law Center is hate list and this is over chick fillet remember and only because Family Research council or just you're you're there your everyday Christians\nBut because they are organized and they have events and they can move vote they get targeted and they get treated as something more right and so ... went on Southern Poverty Law Center is website solved the map of hate groups which ... Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate\nGroup they are a hate group\nAnd went on their website saw that Family Research council was listed so he went up shot up the lobby and was he had he brought a bunch of chick fillet sandwiches with him because he was going to murder a bunch of people and shove the sandwiches in their gaping mouths after they had expired when he murdered them\nThat was his plan and uh he was I mean we couldn't nobody said at the time he was completely motivated by leftist rhetoric\nOver chick fillet Democrat rhetoric over chick fillet remember when Bloomberg said oh there are values aren't our values were remember when Romney manuals that they're not welcome in Chicago I mean nobody said that Ron an annual Michael Bloomberg we're responsible for the lead up to that attempted assassination where they\nDid anybody said that did anybody influential on the right to say that it was Democrats that were responsible for the rhetoric that inspired a Bernie bros staffer to go and shoot up a ball field in almost assassinate the heat trapping attempted assassination animals murdered Steve ...\nWhat about all the rice and stuff that's been sent out just over the past couple of weeks\n\nHere yet Maxine Waters it said make them feel uncomfortable wherever they are Hillary Clinton saying that we're not going to be civil until we win the White House or you've had numerous individuals' yet yeah ... yeah exactly Eric Holder just kick 'em all kinds of stuff\n\nI mean if you want to have a discussion about rhetoric okay\n\nWhat a bomb was president he said stuff while you're food brand knife you bring a gun like this\nThis rhetoric from the west has been going on in the media is overlooked it and then when there's perceived rhetoric on the right or some perception that some rhetoric may have caused them if they exaggerate it on the right like it's nobody's been mhm it's a double standard him it's become more clear today that over\nYeah and they and it and everyone wants to pretend that that somehow this is\nUh that that it's somehow I'm\nAll started with Trump and it didn't differ are seething was way before Trump I mean\nNot even close this has been going on for a long time that's why it's really it's\nWhy I I I um I I I Can't take seriously\nWhen people in the media say you need to watch her rhetoric and we need to be more civil\nIn our tone and more unifying and also by the way Trump is responsible for all the bombings\nI just kind of have a problem with that because it's completely\nHypocritical it's I it's entirely it cancels itself out you can't sit here and say that you want more unity and more civility while simultaneously running stories like the New York times did where are you read it they rented extra yesterday an author writing about the assassination of Trump\n\nWorld I read some of it at the top of the show the world so how do you I mean how how\nMy friend John Davis reminds he goes yeah he goes please dearest media as he includes a picture of the Boston bombers that was put on the cover of Rolling Stone like he was Jim Morrison he goes pleased bears media tell us more about who's culpable for incentivizing or glamorizing political violence\n\nOr what about in Chicago magazine put bill air standing on a flag on their cover\nI mean we didn't go on and on [noise]\nIt didn't start it did not start there\nIt did not start there and here's the thing\nYou would be very very easy for this to de escalate\nI mean honestly you had Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi that were they issued a statement yesterday were and they bashed Trump and basically blamed him while they're also saying we need to be civil you can't say we need civility while blaming somebody for something that it did not support it at all\nYou don't get because if you're going to go by your logic then we need to arrest you guys for the congressional they attempted assassination of congressman\nHow far do you want to go with it people come to your senses\nOkay so I Want to switch it up oh I Know one Claire McCaskill has basically alienated all of the Democrats right now in Missouri we are going to talk about this because she came out with this insane ad where she says I'm not one of those crazy Democrats\nAnd all these Democrats in Missouri are going what do\nWe need to talk about that because it was pretty crazy [laughter] they're really really mad [noise]\nUh and then we're going to also going to have a and we'll take it when it happens a and a press conference I'm coming up about the latest on the bomb investigation so we'll have that for you as well [noise]\nCal Tech makes it easy to exercise your to a rights because they make some fun stuff they just when when you when you like what you're shooting you like the quality of it and it's fun and and and you just it's just you'd want to use it more I like taking my stuff to the range or and or you know it can shoot\nRight and left handed I like the fact that assembled extras like they're already be\nA and they had the ... the cash tactical shock on line one of my favorite things to go and take to the range not just also because it looks cool but the debt depended ... clear so you don't have to worry about stuff wind up in your line of sight and this is um\nIt's BS third conclusion is be so I'm not saying whatever they did and regard and your conclusion is BS because you think owners are not innocent I well first of all that's a whole separate issue old people not being innocent completely separate from this particular story button these old people I Believe are not available as young beautiful\nBut they're trying to do their the results of their quote unquote studying to say that young people are less likely to believe that the old people and um [noise] that's really not the so I don't believe that that's I called the Supplemental Nutrition and also for you [noise]\nHomelessness is exploding on the coast was not possible because it's totally utopia over there they have all the Democrat policies\nOr accept more than ... million yeah more than half a million Americans are homeless right now one of the average for Americans has a job but rapidly increasing housing prices especially on the coast have made it really pot impossible for people to find a place to live so\nThere are thousands of people that I remember when we were in Santa Barbara and I cannot believe the number of homeless people that work in Santa Barbara\nThey had nowhere to go and they would put up these games on the boardwalk seats down the boardwalk and for like if you gave the money you could play one of the games that they had set up there [noise] it was interesting yeah I\nIn Los Angeles they say homelessness is up in by

underestimate the difference even one person can make\nGeorge or collective safety and neither should the people of New York city ... reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do every time we talk about for reaching investigations of this nature or any other kind of nothing we do and law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joy ... to ... to professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great pursuits\nAnd that can say with certainty that we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nNew York city's intelligence and counterterrorism counterterrorism capabilities are second and not every day they are not just this week our detectives and analysts are constantly poring over that stretch dream as we proactively deploy or resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today to add up in abundance of caution I'll tell you that when we look at the events have yesterday and today I have a match pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD reaching everyday especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nI'll conclude by reminding everyone that law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the publicly serve safe that's\nIt that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and willing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city will make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor\nThank you very much commissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job\nYesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nOr to address this forthrightly now a look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on prominent public figures\nOr we're going to make sure there's expanded presence as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending\nPeople who are coming under attack that part of how we protect to the Democratic process is to show the threats like this not taken lightly so that they expect that presidents and I know that for those who have gone through this uh in the last few days that the president said they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that uh everyday New Yorkers have responded to this situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that this city is famous for that makes me very very proud of all eight point six million New Yorkers as they have handled the situation\nA with a real sense of resolve a they're not going to let an act of terror\nIntimidate them and that's a really important in this moment to say whatever the motives of the individuals involved\nAh the people of this city or are not being thrown off the game or not having their values undermined or the way of life undermined New Yorkers are standing strong right now\nIn the last thing I Want to say is you know it in a moment like this there's a lot of concern there's a lot of fear\nAre clearly it's upsetting time it's a time when there's been too much hatred and too much division in the air\nAnd in that context people can feel powerless I Want to remind people that everyone has an opportunity to play a positive and constructive role here\nUh first of all helping law enforcement this is something that everyone can do if you have any information at all that you think could help law enforcement to address the situation share it with law enforcement immediately\nI'll let them be the judges of the value of the information don't hold back\nAre so many times and I agree with the commissioner of law enforcement that ultimately has proven they will find the perpetrators but so many times it's because uh an individual citizen step forward with information that really led to the key breakthrough you have information sharing\nIf you're concerned about uh packages that could arrive at your home or your workplace you see something that worries you reach out to the police get their involvement to address the situation\nA program called the nexus program we have the shield program so we have a lot of built in um\nPre set a public private outraged that we just turned on and then turned up\nUh we went to a television networks yesterday we posted a police officers in front of locations that we thought might be under increased threat\nOr when the bomb or when the device was discovered that the at CNN NYPD personnel were already there are working with their mail room people on a recognition and detection and that was um increased a to a wider scope today I don't want to go through 'em\nWhat types of people or places uh we've increased too because we don't want to single anybody out of that hasn't received a package

the Knicks hey you're going to the next hey you go to the next ... what Lauren Miller obviously\nIs a pretty cool dude came on the show they called you ran for a hundred and thirty orange Texans just one and at the end I said goodbye to him in a in kind of a different way and this is how the\nEnd of the conversation when a case you're just tuning in Mr interview with Lamar Miller he said he had to watch the Andre Hopkins catch on the jumbotron that turned out to get overturned because a penalty because he couldn't believe the catchy made talked about how legit the Texans are they got to keep working 'cause it was hard work that got him to this point\nAnd then I said goodbye to Lamar Miller like lists or keep on keep it out man we'll talk later\nOkay\nAnd you don't you don't walk away Lamar how's your mom doing [laughter] why you would have got his answer his answer was cool All right man there was no editor it was no although he know ended up\nAll do you I'm helping your case I took it out your when you know in my case there was not good when he said you know you don't mind we jump what he said why he just said All right man cool and I was that was you know\nI don't think he did he say what\nThat was the equivalent of one of those ... like when you put your arm around a guy you know that's about ... and you you you got the back of a shoulder\nWith your fist I Hope it was shoulder yeah that will go I was wrong but I'm I'm a boom keep on keep an eye on what the answer back at you you know\nYou can do and they got to tell the whole story you can't just Celeste stories already going you definitely would have held his hands for at least by the ... not only what he's not even we're joined by Curtis Martin at least I don't think so they only what held Curtis Martin's and it was going to help\nYou I think that if I don't know I think he has a and what are you talking about [laughter]\nI still have some occurs Martin's callous to save those books somewhere I don't doubt it [laughter] look I'm Sorry that I'm just cooler than all of you put together or I mean I Am I just that uh I mean I look I'm forty seven but I could play twenty\nAll what the pulled aside I mean I Will decide because it's not a skier although we do not want that yes or a hell no ... yeah ...\nHow old do is skew that's that's giving people know it's not this one you may want to sign that says ... know\nI mean I could have made that the Florida hold an arrow in front of the poll is starting to come back to me a little bit it's coming back to also now it's legit yes all already a Logan sweets and Joe Dirt always said it so you know it's got to be cool\nWell he does have a point there I Do dirt Jay do your job there so now you have to grow up ... ... no I don't well I Wish that Roger said keep on keep it on his hip as studio fifty four Ninety Seventy two thanks rod shows what you know studio fifty four was until like Seventy seven thirty eight\n... a little truth roller comes back with no that was meant to just over to keep on keep an eye\n[laughter] what does that mean keep on keep an eye man will do what I mean\nUh my says keep on keep it all works fine and dilute minister\nMorgan said I think it's cool that has a nice ring to it it's got a great beat and I can a buck I don't really like like how you look right now if it's split that's fine because you have it skewed so much that I Am\nIn ... if this poll being split like this it's so skewed that it's like me winning by a landslide how do you mean it's skewed because you put ...\nSo how about a fresco just use the phrase keep on keep an eye during our interview with Miller time six job yeah is it hit\nI Can't believe they haven't done it because first round picks are absolute\nGold not that every guy they get is going to be a great player because some of those first round picks are going to be lower in the first round 'cause you think the rockets are going to be good the next couple of years but\nHey they could take a dive any time we thought the Lakers are going to be great oh first round picture Steve Nash oh you're kidding and out of that trade go down it hurt the Lakers for five years\nBecause they traded away first round picks it's not just about first round pick that you are getting\nThat are going to be great for you but it's about getting the extra first round picks that you can trade up\nTo package hey we're going to give you are picking Eighteen and and and Twenty one and move up to ten we're going to give you were going to get our picks at sixteen and nine and move up to five whatever it is\nIt's valuable it's also valuable in trades because teams won first round picks there's plenty of teams that have players that are really good but you don't run the hook with a little bit too much money for them we want to move on and they might be players who are really desirable the other teams but\nWhat can they give up the seems one first round picks salary first great great great great great will take the Celtic the guy will take the first round ...\nHaving a first round pick is so valuable and you want to give up for them you will torpedo the future of your franchise and the rockets no doubt to me are panicking\nAt the early fought in the western conference of so many teams that we thought we are going to be just okay that are actually looking legit\nThe nuggets are legit the pelicans look like they might be a legit the Lakers added the best player in the game the warriors are still the warriors this is a panic situation from the rocket through thick hey we better go out and try to get somebody because all of these teams may pass us\nPortland may wind up being really really good this is how it goes we can't get past a complete panic offer this is by the rock well certainly can't be\nComplacent and obviously you're still wondering how long the injury to James Harden will impact\nThe roster how much time he misses and whether that lingers as the season goes on but you know you had the muddled middle right it was it was two\nTwo teams at the top the warriors in the rockets and three through nine you didn't have a lot of separation then she'd chew more teams just on the outside looking in we thought the war and it could be\nUm the pelicans I should say could be solid but clearly they've got six or seven deep good double digits every night so that makes it interesting Lakers as we watch them\nFinishing the job here a fast break points against Denver a it's fun but you you're talking about first first round picks you want to have chips to build your a ship team right\nYour team for the shit I bill you you're not building them you're taking chips to build towards the ship and I work at an organ a patent that we're going to make a big deal out of it it's going to kind of workforce but certainly you're you're trying to add assets and low cost assets\nThat particularly if you get back into those together uh and that in watching John group and trying to figure out how to navigate that now on the other side and the NFL are accumulating them and then a question of can you can you catch those in for guys that are impact players\nThe MBA with Jimmy Butler already at twenty nine Chris ... thirty five harden right about that age where with\nWith a Jimmy Butler as well that the window for this particular team isn't very long so now\nHow how quickly do you have to turn that Ross rover so it does a legitimate offer you take the form picks and you move on\nI mean as you might still listen to one that's already saw it I mean you're really going to say we need a player too I mean I Know and and\nBut I think that's it if you're looking short term you're not getting the ... you know initial\nRush because you're not getting a top ten or Fifteen player but we know in that in the latter years as this team ages out and shovels over that made me those become highly highly prized and prize picks up towards the top of that first round\nFox Sports radio the Jason Smith show with my business friend my Carmen for\nFirst round pegs I don't know why the Tim rules haven't said yeah the other judges yes yes yes\n[laughter] we don't

[noise] download it now [noise]\nBut then and then then the suspensions happened and we found out that ... what was going to start and Alonzo bowl was going to start we said this Monday Night\nThis could be a silver lining opportunity for the Lakers because now they're going to get a chance to start lines though to see if launch those game matches well with LeBron's can launch zone knock down some shots we know it we know is somebody that can that can\nGet the ball up and down the floor phenomenal court vision but Kenny knocked down a few shots can he get the ball to LeBron James where LeBron needs it for most of the shot clock and Lorenzo doesn't\n... can ... be the shot maker that LeBron James needs because now the team is built differently\nAnd the team is built around the bronze and LeBron needs his guys we heard this before the season he wants his players to have the specific roles 'cause this is what a succeeded for him when he knows what he can get from every guy on the floor at every second of the game and\nHe is\nAbsolutely the guy you have to change the team around to make that happen and look where you are now after three games\nLosing Ron do for\nThe suspension and losing Ingram ... you cannot deny his chemistry with LeBron on the floor LeBron is finding him he knows where to be already he's only started three games with the brought them abroad is looking for him all the time Lorenzo is knocking down shots just have to knock down a lot\nHe scored twelve tonight that's fine if he's five out of ten he scores twelve these two out of five from three point range that's all they need from Lorenzo he also dished out eight assists five steel six rebounds you get that from Lorenzo\nAnd I know how talented brand and ... and I know they brought in a rage on Rhonda but when these guys come back\nThey have to go to the bench because this is the Laker lineup that is doing the most damage with these guys starting oh by the way don't forget about Josh hearts starting\nTwelve points tonight five rebounds and says he's given them what they need out of shooting guard even though he didn't have a great night shooting but he clearly as earn this chance this clearly is the most dangerous Laker lined up because they're scoring twenty more points again that is the first couple of games with the season\nSo this is where it's got to go in a brand new anger becomes the main catalysts behind the second unit then that's what they got to do because that's what's going to be what's best for the Lakers and oh by the way now don't I haven't even mentioned you got to add in\nMaybe what KCPT can do and last Stevenson off the bench he had twelve tonight he's training of the top of twitters he was dancing after a big pastor who is my first don't get a big passed all abroad for a dunk and suddenly land Stevenson is now the happiest guy in the world\nAnd LeBron has these cast the guys that no longer look like a abroad and a bunch of spare parts they look bleeping dangerous this looks like a dangerous team and all you got to do\nIs look and say\nOh boy make 'em Dan ... is trending because of the dancey had after that'll that'll coming up and sing and this tells you where the excitement level is the Lakers\nRight they uh the floor or takes the chair away from them Jason Smith\nA and his monologue about the greatness of LeBron James and the Lakers are it is certainly a different line up a ... and different explosive this\nTo this unit or and then we saw the first couple of games that obviously there's always going to be a feeling out period each year overhaul the almost the entire roster you brought in what was called the land of misfit toys by many people here in the LA market and you look around and yet\nWhat ... six players in double figures and then Cold War pope had eight\nSo you're you're getting balance score and you're doing getting a lot of fast break points and and that's the one thing in the excitement level and you get the the home crowd rock in and everybody's excited\nKobe Bryant shut up a few times over the course of this game watching some of the fast break opportunities ... good spot of shoes you got Lorenzo ball with the confidence nobody's going to get spacing not because he can't shoot up because they've got a collapse on either ... or LeBron James he had to step back three that is one of the highlights\nComing out of this game and in each whatever's in social media say look that's a confidence he didn't have in that shot even it's\nShot the bad shot just inside the two point lead inside the three point line last year now he's stepping back and said All right with complex I'm letting it launched so now you got that value coming to it and it's a wide open game and obviously LeBron James is going to pick the four guys he wants to run with\nBut I gotta think after these this game auditioned you're feeling pretty good about it and now it's just anger um Enron do an ego management and that's what The Waltons getting paid for you gotta know figure out and make sure that they're cool ah with what their roles will be and I got to think if I'm Brandon Ingram I got an opportunity to be the guy with the brawn James takes a breather\nFor eight minutes at a time here and there as long as my teams good nuts\nLet him take a a a bull rest yeah there's a lot of scoring opportunities and a lot of greatness to flow out of that so I think there'll be just fine\nTwitter at ... am on a fresco Mike is swollen DOMA Jason Smith show with my business friend my car but I mean renting it was

fuller is a big deal and it would be a different kind of guy but you wonder\nIf someone like that is Brian someone that's going to go visit the Texans now are they going to now make a move for a wide receiver plenty of guys are available you know what I'd love to see go bold called the giants say yeah what do you want for oh don't\nLook at you what do you want for oh Dell what do you want what do you want will take them off your hands what do you want and make curious to see\nWhat the ah the Texans cat numbers and whether they can make that work\nAnd they go out to be a lot of creativity but certainly does Bryant was interested in ... he was tweeting out about some of the the Andre Hopkins catches mhm so it certainly he's a well well aware of what other receivers are doing and what teams are are looking for a and you got to think what the trade deadline coming up\nIf you've got ... opportunities here for for deals to be made we talked with Jason lock in for a earlier in the show about a number of maybe secondary and tertiary players on you know defensive or off ... secondary moves but certainly for a wide receivers\nNow you've got to be looking if you're a Houston you got a nice tight and finding Thomas in the red zone but now you need another guy\nTo help you stretch the field right now that is lacking of for your Houston Texans\nAnd look let me just talk about the laundry Hopkins for a second here because he you know I said this year I gave you my boat production he was going to be the number one receiver in the NFL looks like he's gonna he's got a lot of work to do to pass out I'm feeling who was just a machine with a hundred and thirty hours a week and everything else\nAnd it's always about a hundred and fifty yards behind but you look where he is certainly can pass Julio Jones\nHe is just so free casually talented and it's not just about\nThe catchy made tonight they've gotten the gated for a pass interference penalty he made that catch that was an old out back on the left hand up pulling it down and really kind of put a hold it behind his leg and credit with his right hand it was amazing\nI mean the ... we had Lamar Miller on the show earlier and you'll hear some of that interview coming up next we have um our Miller on it and and he said I watch them on the on the scoreboard the diamond vision because I couldn't believe it was such a great
