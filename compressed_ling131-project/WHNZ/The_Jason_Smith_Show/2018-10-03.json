are there any other way when you're sick and beat the number but\nShaw getting bumped again to for review is only one of the crazy stories of the day as we talk about the major league baseball playoffs\nThe Ames and the Yankees who will be going out of tomorrow night me AOL wild card game you're going to see something a little different this is because the A's are going to make their game a bullpen game Bob Melvin\nToday at the press conference for the wild card game had Liam endurance out because he's going to start the game or a lever\nWho may pitch one inning he may pitch to weddings doesn't matter but it will be quote a bullpen game\nFor the ages they're going to use as many relievers as they can or maybe starting pitchers as relievers but that's how the game is going to go Melvin did not give anything else out about his rotation you could wind up seeing Hendricks pitch the fertilizers at first inning pursue innings they could go to another starting pitcher\nThey could go to another relief pitcher but that's how they're going to treat this game against the Yankees the Yankees go with Louis ever arena\nI Love this strategy I Know it sounds crazy and it sounds outside the box and it's something that we kind of talked about in jest for a while but if you don't have good starters ... dump their best started was showing me who's now out for the year he here to shoulder a couple of weeks ago\nThey don't have anybody they can say okay we're going to throw you out there and think that we get an even match up with the Yankees so we're going to do instead is we're going to go and make it a bullpen game because I'm going to put the pictures I have the most confidence in out there to pitch\nAnd it makes complete sense and I'll tell you what\nEventually a team is going to have some kind of saber metric breakthrough in they're going to have a manager that's going to say here's what I'm doing I'm taking Thirteen pitchers\nAnd I'm going to go with all relief pitchers and every day is going to be a bullpen game and I'm going to have three or four guys pitching one day and then three or four guys pitching the next day three or four guys pitching the day after that guys that can go two or three and I'm not saying they're going to go you know five and the guys are going to go\nTwo or three days and that's going to be the rotation and pitches are going to have two days between games relievers left two days between games to pitch\nAnd you can certainly moved guys up and down hey we need a fresh arm from AAA to come up to pitch this game whatever you're going to see that eventually it teams are going to go you know what that's what we're going to compete we're going to sign a bunch of good relievers\nAnd that's how we're gonna go we're gonna have guys like and I just say this because it's the Mets because I Am familiar with the guys guys like set flew on Robert dissolve and who were starters turn relievers that it's pretty well that could pitch two or three in it\nYou know and then they come out because then you're you're effect of this kind of goes away or you will see a team decide you know what yes you're my starter but one time through the order\nYou're out and bring in somebody from the bullpen because really what are you doing\nYou're just going to say okay I haven't you go another\nTime and a half through the order and in the sixth inning and bringing reliever anyway ... you're going to go to the order one time than another guy's coming in to go through the order one time and that\nAnd that's we're going to do you're going to somebody will do that at some point and it's going to revolutionize baseball yes we've seen the rays do it a little bit this year but somebody's going to do with this is going to your plan for the season yeah but I think a lot of\nIt isn't going to be necessarily the saber metrics on it which is a nice a residual effect I think you're going to have more teams like the raise looking at it from just a pure cost perspective\nRight now it's more cost efficient to have a bunch of middle reliever it's not that they're\nCheap like they were ... years ago but still compared to starting pitcher salaries we brought up the the number of thirty three million that you're looking at for a clean shot by no means do I compare one the other as a one to one but that's one slot in your rotation versus half a bull pen [laughter]\nYou're going for and I know that money can be spent ... and that's one of those things where at the age go after it here is you only want to see the hitters to see a pitcher once\nAnd that's it move on you got the most prolific home run hitting outfit that we've ever seen in major league baseball a veritable conga line dancing around the base pat how do you slow it down keep them on their heels keep bringing in different arms defend all angles change it up speed however you can do it and that's ... bay dismissed direction\nFor the uh baseball mound is basically what we're going to see them or I Can't wait to see how it comes to fruition quite long haul shore I can totally see a team saying we've got Ninety million dollars a barrel you know what we can get\nTwelve pictures for X amount and now we can actually afford a couple of hitters and we'll see if the sociological experiment works see I like\nAbout this thing about what the Dodgers are paying Clayton Kurdish are right now between thirty and thirty two million dollars a year right I mean that's a lot of money you could conceive\nOf every dollar by the window [laughter] how does the measure up to Keenan Allen yeah but he's the third best picture on the Dodgers now prosper you know that's not true [laughter] you know you lie on three eighty oh who's you're on the having a big game right now are you at home Walker you know it's a you know you give her saw the ball\nHitter you taking out your second best hit both teams you take it out your best to your second best that I it it's just insane\nI really it's absolutely insane but we get to the top of the eleventh inning and I'll tell you what it's been entertaining\nIt's likely Kevin Bacon citizen a few good men he'll cut to do a few officers will throw around terms like go run I'll tell you he'll have no evidence mind you know I bought it will be entertaining and that's kind of where we're at right now we've had horrible replay reviews that didn't go right out guys out of games it's entertaining and they're saying well at this point Madden\nProven right by the ... right takes about for the pinch runner and and they get the run home oh I'd almost back fired when you've got Murphy potentially butchering the ball at first\nBase but everybody got out unscathed and we keep moving on to the top of the yellow a meanwhile\nIt's been two days it's man it's it's been it's been two days to the United states lost the Ryder Cup yeah and they really put up a fight to tell you what it looked good for the first half of day one\nKind of like the jets we look good for the first half of the first half of that they look good for the first half of day one does\nGeez I remember a Robert and in a it was introduced to just go fantasy talk uh with Joe to dodge Saturday and Sunday before my fantasy shoebox we're both fantasy with Dan Meyer six am Pacific not a I'm a nice uh and I was all excited saying this is going to Trump all all football stories I looked at again\nYou're out of your mind [laughter] it's like come on like even if they what it's like beating the NFL what I'd give you that there'd be more interest and then they they lay down but the\nStories coming off the Ryder Cup Patrick greed who is the big villain on the PGA Tour or said he was very upset to be taken off a paring with Jordan speech because they were so successful Ryder Cup presidents cup\nAnd there were rumors that speech asked out of the pairing because he didn't like Patrick greed Patrick read was really upset said Jim Europe didn't captain very well today on identify player said Patrick reads full of crap he begged to play with Tiger Woods and Jim ... wouldn't do it and then we get this story on the heels of Patrick recalls and all this controversy\nThat Dustin Johnson and Brooks kept good nearly got into a\nFist fight over there and play on Saturday\n[noise] we we got golfers wanting to white each other or with that I was an overt pointing a Gretzky I well it could have been ... by you throw fits for that right I I you you got it All right yeah yeah but I like to think this is limited to the to the Ryder Cup are you sure I Know but I I okay I'm Seventy five percent okay that's good enough [laughter]\nI mean it just doesn't get any better than than a leap golfer millionaires who want to fight doesn't get any better than ... why not\nI mean everybody's got a little fighting in once in a while\nAll right I'll tell you this I'll tell you the speaking a fight about love or not ... than anything else but sure\nWith all of this going yeah here's the golfers I wouldn't fight right I wouldn't quite Brooks kept are doing the guide\nAny of you know one guy with a specially now you see Phil Mickelson swinging his leg over the top yeah he was a bottle of nail scissors kick you in the back of the head you know\nWe've got a problem I wouldn't buy ... obviously the guys back I mean he's been doing that slow play with those commercials and then he's all flexible and get your head I wouldn't fight still true because you they all feel no bill is tall and he's big\nAnd I I think bill could just like fall on me I think by ... you would have pyramid scheme then you have you with a pyramid scheme and all the way to go your cash already [laughter]\nVaporize you with his leg I wouldn't fight\nPatrick read because he would fight dirty there's no way I Would fight there is no I'd fight Patrick ... I wouldn't fight Dustin Johnson because he'd be crazy and unpredictable he'd he'd like do stuff that like phone with the mouth I Would do what the hell's going on coke yeah oh I Would fight Rory McIlroy because the only way daughter and sixty pounds I could easily get a ...\nYou know and I'm like you're a good off that's why I'm sure and I like Tiger Woods you by tiger you know why because he would be more worried about losing and protecting himself that he would be getting out there being a like\nA back yeah she I'd be going on in trying to get them into the lectures Lugar torture rack

tell you who is safer out that's why nobody left their position\nThe players will tell you who is safe or out and that was a that's why it was a horrible call by the umpires and go back and overlooked that now again\nThis play now plays into this replay play plays into what happened last night between the chiefs and the Broncos not throwing the flag on the cheese for the delay of game penalty\nCertainly that play being allowed to stand gave the chiefs a huge advantage is now first down inside the twenty yard line\nBut if they did get called it would be Thirteen twelve from fifty which still two minutes left to go on the game there's still a lot of game left you don't know what would have happened it would have been a different game but the point is to get the call right the same thing here tonight\nIf not call was allowed to stand ... at second base with two outs next about a could pop up ground out certainly it's not like balls are flying out originally tonight runs around a premium\nBut the thing is getting the call right and be able to explain yes this is why we did it X Y Z and I'm not I don't see that anywhere from this so far can't wait to see what\nThe explanation is in the post when we get it from the pool reporter always pull reporters all at once you get to the playoffs whether it'd be major league baseball or the NHL NBA and certainly a\nMajor league baseball and they will will get the pool reporter notes I mean we always get that from the super bowl you always get oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because it's a big honor to be named pool report\nThat got to go out and things are always said noticed this came out from a pool reporter it's like oh my God this is this is the best way he's got an extra access you know ... you know it's

continued free baseball\nSo while we keep an eye on this cubs with runners at first and second one out bottom of the eleventh I hit would win the game for the cubs\nThe Dodgers make an interesting decision\nFor game one of the LDS it will not be Clayton Kurt shot throwing in game one a shocker it will be young general you going in game one against the Braves her shovel pitching game to both pitchers will get their normal rest if they want to go in game five\nSo Dave Roberts has made a really gutsy decision and it's not gonna sit well\nBut quite honestly it's the right decision\nNow for the straight rotational perspective uh it gets real working both guys will pitch on one day extra rats whereas if you walk them then you'd be looking at two days rest for review and\nIt'll be normal wrestler parish yeah but this is why this is the right move\nThe Dodgers have relied on Clinton courage Sean every post season for the last six years and certainly is not his fault that gets me all they all lost you got but it's not like Clinton ... has been regular season plate and Kirsch will they ever lied on him to pitch twice in a series when ... maybe come back on three days rest and it hasn't worked\nSometimes things are as simple as you know what\nHas it worked six years so let's try something new\nAnd this gets the Dodgers away from relying on Clinton curse you ought to win games it gets away from the mentally relying on Clinton ... it gets away from other teams thinking if we can be ... we can beat the Dodgers we were moving downhill if we bicker Sean game one\nThis is not the season the curse jaws had in the past you can argue he is the third best picture on the team right now\nBehind Walker bealer behind ... pitching it home it's a big deal for you pitching at home where if you're a is one point one five for the season but this is the beginning of the Dodgers and this is Dave Roberts realizing we can't keep relying on you we tried for so long\nAnd I mean when I said there's a lot and the last Eighteen months instead of the few times tonight\nIf the Dodgers had a future without Clinton ... it's okay if you opt out after this year and goes to pitch in Texas was someplace else the Dodgers will be fine without him they blitz to the world series last year and he missed a long period of time in the middle of the season they one Ninety two games the ... this year and he was just\nHe was good he wasn't great they will be fine without Clinton crush of who's over thirty with back problems if this is the beginning of the divorce of of the moving away this be the official\nPoint where you could say okay the Dodgers are contemplating a life without him they will find life without him is going to be okay but not like\nYears passed you actually have people that started that rotation making step in\nYou look at what review as done\nOr on the road at three five eighty eighty IRA but it at home and nine starts absolutely dominant and huge in the month of September and then you look at Walker Mueller who is a star ready to dominate we watched it the last couple of months\nWondering about his innings usage at this point does it matter he's full on and

of the game meanwhile the Rockies on their picture of the game but again we're still won one\nIn the twelfth thinning the Rockies bullpen starting to get a little bit low but not quite as low as the ... by your salivating\nIf you're the brewers are and I know there's a lot of shout outs going across social media to uh people from Denver light that are covered Monday Night football Saturday and then had to get to Chicago and it didn't say they probably running out a lot of coffee\nIt's absolutely insane and you know what it will get you in a few minutes we'll get to the most nervous man a nervous sports\nPersonality in the is it me but no it's not like I got a lot of those but as we've said this game has been full of everything you would want in a in a wild card game you had\nA questionable managerial decisions Charlie Black men coming out of this game you've had controversy with instant replay or you've had an incredible at bat my hobby by as\nYou know you have by as housing goes ... move or move you know what good let's get to that one for a minute don't you're buying second quarter back in in in the old adage that you're going to a lot I mean\nYou just stop or momentum and give them a big hug and telling you love the art he breaks up a possible double play ah gets forced out at third base he and our NATO end up ... well or not it would give it up on the plate basically bracing for impact and\nAnd so folks were looking for interference I I thought it was curious where we didn't live action going All right\nThen [laughter] yeah it's a ground ball the third and I do get sick and biases come and get any stops because he wants to force are not attack him too so we can't get a double play he stops or NATO tags and biased kinda hugs him\nAnd the Rockies but black came out and wanted runner interference I think he may have had a case if our NATO tried to get out by it and make a few\nI didn't we know the hug you and get to know how you want to go up and okay we're going to all and he's ... yeah that that you're not going to get back I mean it was a nice tender moment in the middle of a playoff game yeah\nWell I I I think they left a lot of people here I Am All right well how you get out the eleven I'm all for tender moments in a play it wasn't nice tender moment\nI mean I I think everybody in the in the crowd there regularly they should've played something nice on the Oregon and just said All right let's let's all out of ...\nYeah but that's something that I can completely understand why that is not going to be call right because that if you got to make a move you gotta make okay well I don't know yeah\nYou don't see the arm come up and the smile and auto right initially like wow that was kind of odd yeah so then\nThat's one controversy that I think you'd be it'll die pretty bought the terror the\nMiss call at second base or a replay called that really needs to be explained even though it may not have may not have ended up having a huge impact on the game\nIt's something that needs to be addressed because you want to get calls right because that's the most important thing is getting it right uh we are going to the thirteenth ... Chris Bryant he just walked on a full count pitch the terrible ... that was a little bit outside but it was framed well\nIn Shawshank yeah if you come this far perhaps you're willing to go a little bit first okay here you've gotten to the thirteenth shut up I was going to go oh it's a base up the mantle\nOh the Rockies take two to one lead Tony alters comes up about ... big knock out the metal\nThe Rockies lead it two to one Kyle energy has given up three straight hits here the top of the third seat and the Iraqis still have runners at the corners Trevor Story scores to give the Rockies the lead life goes by so fast\nYou only want to do what you think is right close your eyes was that and it's passed\nWait wait story of my life in this game CJ\nAre no good was that don't they shut it might have been ready to ban\nThat would have been a good a good day maybe a little leery Walker welcome back of the day but yeah we really didn't react to that one very well yeah I hit back up the box or the first it was a Dutch door down the left field line second one so it's a writer what a big hit them and I am a big hit right back up the box\nSo Yuri curiosity is down this plays out and you know certainly got bans gets a\nWell they got silence in a hurry still a capacity crowd on and nobody leaving the ballpark that that's what's good for them a lot of sick days or tomorrow across the great city of Chicago a but for the moments chaos ensuing at Wrigley\nField at the same people who say oh do I stay up now or do I go to bed obviously now you stay up because the game could add but it's the same people who go to a bar and after like eight drinks and it's midnight they go\nOff I got to make a decision do I go home and go to bed I got to get up early or do I just keep drinking and hanging out now that I don't know what to do I got I got to make that decision stay air eight in you know you're done what do you want your committed you're committed at this point you're committed\nA show while the most nervous people in the world continue to be cubs fans is now the Rockies have the leading they're still battling in the top of the Thirteen\nThe most nervous person in the world of sports\nIs Yankee manager Aaron both\nBecause we're the first time all year he has had to make a decision for the Yankees I could have managed the Yankees all season long the guy had zero carbon footprint on the New York Yankees puts up a light up\nThe only controversy had was oh uh Gary said just isn't hustling let's put it on the deal for a month great that works out great\nHe has had to make no decisions just put out a line up and he's been silent is that nothing to do now finally he had to decide what to do for the wild card game who to start was going to be Severino was it could be Jay ... was going to be a naka\nAnd he goes with Severino this was the safe call because at the end if the Yankees lose he could say well Severino is our best pitcher all season long or no he was your best picture the first three months of the season he has not been that good the last three months\nHe had a decent last two storage which are late season no pressure because the Yankees already had things clinched\nJay half was your best starter that to everybody in New York once that's all the back page say it's a no brainer back page all the paper that's got to be J hats\nAnd now Aaron Boone stands up and says Louis Severino I Can't wait to see how this plays out tomorrow he is so nervous right now the sweat is pouring off like he's in a pool right now he's so this is the first thing I've ever had to do all the the law managing the Yankees\nBy the hope was that the ... home runs would continue or in render all this loop but we'll see how the AIDS strategy of the bullpen work uh instead of going traditional starter a plays out on the other side but certainly for Aaron Boone the Severino pick a a little bit of a loyal\nThe to the overall success that he had for the year as opposed to just looking down the barrel and seeing what Jay happens done since arriving\nYour your he's been nothing short a phenomenal are in each of these outings so\nHow do you like

... game too I mean this is where the cubs need to score runs so the big question here is that now you have seen the cubs go from World series\nDidn't get quite as far and now they're out in the wild card round how much change do you expect to see on this cubs team in the offseason offensively they've not been able to score and certainly pitching would not the team it used to be but I think you're\nYou see some big time change in Chicago for a different mix the guys just not like the cubs are trending up and I know you could say well it's you know it's two games yeah but they had two

wondering if he had already set in before you hit them out so you got a that question in the back end of that rotation certainly going to be shuttled\nAnd a lot of the bullpen parts that have to look at the contractual status of a lot of the principles but I imagine you know you're you're also looking at a year where you miss Chris Brian for a good chunk of time reserve missed some time to injury a short we're probably says goodbye\nOr the ... they probably shouldn't we goodbye to each day I doubt I as you go a must be ... to get right we talked about the two rounds and twenty joining sixteen strike out tonight\nNot even able to put the ball and play including striking out is\nBy the side or without more going down as the final out\nBut sixteen strike at forty three of bats that are not even put the ball and play and it just fundamental baseball you know we'd be lamented to a degree the three outcome at bat all year long here's another great example of it right here uh and almost enough to get into the next round of the playoffs\nTony Walters got a base to Tony Walters really well no but like I said it's not that this is gonna be the end of the cubs as we know it\nSure and I feel fine they still look your your nucleus is still a lot of very good young players but obviously you're not trending upward\nYou you're not you know it was World Series and obviously unless you win the world series you're you're not going to bring your state wanted an ID five dealer short of that yeah you went in and you came up empty you couldn't put away you couldn't put away the brewers a final week and a half of the season you gave away all lead\n... two weeks yeah no question about not like the brewers played lights out but if you gave away a lead and you're sitting where you are right now because of that\nSo you're going to see so you're going to see some change some different personnel and even though it's the hitting a really where you're going to need to improve you're gonna need to get some better pitching it and that's where it's going to be but\nI does this mean do they wind up clearance and stuff out to run a Bryce Harper\nDoes this mean they wind up going hog wild and and and and seeing some big time are you going to see personality traits\nAnd you're going to say well we got to get rid of this this guy and this guy and this guy because we need a better mix the players I mean certainly America fell in love with this cubs team a couple of years ago but now it's you don't look like I said you're not trending in the same direction while the other thing not you're not as strong as you were\nThe other thing here is that you're you're also looking at a team that's not young\nIt's it's it's not a youthful team you're a ... year your principles are in their in their late twenties early thirties not Pacific that's old but you know we're looking at the trends at least the teams that have been chasing them you've got a lot of guys in their mid twenties just hitting their power crimes\nThat you're going to be competing with show some shuffling up in the in the cubs and and they've always been active\nIn the off season a lot of these players acquired the trades or or the activity and free agency certainly the purse strings loose in the last couple of years so curious to see exactly how this blows many players or their contracts and uh in Nineteen\nExcept for a couple of your your long longstanding would be heroes of of years past that didn't get it done this time around\nTwitter at how about a fresco Mike it's rolling down the Jason

cubs go home the Rockies go on to the un LDS they will take on the Milwaukee Brewers were more than happy to take on this exhausted Colorado Rockies team who in the LDS but\nRight now it's all about the cubs and their early ouster here's comes manager Joe Madden beating the media following the game\nAnd joy is how much of this game was kind of a mark microcosm of the way things have gone to the guys offensively you know if you're wearing pretty well and runs this year but you had so many games where you just couldn't get the big ... ended up in zero one room\nYeah that's we we play that game a lot um believe me it was on on my mind for a large part of it we had some opportunities we just cannot cash in um [noise] I mean they pitch really well too um but we need to figure that out in the off season next spring training\n'em as my buddy tables with say we live too much chicken on the phone right there we've had plenty of opportunities\nUm and I I'm not here to denigrate anybody works put in he's in the barn everybody cares that just didn't play out this way offensively or we caught the ball we pitch really really well I'm like I said the esprit de corps I Can't ask for more so just so that we really up to focus on during the off season front row in the right\nAlong those lines with the last two home games playoff games you know to run so are you shocked by that [noise]\nWell I mean like if we just talked about it it's happened to this up and ah we've we've been in that we put ourselves in that position often um even though the games against the pirates to get to this point we didn't score a whole lot then we'd probably came back to one two oh we've had a series this year where we've scored hum how many lives are we going to Pittsburgh\nOne one per game in a four game series and won two of them you know so this is we we've been fighting with this um [noise]\nAnd I I Want to believe and I do believe that you're going to see a lot of these guys rebound moral offensively and that's just because they're very talented and they're young and they're not hurt to me it's like a an age of shooting a normally and it's also an injury issue but we're not we're not injured and we're not all um so I really anticipated nice Reba\nNo I'm I'm putting a been happy spent on this I'm anticipating a big worry about what's what's he going to say I'm going to the

man he's good at going to talk about immediately to the future right it's the\nHappier cheering your side of the bill bell jak we're on to Cincinnati yeah we're on tonight gain I mean it's the same kind of\nPhilosophy and why I Can't dwell on what just happened we've got to figure out what the roster looks like a going corn and we've gotten a few notes or in the Twitter verse related to cost and looking at Hayward and garbage it's contract yes like the Dodgers as we've talked about over the course of the night you can get the\nPodcast and I tune of Jason Smith show with Mike arm and coming up in about twenty five minutes or so but the fact of the matter is yes the cubs print money they they always will spend money and it certainly doesn't restrict them on a larger scale still when you're out forty two to forty five billion dollars on two players who can't play\nAnd you don't know what Jarvis health is yeah that does come in come into play a bit in terms of roster spots and and how useful they are I mean you saw a word here an opportunity with the bases loaded\nUh one of many going down flailing sixteen strike out on the day get 'em on get 'em over get him and that's why when they successfully executed a blood must fainted in my chair\nYeah yeah I mean that was really believes that little moment small twenty Eighteen base you don't see it that I don't want anyone ready
