the story the geneticists quote your samples from Mexico Peru in Colombia to stand in for Native American [noise]\n[noise] okay [noise] okay well okay\nIt's not like there's there is not any Cherokee that you know kind of [noise] and again it was one one thousandth or something or other it's less than what European Americans have\nThat's the other thing it's less than what European Americans have which is wow\nAnd that was from New York Times piece that there was a huge study that was done [noise] this was goodness way says a couple of years ago and it said quote with\nRespect to European Americans of percentages are much more different than African Americans or Latinos with America European American genomes being Ninety eight point six percent European point Nineteen percent African point Eighteen percent Native American hers this point zero nine [noise]\nSo it's actually less than European Americans and point zero nine percent let's make that clear because ... point zero nine as many coins your average ... percent that's [noise] that's pretty crazy\n[noise] [noise] so it it's just it's just worse so she is an average white person who\nSaid that she was a Native American so she could get jobs because in Iran eighty seven is when she began changing her ethnicity on formed that she herself filled out\n[noise] wow [noise] yeah and so it was it was more guys will now I proved that you didn't prove anything actually\nAnd if she thinks that Donald Trump owes a million dollars because he said if you prove you're an Indian and she goes well I ... no she was literally said she ... she was an Indian this is the most is is the dumbest thing ever we're gonna we got more on this and the latest the media the hill came out with a defense the stay with us [noise]\n\nFail\nYou want to listen to our for our radio [noise] downloaded that\n\nNot to be at a but he was ... was very critical\nOf uh the of Saudi Arabia um\nThere was a I mean there have been discussions about his his\nAbout his family [noise] um [noise] you know and we're going to talk to Steve and yet more about this but the way that the media he pulled us up\nThe way that the media has discussed is like for instance in New York Times article reality breaks up a Saudi prince charming media narrative because remember the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia\nHe did this whole he he he went to Los Angeles and he was he visited Hollywood and Silicon Valley and New York and he met with Michael Bloomberg and met with the Google founders and all kinds of stuff and\nThen there was a story that came out oh well he's allowing women to drive in Saudi Arabia and they're\nGetting more rights he's a moderate et cetera so he was doing this this I mean it really was a charm offensive and at the same time while the Iran deal was being deconstructed by this administration and so these two things put together made a lot of made Iran and green made a lot of um Iranian or\nThe surrogates upset and so that's why this is that's why the stories such a one of the reasons why it's such a hot you know a really a controversial issue and so\nThe way that the media wants to present is is that the president had a full faith and the crown prince and\nSaudi Arabia and this is a crown prince who jailed a lot of the former ah a lot of the other members of the royal family for what he said was corruption somewhere you know put to death et cetera um he apparently has been cracking down on any kind of like extremist associate I mean that's just what's been coming out\nAnd so um this this story has given\nThe uh\nPeople who are living at the administration for pulling out of the Iran deal it's given them the ability to attack an entity that they believe to be partially responsible for said undermining because they believe that pulling out of the Iran deal was a way to\nA tip the scales towards Saudi Arabia as opposed to Iran there have been a bunch of Hollywood folks that have pulled out of Saudi Arabia deals a film deals in business deals all kinds of stuff\nUm this um and they're trying to say well this is the president can't handle the and a and it just as he messed up this is why he doesn't he didn't know he he had faith in the wrong person the this is why we don't I mean they they're they basically want to create a justification for their dislike of this administration [noise]\nUm\nAnd so that's it and I've\nBeen seen uh what was that there were a couple of us celebrities that had tweeted that are very wealthy celebrities that are ... and tweeted that they're they're getting out of certain business deals are and this is so for instance a Washington Post\nI'm told\nTold us up I got a lotta information the editor in chief of Yahoo Daniel Klaidman wrote a close friend of Washington Post columnist Jim ... tells Michael is a cough as strict is a cough and me that Saudi crown prince may have felt emboldened by Trump's anti media\nRhetoric that the thing that I told you they're going to try every which way now remember Michael is accomplished the journalist that work\nWith using GPS in is said to have been paid by fusion GPS\nTo re appropriate and re purpose\nA Christopher Steele Hillary Clinton campaign document flash dot CA as a as the original investigative reporting that was later used to substantiate the application for the Pfizer warned against Carter Page and is a cough apparently offered no disclosures of any of this at any point it has never actually owned it\nIt's a ... that's what the report it so anything with the costs name I'm immediately you're biased antennas should go up so this is how they're going to try well you know anti media rhetoric\nThe record cetera ... et cetera but there's always wait a minute wait a minute no no no no so this was interesting how this has been uh they're they're they're trying to spin\nThis as a way to hit out at the administration and there and then there's a lot of back story to the independent had a huge piece\nUm let me pull this up that gets into\nUm [noise] on\nOne of a kind of gets into ... a family a little bit uh but it was more than just you know apparently like a Washington most journalists et\nCetera it it gets it without getting too much into the weeds it is pretty fascinating to see the way that the media is trying to push this he apparently\nDemocracy dog he was the author of 'em and Patrick pool who is a national security reporter overt PG media set in Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen eighty eight he um there was a story\nA a an Arab News in articles him apparently hanging around Afghanistan ... this is PJ our federal pull writes a\nNineteen eighty eight Arab News article and him to inter on Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden and al ... cofounder Abdullah Azzam he's he's a reformer holding an RPG hottest\nUh and then there was a there's there's\nMore a back\nStory there so there's it's a lot more than just cut and dry and the left is without waiting for the the bottom line is that he ... he is missing and we don't know what do you trust turkey do you trust\nIn crime or the FBI says they have evidence that directly refused to well if it has evidence that directly repeats premise of Trump Russia probe according to one top Republican lawmaker John Ratcliffe\nHe said that the evidence related to former Trump it's ... it's related to George Papadopoulos\nUh they said that there's been nothing that has proven the premise for opening the pro which of course remember they said Dan she aided that through

what is your take on this\nDay and I think it's a difficult but very very important to step back from things like this realized how incorrect and misleading initial reports almost always are\nEven just in the last twenty four hours we've been getting some ... uh and then also just acknowledge even those of us who are legit experts we're dealing with a lot of uncertainties in a region but as far from a collection of state\nOr the middle east broadly speaking is not a real realm of black and white\nOr you have more evil and less evil more danger in less danger and in some cases we can get caught in a single case of destruction from what the greatest danger in the region is and in my view that's the fear ... in Iran or does it means daughters are clean or just but we have to I think start from\nThe first reports are almost always wrong and I think that's likely the case here and that this is a much much more complicated a challenge in the region wrote an on off switch with military support for Saudi Arabia like some of our friendly senators up or go so far\nYeah and I I've seen a lot of knee jerk reactions are within some in a certain political party or were they say oh this should means sanctions on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia said if there's any sanctions you know obviously that's going to disrupt a the oil market et cetera there's already been warnings of\nThat um but at the same time I mean isn't that this also still seems I I feel like this is really being seized upon by all of those people mad that the Iran deal was deconstructed under this administration and this is just to try to it and I mean from where I see it\n... it trying to tip the balance of power in that region from Saudi Arabia to Iran is that kind of also happening here there's like a ... there's there's some subplot happening\nThere are a in ... from from my point of view there is an extension of Trump's arrangements syndrome that leads\nPeople to very disgusting\nLee in my view cheer for some of the worst people in the world in getting an advantage over America and our allies in the region a book I'm completely open to the possibility that the Saudi Arabia government is involved in\nThis potential murder but let's let the evidence come in and then let's deal with it within the context of this is an outrageous act against one person or it crosses a several line should be dealt

Latin American because they didn't use ... they didn't use indigenous North American [noise] yeah they didn't it didn't do it\nAnd just so everybody I mean she again just to remind people can you just put it on audio sorry this is a woman who said to her mom was was Cherokee and her dad a her dad's family was racist listen\nYou haven't rolling about what it is I Believe was started fair [laughter]\nMom and dad all were very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and\nFather's parents said absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee and she's part Delaware and all [noise] after fighting it as long as they could my parents went off they loved it was an issue\nSo she said that her dad's family was racist then as it turns out she actually is wider\nThan European Americans because European Americans have Eighteen ... point Eighteen percent uh and she had point zero nine percent sure\nYeah oh and she didn't just say she had native ancestry she said she was Cherokee and her book of plagiarize recipes power chow she said it was before she found herself Elizabeth Warren hyphen Cherokee uh she also began identifying herself on forms a at\nA University of Pennsylvania law school in Nineteen eighty seven as a a\nAs a someone who was a minority she said she was Cherokee a it how she was able to further advanced herself at Harvard Harvard promoted her as a woman of color all of the PDF of all this stuff out there still exist like the forums the ah everything out there still exists the the way that they\nAre promoted her and she promoted herself an academic journals things that only she could actually use to identify\nAnd and and furthermore a she made up her as she might have the story about our mind being a Cherokee she changed her ethnicity enlisted herself as a minority uh this is a woman who she didn't say Shiite ancestry she said she was Cherokee that's the difference\nAnd the DNA report by the way it didn't actually measure Native American DNA it measured Colombian DNA and Mary ... measure Peruvian DNA and measured Mexican DNA and determine that she might possibly have a tiny fraction of those\n[noise] and she's like well it could prove it I'm a Native American [noise] what the hell no\nHey she's like not really even Native American but you know people like the guy who was a man who is identifying as a woman can tell everyone you don't believe in science unless you believe that I'm actually a woman\nI I don't like I Can't understand some of the logic and all of this but you know what ... shoes if they're using it yeah anyway today I'm Sorry I was running out of ...\nOf 'cause there's so much of it it was or\nWasn't weren't stuff was really a run for top menu also throw up widow of roads

media you'd always conflated\nWhen they have to make up close and in an attribute them to you that's when you know the air you're winning that's don't ever\nDon't let them get people wonder why they don't trust the media media wonders why people don't trust the folks have a great night I'll be back with you tomorrow [laughter]\n\n...\nAre free [noise] downloaded\nThat's all it took and now suddenly hey we're really in business and a half minutes seems like we got plenty of time because that we're adding to the ... that's a huge not only that but knowing that we can get this play out of bounds because we're running you know time out\nAnd who knows what would have happened 'cause I guarantee you if that play doesn't get out of bounds things go a little bit differently for the ... they go a little bit because they you know they they still struggle little bit to get up to the line of scrimmage and run but he gets out of bounds so they can run and call and then it's\nThe big Aaron Rodgers scramble up the middle of the field it's to have that kind of\nGrace under pressure in the final minute or two minutes of the game is is is just\nIt separates everybody and it separates Rogers and Brady from everybody else because not everybody can do that Peyton Manning couldn't always do that you know some guys are good at it some guys are better at the end the games and they are in the middle of games 'cause they think too much\nAnd they you know they they don't process information is fast they should but the and the games\nThings beat up and they're good at it other quarterbacks a really bad at it\nAnd they're really good but you get to the final ... minutes it's like\nWe're not getting down to the field but just not the kind of team he's not the kind of quarterback we can't make the big throws we can't make the throws on time we're not going to get up to the ... up to the feeling time is going to be a question about play calling play calls you in the coming from the sidelines could be a late play call so were you sitting there working out the signals 'cause they changed the play because of whatever is on the field\nAnd there's that indecisive and this and some people never get it\nAnd when you have that kind of advantage I mean you wonder why these guys are winning so many games or in the playoffs every year because of that how many times have you seen them at the end the games nothing is too big no time is is too little even with no time outs going up and down the ... well that's one of the\nThings that we've heard from breeze in radio a lot of their quotes about longevity particularly Brady and all the interviews he's done that that Tom against time and all that stuff is just everything's slower right you just you've seen every situation so your mind\nProcesses that added to normal pace instead of All right the clock is running and you're feeling that pressure it's let's go up and make a play or what's going execute and however they're able to convey that to the other ten guys on the field that's the amazing thing right because those guys aren't\nHall of fame Aaron Rodgers Tom Brady type participants and yet they get it to end it all slows down that they're able to get that calm in what's left them huddles around the NFL but to get their players and the robber proper\nPerspective and performance and and getting guys to to do things the right way I mean we've seen how many teams beset by running backs you fight for an extra yarn and then they're held in violence in this case Montgomery who's not even I mean I guess he's still the number one they must really hate Aaron Joan\nDe count your average over five yards you carry but you're not getting on the field I'm not getting on the field sit down and you sit next to me you sit next to many okay that's where you're going to have him after he and the guys averaging five point nine and caring for the year yet he can't get more than eight touches\nIt's you know what ... and and you wonder at the end it's because we trust time Montgomery more than we trust Aaron John whatever Josie gotten out of bounds stomach I mean okay gotta get out and I'd like\nTo write a guy who's been as effective as Jones is yet it's Montgomery again on the money well\nAnd it's and it's also McCarthy being for all the criticism he got whenever the Packers are going bad McCarthy gets criticized like McCarthy's fault that is the way calling and everything all the ... they're all laws I mean well like for coffee is a heck of a coach and he always\nIs able to have is players not so much being well disciplined but always knowing the right place to make knowing when I Can't fight for the extra yard I'm not going to be a pile on here and try to put the ball over the goal line\nThis is again what Bill Belichick chicken Mike mccarthy do that many other coaches can't get their players to do they can't get them to stop being heroes or to or to realize I'm going to fight for this extra five yards and that's the wrong place to make because now you're stuck in bands and now you're spiking the ball but it's it's making the smart place and being able to do it in the final minute look\nThe three best quarterback I've ever seen as far as at the end of games right\nKennel Brian Richard ... the three best quarterback\nAt the end the games in my life ... they took their helmets off the disgust better than anybody else [laughter] this is going back to when I started really been able to watch what's been going back to the modern era like the eighties and beyond when I when I really started watching football and the three guys that are the best at the end of the game I've ever seen Joe Montana\nTom Brady Aaron Rodgers and there is no coincidence that on the list the best quarterbacks of all time\nThese are the guys that are going to be up there to look in Reno was great in the final two minutes the fourth quarter as well you know Peyton Manning was pretty darn good these guys are just a little bit better because overall their teams function more as a as a as a whole better\nThan their teams that cars look Dan Marino lost a lot of shootouts Peyton Manning lost a lot of shootouts but these three guys and there's a reason why hey ...\nWhat do they have in common there all different styles quarterbacks but they all do when in the final two minutes they can get it done time outs doesn't that three time outs no tend not to makes no difference give me a minute on the clock that's all I Need\nAnd you know what it's just appropriate on this day we're we're celebrating all things Milwaukee because of the Packers and the brewers they're cool like ...\nThe greatest day in the history of Wisconsin sports tonight about that\nJust for a second I feel like we need to order some cheese is it why she's every day I mean [laughter] I tell my eyes to Wisconsin everyday speech I should just start shaking but you think about think about greatest sports day in Wisconsin sports history yes the Packers of one Super Bowl but you had the Packers when a huge come from behind game on Monday Night\nAnd the brewers take the lead in the end they'll see us two games
