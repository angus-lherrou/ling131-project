{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "But this is where Frank Reich failed and you can't cut this up any of the way it's not as simple as all if they make it easy here oh no it's not because what Frank Reich has to realize is there are merit in a tie there are more ties now in the NFL because of the overtime rules we've already seen a couple\nAnd you are in a position where you have to realize what's the likelihood we're going to convert this and when this game what Frank writes did was put losing the game back on the table this wasn't sports in two from the Texans forty and you know what I can go forward here 'cause\nHe's on his own side of the field he's got five yards to make on fourth down and I'm going to give the ball back with a chance for the Texas to get one big past play and then kick a field goal that's exactly what happened\nIs football was like baseball fever metrics people would have been in these you're yelling Frank you have like a Thirteen percent chance of succeeding here\nBecause that's really what what the percentage chance of success was so low this wasn't as simple as its fourth and one of the poor do I go for joined not it's look at everything that goes along with that you have a tough time getting this because it's five yards you put losing the game back on the table and\nThere are merits in a tie because you never know what it's going to come down to at the end of the season for a playoff berth or not certainly a tie at this point is that I I Know you're frustrated I Know you're upset but that's a big thing\nAnd lastly Frank Reich is a first year head coach and he's got to realize that if I don't make this that I'm gonna get absolutely crucified by fans the media and everybody else I'm a first year head coach\nAnd people are gonna fake I don't know what I'm doing\nBecause I decided to go for the win and it backfired and now\nThat's exactly what people are wondering just rank right now what he's doing to strike right now now the next time he makes a mistake it's going to be Frank right can't do it and now we got we got to turn the page on him he will lose cashing in the locker room he'll lose cache with the fans\nAnd it's going to be Frank Reich you giving yourself short rope to succeed in the NFL because of that he's basically put his own neck on the chopping block saying okay next time I screw something up I'll be out of a job\nWhen you're a first year head coach doing things like that it's just not smart\n... means even wash mistake the big fork down play against the Colts a few years ago but bell chicken won three superbowls so if he makes a bad call well OK clearly the guy knows what he's doing he's built up the cache to make a couple of bad call he can't do he can't do that Frank right does not have that kind of latitude to make those mistakes I think he does\nAt this point in his tenure or look you've got some mathematicians work guys for the corps you said it's about thirty seven percent are allowed to go and run the the algorithms in and do the math myself a plot to get out a historically but the the fact to where I see it is All right you're already on three\nTeam's not very good you've had the game of your lives nobody expected Andrew Luck to put up the numbers and the game that he did and the score what they did on that day so here you're trying to push if nothing else for the you're you're fighting for the when you're fighting for your guys you believe as you\nMarched up and down the field that you can get one more time and indeed this locker room that you're still winning over and I'm sure you know he's done a lot to do that I think the players saying hey we're we're going to go for it and I've got your back and and this is what we're going to be we're going to be aggressive and go for when\nI think that that carries its weight right now you got a very young team around Andrew Luck\nYou look at the office of wind that you've shoveled out you are missing TY helped me I think a lot of it had to do with just very much and that idea of right this is the atmosphere and this is the culture that I Want to build that we don't let anything stop it is what the tide you for only three team\nNo no that would ever want it to their they would have been one to win one right watch as one joined in with his fellow what but what is it what it said it it's a positive move it looked thirty seven percent that's not a good enough chance to to put losing again back on the table\nThat's not a good enough chance for that it's gotta be hey it's either fifty fifty at best and do it on the other team side of the field at such a huge gamble to say okay we're going to put losing the game back into perspective it went from the Texas with zero percent chance to win to hey how they could win and they want\nAnd not not at your percent chance on what he went into a fetal position with football needed any ...\nWhat was your age thing well yeah but if you're hunting and then how much can go wrong there yeah but most likely not maybe thirty seven percent or so about that much oh we got more from the NFL coming up next Fox\n[noise]\nEverybody's got

so I was wrong today I thought the Rockies with when I'm now you look at it and say okay the cubs have had the advantage of\nPlay in the early game that the advantage of significant her own beds tonight and and and understanding what's at stake tomorrow where the Rockies up to fly all the way across the country almost all away from LA to Chicago and and get ready to play that game\nI it's advantage cubs for me 'cause you've got to postseason tested pitcher and in last year and then ... going on short rest\nSo that that's that is a tough task to ask ... who's been amazing this year but they go on short rest I think is is difficult in that circumstance after a long flight up so I I Would say guys it's advantage cubs tomorrow but then again it wouldn't surprise me if I'm wrong for a second straight day because\nI certainly that that is that while there have been my character my friend it's all good Ron oh good for all rolling dice in in a throwing darts you know that's all\nWell and and actually I'll say this to keep in mind as I'm thinking about this more now at the very least the cubs as they use their best bullpen pieces today there was a close game so maybe the rocket had

on TV today about our franchises six stars those three teams Aaron Rodgers Cam Newton or do back um junior\nThat was it those are the real only six stars the NFL out whenever they try to put other teams on national television people didn't watch it was it was lower ratings because the NFL was having a star problem\nAfter week to\nIn the NFL after week three\nBaker may feel became a star

that makes you want to watch and see what he does root for him or root against him\nHe's got that it factor\nAnd then you have a guy who's dominance through the first three weeks which is great\nAnd then when you're a dominant on Monday Night football you become a superstar\nChannel on\nTouched on this time he goes in front of yours out much shapes on this Monday Night game tasteless waiting for the end zone on a home scramble\n... sweep through the end zone [laughter]\nLike want to do that now ... ... donut nectar in the end zone Mitch holes as happy for hundreds tonight yeah where are these radio network on the call Patrick homes brings the chiefs back to a twenty seven twenty three victory over the Broncos\nHe had a bad game the first three quarters they could not put points on the board the Broncos hold on a clinic of this is how we're going to slow down Patrick ... we're going to send a lot of pressure at him\nAnd we're going to keep them in the pocket and he's going to be scattered and throw the ball early and throw it away and he did he was very inaccurate in the first I was living out of twenty two you saw how many passes did he try to throw to Travis Kelsey that would be below him to the side of the ground\nAnd the Broncos at a great job of sticking on Kelsey and on ...\nYou're probably going to call the holding or many are illegal contact down you know and all these on Chelsea they did a super cut of five or six players when he was just getting bullied and yet he's still finishes with a huge game 'cause while the philosophy changed\nBecause in late in the second half\nThe chiefs open things up more what it looked to me was the Broncos defense got tired sure because they didn't seem like they could still chase my homes around the way they had earlier in the game and certainly when you're asking your defensive players to cover these guys one on one for most of the game eventually they're going to get tired well in in the first half\nThey did a good job of setting both Hedges writes a defect advances made home showed moms had no room to operate had to say between the tackles that lapsed in the second half giving you a little more time to dance and let the receivers break containment\nBut Sanders comes by doesn't really look for the ball\nSo that's as much on him as it is a cassette and get drilled right as Sanders has come by and I think Sanders became a bystander rather than looking for the ball yeah so as much as people want to go after ... want to go after the call\nIf he takes the hand off from Sutton there I I don't think he gets\nCaught you think it's a touchdown and win the game so you know the excellence of execution that we harp on so many times here there were just there were a couple of opportunities for the Broncos due\nTo seize sees the game and let's face it if you keep settling for fuel goals against this team\nSixty minutes mhm it's not going to go by fast enough ... is a daunting to try to beat the ... just quickly laid down field I mean what that ridiculous are on that Holmes has any any rate in your coverage in the secondary he finds a way\nYou know it it comes down and we will talk a lot more about my homes but for the Broncos it came down to those two places at the end of regulation you talked about the ... where are they had the first down but still looking ladder okay the play before\nTo me that's the bigger ones that sounded a touchdown yeah I mean case Keenan has to marry as it's blown coverage by the chief he has to marry as Thomas wide open down the right side line it's a touchdown dumb areas Thomas's walking in the end zone with\nTwelve seconds left and the game is over and the Broncos will have one but case Keenan overthrows him\nAnd as a result the final play they have is the hook in light of play that doesn't go their way that someone 'cause that's the one where you know what we missed it this is a ... that's the last plane yeah\nIt was a bad call because look ... you had the first one had a question though is you could have got tackled and they spike the ball and have one more play for the end zone maybe\nBut even with a certain way right as he makes the catch he's coming back to the quarterback he might have already passed the lined the game as he caught the ball\nYeah well they they don't show how what a bit of a review right I think they would have given it to him because it looked like when he caught it he was still behind the line but he doesn't know that at the time he's right at the market and the play called and that's what they call it he's about\nTo get drilled so thinking about the walk in and everything so I mean there's a million things going on there\nAnd I buy or look and that's why the play was designed that way to say okay we're going to throw it at the stick\nAnd everybody is going to converge on you for the tackle\nBecause you're right at the stick and you're going to pitch it\nSo I'm sure that was all things that you're right the sick so he's taking the whole time not oh I have the first down and I could get tackled buddies taking this was the place supposed to be executed it just wasn't executed the right way but will that missed pass I mean I'm a bronco fans like look I that's that's something where I look at it and go\nI Will think about that place for a long time 'cause that's ... that's the guy we brought in and it was everything they wanted him to be on that final drive he converts on a big fourth down he throws a big path for forty hours when he gets absolutely I didn't realize he was getting at an ad\nYeah but the camera obviously goes down deals with oh I Need the other one back on the quarterback that was one of those places where I looked at what I'm saying look outlook outlook out and he just gets\nKilled and what you do it in and delivered a beauty I mean that was it that was schemes moment it was I Am the same guys I was last year I could look you win a game like this on Monday Night football and suddenly hey case keen them the Broncos they win the game that I Would the chief stop everything is there suddenly Denver's great now\nAnd instead it was a case Canaan Canaan Canaan staying case you get to me that's how close it was that's how close it was for the Broncos that plate of all the things my home's did which he did so many great things and the left hand to pass is going to get a lot of attention and all of that I I I firmly agree that's the best thing\nBut that pass is when they see this game I'm going to speak of various Thomas running go oh my God he just missed them yeah I'm thinking back\nTo some of those third down that they didn't pick up earlier it's like either of them still goes no no you can't settle for three and it's like when you're playing the patriots would be the Randy Moss here it's like yeah you'll goes doing you know even if it's ... minutes into her score\nDo for [laughter] keep pushing his three three pointers of winning you a game but here in Denver did all the good great work on the outside and then watch what's ... got got free uh that entire game changed and it was must see viewing for the second out\nTwitter at how

the variety of my my practicing that uh I did it a couple of times in college but it was to throw it away I never had thrown it to a receiver so I mean it was it was a cool dealing with the first I

because clearly there are two great teams in the NFL the chiefs and the rams Baron there's everybody else\nGreat teams in the NFL and then there's every ... there are two great teamed up in the NFL\nAnd then there's what about the patriots that you left for dead there are two great teams in Ireland that's ever been hotter and then there's everybody land Edelman returns you know there are two great teams\nIn the NFL just because you keep saying that doesn't make it sure does but\nWhat about Andy Reid smile and Andy met the media few minutes ago talking about the cheese big twenty seven twenty three when over the Broncos\n... needed to tighten up they tightened up one of those before the house or at the end of the game [laughter] big Blitzer than to make something happen or on the mic turns it into a long field and it ended up in our favor on uh the office aside Patrick and [laughter] yeah I've worked real hard\nOn that left hand to throw you know make sure you do that uh there were some amazing plays Aaron along the artist of choices for a while there were just shooting ourselves in the foot with penalties and we'd have a big gate and then have a penalty in there and it uh [laughter]\nYou know it didn't hurt us but um [noise] and then you came to this uh Irish cream just coming coming out and uh I'm having a a big day to a hundred and twenty plus yards carrying the football and and um [noise] um again [noise]\nTremendous job so but I mean I can keep going here but it's it's a special teams I did a heck of a job and\nUh you need this oh you know we've talked about having a lead and everybody's asked about what if you're behind how's it going to react how's Patrick how to react and\nSo um [noise] we we got a taste of that [noise] yeah so he's a confident kid he was confident before that it is not going to be will be overconfident from but I think it tells you that tells everybody really the ...\nYou're you're within striking distance or you know you have that opportunity to where the guy that can make plays guys wrote may plays too so that's a this is this wasn't just Patrick but it sure is nice was\nHigh so there is anti Reid talking about how great patch homes was even completed a pass lefty to tire retail for a first down when he was getting ... and look\nOf all the new quarterbacks getting the attention we spend a lot of time on Baker Mayfield and Sam Donaldson Josh Rosen and Josh Allen obviously so because these are the new guys\nPatrick ... Holmes has become\nThe best quarterback in the NFL through four weeks in the national football league there's been nobody better than him at Jared golf has been really good nobody's been better than my home he is in\nA perfect position is succeed he has walked into a team with a good offensive line with phenomenal player makers all over the place and many guys are jealous that they are not playing in that system but my home's has taken advantage of\nEverything that he can as far as throwing guys open he does that a lot because you can throw the ball so far down field where he takes advantage of plays keeps plays open looked at a second in thirty on that final drive and he completes a pass for twenty five yards\nAfter you know scrambled to the right and throws on the run and throws a bullet\nI mean this kid is so special and I don't know that there's a way to stop him\nOnly slow him down most guys you figure out okay there's a way to stop we even Baker may feel in a second Saudi through for picks writes Brazil should have won the game but he threw for ... you can stop Baker may feel you've stopped Sam Donald really the jets of stops him Donald but you can do that all the other guys but my home\nThe Broncos put out tonight the best blueprint I've seen yet to try to beat the cheeks they put a lot of pressure on ... homes and kept them inside the pocket\nAnd my home's didn't like it look don't know quarterbacks like pressure but the best quarterbacks find a way to find a way around it staying and make throws he threw the ball late\nLow he threw it early to everywhere but his wide receivers in the first half he tried Travis Kelsey on five passes and everything was low to the side it wasn't clubs\nAnd Tariq was blanketed deep down field by Broncos ... this was the blueprint this is okay this is how we're going to do it not many teams can it's very simple it's not and I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel by saying here here's something special so this is what you have to do but so many teams\nDon't have that they don't have the personal elderly due to the quarterback and and to have to do one on one in coverage in ... and stay on guys tight on a truck that you're going to actually\nDo that right and here you got the benefit or most of this game is that you didn't have to contend with Sandy Watkins\nShrinking down the field right after he leaves with a hamstring injury uh so far I mean as you go through the post game analysis that is something that that certainly is put off to the side because of the game that was playing was fantastic but that's that's one other element to the\nChiefs off at they didn't have to contend with in the Denver defense but you saw the second half or on\nStarting to get tired didn't can hold contain on the edges as much got out to that right edge quite a bit to be able to win the ball down field as we've seen him in the past is where he was off he stole that were nobodies catch neither is receiver orange nobody got put up for grabs you don't see already got five near misses and\nAnd I've seen for a couple of weeks now all the comparisons going back to Brett Farr teammates compare and I you know that's what I kind of see out of him\nAnd and certainly trust his arm\nOr like Brett Farr did but he doesn't put the ball in harm's way like Brett Farr did\nYou do you reminds me of and this is this is it it's weird but follow me or for a second he reminds me of Aaron Rodgers\nIn that Aaron Rodgers thing what he does better than anybody else as he is always looking down field he is not going to dump the ball off to a running back he is not he just doesn't have that mentality he\nIs I Am looking down field but I'm going twenty yards down field there's a running back here I don't care no I can see my wide receiver run 'em back shoulder or something I'm always looking down feel\nAnd that's what makes Aaron Rodgers so dangerous\nAnd that's what allows him to scramble at times too because he's everybody's got to be down field\nThat's a lot of what ... does he's always looking down field\nNow certainly there a place you want to run a screen to ... you want to give them all the swing fast because he's not dangerous but that's the design play he is never looking for where's my safe option I what's the most yards I can get on this plan I feel like that's sometimes the most charges it's eight yards over the middle of Kelsey\nSometimes it's thirty yards down the left side line but he's always looking down feeling kind of reminds me\nAnd he's got a little bit more mobility than Rogers obviously Rogers is older\nAnd you know certainly has been being does got one leg right now but yeah but my homes is younger and more mobile and people don't realize that he's a mobile enough quarterback but he is that kind of guy and that's kind of where that is kind of where he is at right now we were my you've got that strong arm even stronger on\nThat Aaron Rodgers does and you know when you get down field when coverage can't be that tight those guys are you know defensive backs need to be five yards offer you\nWhy that's why\nYou know nobody's saying which is all like nobody saying when this event happened I vividly remember you and I think it does it matter if the guy is good nothing else matters if he turns out to be good nobody right now is saying you know\nThe parents gave up a lot to move up for Michel ... I don't know what I meant that trade fire was that it does it matter if a quarterback turns out to be good nobody cared you could give up three old drafts and it does it matter nobody's saying that right now but John like really just leased the barest right there that's really some of it even on the day that it happened\nIt was it was the dumbest thing the forty niners guys I five each other and you got Jimmy gee\nThat was good but at the very\nNext to trade they go get their guy right in this whole league is about finding your guy that you think is going to see what you're doing now obviously it was before Matt Maggie comes on board\nOr that they bring tribute skiing so you know getting acquainted a little bit and we we did in months and months ago I was glad to see it start picking up steam got better season began up but we equated it to what they were doing with with the ...\nOffensive Leah bringing in weapons or to find the off that's why building it'd be better for a little Mac comes on board and then giving your guy an offensive coach to go right right Jeff Fisher to Shaun ... bay John Fox\nTwo matinee and here we go and so it took a couple of games you get paid a lot to bring in Britain and Alan Robinson and now you got things clicking I mean the only people that were upset a during that game and the beat down of the buccaneers were Jordan our fantasy [laughter]\nBeyond that I think everybody was\nLooking at this with an eyebrow raiser going okay here we go it's odd because the comparison\nTo what my homes was doing the first three weeks of the season versus some near misses from ... some overthrows of of raw an open Robin sin and others that all of a sudden the equalizer oh and call back the continuing to do a little Mac thing\nTwitter out how about a ...
