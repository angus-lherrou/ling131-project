first postseason period\nThe only other time and his crew that he has had this atmosphere was playing for our country in the world Baseball Classic which he did quite well by the way I think in twenty

ninth inning rally but you're not able to put the big hits together but you're on the defensive 'cause that the things you didn't have to answer for all year because they just magically came together for you\nSuddenly you know there wasn't a pinch hit there wasn't something that you needed to do manage yearly and other than the CDC's about the Internet and your grappling because you're saying well [laughter] well\nYou know he's trying to figure out the worst because it was five straight it right had better yeah right now even in the moment as you were watching and listening to it following it on line or whatever you're doing yeah I had to be scratching your head going okay you've got to go get him\nReady is at least got to stop this because we had to do and what somebody up in the bullpen right you didn't have any because you had the two hits followed by the wild pitch\nOr the wild pitch you gotta think there's at least double barreled action up and starting to get loose knowing it's got to become a bullpen game pretty fast even if you don't call on them there in that moment that they're going to need to be ready so that that's really more I think where it comes down to you and he lost in that moment\nWhat I've told you for months Aaron Boone has had to do zero what the New York Yankees as you're my favorite phrase zero carbon footprint you would never know when you're building wind the Yankees came out of the gates and they bashed so everything was fine\nWhen did the Yankees need Aaron Boone when they went through the swoon in August and they started falling out of contention to win the elites didn't Aaron Boone do anything that he juggle the lineup did he take some blame for ... for the call guys out whatever it is\nAnd every manager does things they're different way not saying what he had to do I'm just giving you examples of things he could have done Aaron Boone did nothing why because he every thing he did lose a I don't want to do anything to screw this up I like being the Yankee manager\nAnd I want to stay doing this so we just nothing while the Yankees gave away first place to the red Sox okay now you get to the playoffs and everything goes right\nIn the in the play a game against the A's and now you get to the red socks series and what does he do twice that he normally did during the regular season\nThis is the difference between managing and the regular season and for the post season when you're starting pitcher who is one of the guys you depend on what he has a rough\nIt's a chance that got off the hook and a team that won the series won the series now you could say this is full of twists and turns Red Sox win game one Yankee game to put the pressure on the red Sox Red Sox Gore sixteen runs that was it okay or game for when\nShe appears makes us play maybe it's the game ending played a series any place a turning point\nMan he's going to get a bunch of autograph saw in the world series it twenty five bucks a pop for the rest of his life but he ... his name was only five for the inch corruption that set strapped to stretch it will be the stretch that said that'll be if they win the world series it will be known as the stretch\nAnd they'll sign those pictures for the rest of his buddy that'll be the Halloween costume what are you doing up here like I may just dragging your ...\nWhat the hell's that guy on the ground here if you want to look at what the turning point of this series was\nIt really was game on Chris\nSale is on the mound and it's a game where if you're the Yankees are we're not expecting to win but we're hopeful that we can keep the game clothes gets sell out of the game and we can maybe when it gets the red Sox really bad bullpen\nSales pitch as well but they get them out of the game and the red Sox take a big lead but the Yankees claw back\nAnd that six and seven inning\nWhen the Yankees loaded the bases six that any load the bases with two outs and for some reason laboratories a swing and wildly pitches after the last two Red Sox pitchers walk the last two Yankee batters he gave up that back to the red Sox in the sixth inning\nAnd then the seventh inning the Yankees have bases loaded and nobody out and they turned it into all of one Ron oh by the way Stan struck out ... too so you have those chaotic as I said just a theme building it's not a stand thing it's just that was the turning right\nWhere the Yankees had a chance to topple the red Sox in a Christian Bale game\nAnd seize control warning game one in Fenway and now we're going to kick your ass that's what they could have done but those two innings bases loaded back to back\nAnd you get one run out of it the ... the second time we have nobody out that was that allowed the red Sox regal off the hook\nSale wins the red Sox game one they lose game to no big deal you own a Yankee Stadium blow 'em out in game three they have enough to win the game for that was the game that could have gone either with a series could have gone either way at that point and the Yankees couldn't when the red Sox escape that was a turning\nPoint as we we talked about what John John Palmer owes you a little bit earlier than the fact that over the course of twenty Eighteen we made a lot of jokes a and a lot of derisive commentary about three outcome major league baseball world\nAnd as you point out in that game one situation it's situational hitting\nGet them on get 'em over get 'em in June ... Jake what where where the ball instead of trying to drive it and and take each pitch out of the park\nBut you know base hit still count it they're still part of of baseball teams that are a fishing in doing it but you saw only swinging for the beginning getting under balls pop out lazy fly balls you saw that time and again instead of trying to just work\nAt bat work counts you you saw in that game\nYet uncharacteristically you've got to walk out of sale and each of the next three relievers walked batters are giving you opportunities with Reuters on move over\nMake things happen in stead you're not you're getting one run and ending innings because you're trying to look for that big hit and those came over the course of the season again\nPlayoff baseball bit differently each one of those runs you're able to eke out is the difference again look at the red Sox tonight thrill lead you get the solo homerun that makes it for nothing that's what makes it stand up\nAfter the furious comeback in the ninth inning but you you look at the Yankees that was the story of their series putting caps laid it perfectly in that six seven thinning of game on\nMe that that was that was it that was a game where the Yankees could have taken control you didn't ... really was it because they were playing catch up from that moment all and you had\nThe opportunity to crawl back at Rikers happy was terrible two innings ... he'd been really into\nAll the games heroin okay it's out the window for us but what about you know hey we're now when I opened\nIt just gave me a crack that you could maybe eke out to run there and suddenly it's a five four game instead five three and you're still pushing\nAnd I said not to make it a stand thing because we're going to get to him coming spot you realize the two biggest that bats are the series were Stanton batting with nobody out in the bases loaded in game one of the seventh inning and he struck out the trash and then he's batting with two on nobody out in the ninth inning after kimbrell is wild any strikes out\nYeah he was that was I mean not just the at bat tonight if the other one as well where it's boy those are the two times the Yankees could have really gone from\nLosing two were winning or you know keeping that first any like not that he needed to hit a home run but let's see walks gets a single the Yankees gotta run its five three they still at first and second or first and third and they're off to the races that anything because everybody's kind of nervous right keep the pressure on time couldn't put the ...\nWe talked about before the series and there was a great opportunity you got into the bullpen right fail only went fine so you have the opportunity to get out that pen\nAnd didn't do the damage likewise throughout the rest of the series certainly games three and four laid down no ... you had three walks zero home runs what you've counted on all year long Twitter at how about a ... bike is swollen

can save you Fifteen Percent or more car insurance go to guy go dot com right now find out just how much you can save so already blame is starting to come out somewhat\nFor who the Yankees really find that fault for this series last year the Boston Red so good you got a point some blame somewhere or we said it was going to be John Carlos than yup ... oh no backing them down and now angel Hernandez has figured angel Hernandez just because it's name gets people\nClenching up a little bit he's a ban on pie or he always winds up getting involved in controversy he's got a you've got an attitude of everybody is here to seeing the umpire the game and he's had that his entire career think about how many of the guys that we knew\nAre still up ... most of those guys are gone yes no angel Hernandez this world it's like wow he's the one guy their ass man stand he umpire last night first base and had three of his calls overturned at the Knight nobody was happy with him nobody being the Yankees ... behind the plate as she sees the bath you said\nWho is losing pitcher tonight for the Yankees quote he's absolutely terrible he was terrible behind the play today he was terrible at first base it's amazing how he's getting jobs umpiring in these playoff games report cello who started for the red Sox I say well cc throw the ball over the plate\nAnd maybe angel Hernandez would call strikes for you now see she's about you did say no we didn't lose because of this but\nHow he gets assignments he's terrible and this is where I agree with him on\nThey didn't lose the series because of angel Hernandez lost the game last night sixteen to one they lost tonight oh Ben attendee will tell you how did I strike out in the eighth inning with bases loaded that was a horrible cause the bad pitch it was a bad pitch and yet that could have been in that bad that swung the game and the Yankees have no chance on it\nBut the bottom line is I don't see how he continues to get postseason assignments you can't just fired the guy because you have bad umpires the NFL has bad referees you have bad on piracy but\nYou can have guys like this getting assignments like he does because he has all this controversy surrounding him because he does make mistakes he's got an incredibly\nElitist attitude that he is not shy was importing on the other players he's a bad headlines for major league baseball\nHow he deserves and continues to get these assignments is beyond me if he gets another one\nThe he's suing the you know be for discrimination because you always not getting the assignments he's been a battle buyer for years he's been the worst umpire for you you look and see what never a dull Hernandez is running and I go and it happens about six times a year ago he just really screwed something up or through somebody out of the game for a reason that that it didn't really matter\nThis guy should not be working in the postseason I Would do the major league baseball oh Arnett is gonna be behind the plate I'm suing you for the world series that's what I Would do if I were the Dodgers brewers", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "10"}
