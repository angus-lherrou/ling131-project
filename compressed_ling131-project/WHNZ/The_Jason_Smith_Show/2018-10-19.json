[noise] the deadline as I ... I Hope I now for also available seven seven\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nBanning sick of all over me during the show [noise]\n\nI was notified hassles just light Kamala Harris who she's wanting to abuse her power to investigate journalists and I thought everyone was supposed to support a free press I thought everybody supported a free press\nApparently not though apparently she doesn't well we're going to\nI Hope somebody asks come on media summer you had to give me the names of the people that are moderate in this debate tonight\n[noise]\nOr it looks like we have Judy Woodruff of PBS NewsHour um you have St Louis Public Radio's Germany's you have five on your sides local anchor Mike Bush\nAnd then a question from the audience will be taken and be part of the debate as well and that will be facilitated by ... of the nine that work ...\nWell the one of which I I guess I Am a fan is uh I like my Bush I grew up with my Bush so much listed the whole thing with that guy who got killed in a plane crash\nAt our guy Mike what's his face not like Bob Bob Bob Richards that guy dang that's old school I remember when that happened I was a kid and I didn't quite understand exactly everything that was going on that's along my Bush has been around he's like a\nHe's like a fixture in my home town but I think he'll be I think he'll do decent job 'cause I've always seen him very professional very buttoned up\nAnd you don't really know which way he leans so I anticipate he'll do a good job and I had to stay the same for the others after him manny's might be afterwards but after that ...\nSort of typical fashion it's slick leaning left type organizations that are moderate is it only an hour\nTo be honest with you I don't know they need for people for an hour for moderators for an hour well three\nModerators in one facilitating the ... the crowd is part of it in moderation but um [noise] you know we got PBS NewsHour it's not necessarily any left leaning but I Would say it's a it's left of center\nSt Louis public radio left of center I'm you know the nine network definitely left of center so that's usually how we see these debates go as far as moderators are concerned yeah um it's rare that we see like a conservative moderate or do these things\nYeah I agree I agree uh\nAnd I and I don't like I said I don't even know Bush's conservative my sources inside or not I have no sign of a good journalists I've yeah I shouldn't know that's the thing if you're doing your job I should know you all should not know where they lean\nOr you should be confused about it if they're doing their job and that's the problem because real reporting like that you got to be a little cells list you know\nYou have to be selfless with it you know one gives a crap what the report or think they want to know about the facts involved that the ... and ... unfortunately as you've seen with Jim Acosta too many are interested in in in starting their own viewpoints and their own opinions and their own bias into it\nAnd those people are celebrated so it's like a just a vicious cycle it just you know it it rewards that so they want to do it again\nAnyway so we'll we'll see a goodness meanwhile MSNBC is trying to prop up desperately beta O'Rourke Robert or work he's got that CNN town hall tonight listen to this ridiculous headline\nBeta or Rourke campaign has transcended politics to become something of a political cultural for not phenomenon Mm [noise]\nLike his car transcended the road when he was driving drunk and almost killed a bunch of people and then try to flee the scene according to police the record that he denied it in a previous debate that none of the moderators questioned him about\n[noise] [noise] [noise] wow\nI uh they're trying very very hard to making the thing to make them happen I just I I I don't know [noise] he seems so a fake or\nNot I mean there are Democrats than I Do like he's not one of them he just\nSeems incredibly fake I I just you know and and that makes me think Claire McCaskill\nI think if she wasn't so focused on retaining power\nShe might be nice [noise] I think she has the potential I think she's got it without that you would that you would you know that you think she might be nice you might get along\nWith her but my gosh just sit here and go well they just committed fraud what what did they do they recorded me saying things [noise] was it [noise] yeah okay so how was that fraud they recorded them okay well Missouri's one party consent so what was friday went about it\nDo they miss represent you know they recorded exactly what I said and prevented it wholly accurately\nHow is that fraud well I didn't like what they did\nThat doesn't constitute fraud though they're Republicans I don't even think James has a party affiliation Josh Hawley did it Josh Hawley doesn't actually I don't even think know James\nBut I think that they would probably prefer you don't get in office so again I come back to my original question how was that fraud aside from the fact that you didn't like\nIt senator crickets maybe some of the media can ask her about it like an hour on the way with a [noise]\n\nWhen he fell\nYou want to listen to all three are ready to go out [noise] downloaded\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by a recruiter\nHe wouldn't eat running against John Ashcroft and they made fun of John Ashcroft because he covered statues boobs some stretches are pretty realistic\nApparently that one had some realistic attributes on the ... area as well [noise] anyway so he is because he did a bunch of publicity stunts and all this stuff so he is like actually he marketed himself as the Trump of per rump\nBecause that yeah\nHe's a ... that's how we marketed himself is the is the heat that the Trump of of a PR romp and that's how we was introduced that he that he nicknamed him nicknamed himself\nThat so [noise] okay he's a Republican isn't that the ... the reason that the lyrics to the little drummer boy what\nYour ... [laughter]\nHe wasn't it didn't name that isn't that the Taliban was from or something but I think that's why named himself that white ... thought the Trump the Trump from per romp drove ... because I think he was from a town called ... I think\nI mean hell if I Know anyway but that's what but people don't want a Democrat so bad they'll vote for a debt Republican ... you're right came\n[noise] I mean that that a bit so if [noise] he wins I mean clearly [laughter]\nYou're a horrible person or one of the worst people ever\nOr if he wins in what what do they do I mean unless it's a weekend and Bernie's type thing I don't know I you know I don't know\nWas somebody what's been met who's the natural successor of someone like that in that position but whose it naturally go to I'm I\nActually don't know normal I Pretend to\nAnd it's Nevada in that one district I mean it's\nYeah it's up to them I mean he's like so he's still so far ahead of the Democrat like the Democrat I don't even know who the ... and they don't even name and he so unconstitutional conflicts has really been there like even care about that guy that did ... going to win [laughter] I didn't even care to name him it's like nor macdonald wrote this\nPassed away a couple of days ago and people know this is well known in the community that he's dead yet they would rather vote for Republican did him than any Democrat right now the ... well [noise] unbelievable [noise]\nThis is weird it's weird\nI don't know I just I don't well I don't know voters can decide what they're going to do I so I don't know who's going to replace them\nIf he ... I mean obviously I think they'll have to he'll be on the ballot if he wins um ... I think different states have different ways of handling it but because it'll be on the general ballot that will be at all the polling places\nAnd vacancies ... well I mean I Would imagine it would have to be a\nA I don't know if the governor gets involved and then uh the governor has to appoint someone or do they have a special election like what happens then\nSo that's what they'll it's kind of ... it's it's ... it's a little unclear so I mean it's just gonna [noise]\nAh well and I think that the I guess maybe the county's determine I mean it or you know the ... they'll they'll have to pick some sort of replacement but I just think that's hysterical like the Democrat can't even beat a dead Penn [noise]\nMy gosh I just I just I find it funny this whole thing is crazy this whole thing is crazy are moving on I had to share that with you because I was there is a caravan of growing caravan moving away from Honduras\nAnd I don't even if they were if they're fleeing violence I don't know why they wouldn't just stop and you know in Mexico and entered Mexico I don't know but the president has said look if they you know if you don't do something about this on the calls the borders\n[noise] it's been growing the\nUh [noise] I Would I don't know how many people are in this caravan now but there's a lot of discussion about it it's almost I mean I and and if I don't even I don't think that they've been there in Guatemala I don't think they made it to Mexico but they'll probably make it to the border just in time for it\nElection day which grade job I mean I'm totally fine for that because that's just going to motivate more people to go and vote against amnesty and vote against really bad policies that don't do anything for the sovereignty of America or for citizens et cetera et cetera limited government all that jazz\nIt that's just a big uh I think I think it's going to coincide and it'll happen if they if they decide to have a big standoff that's just going to work in Trump's favor\nIt's I mean that's all it will do you see you're gonna have Kevin all you're going to have this great job dumped so I really don't want to discourage this I just wish people would be safe but for all the Democrats who think that this is going to\nBe some kind of big optic that's going to go against Republicans for the midterms these individuals' apparently don't understand how anything they don't understand voters\nSo there you go I mean they didn't notice it is what it is what it is so we have a on\nThe way a Kristin Davis is an insane story let me just get you have to speed with us So Adam ... is given a toilet candidate in Nevada and they're a\n\nChristian Davis and is uh she she works with lack salt and she's you know they're in the obviously in the middle of the campaign or David ... was a ... they were they were out in an event and she was targeted by a Democrat operative\n[noise] ah [laughter] so I just didn't like that [noise]\nTraffic accidents are rising in states legalize pot\n[noise] well they say don't drive or crash risks grow ... doesn't make any sense to me the insurance Institute for highway safety found that people who took the reefer recreationally there apparently hitting everything [noise] [noise] [noise]\nOf the national Transportation Safety board is you'd several recommendations they said in pairs drivers really\nLike driving thirty in the fifty but I didn't think they run into stuff\nWell that's not what they're saying they're saying they that apparently cannabis makes you worse than a woman driver I don't know yeah they said they said that it's a stop it [laughter]\nDon't drive all high [noise] oh my God it's like with alcohol you can drink alcohol but you're not going to drink alcohol and then

they did everything better I'm Astros fan I'm pissed at Joe West 'cause he caught because he cost us to runs ridiculously but I Can't say oh Joe West costs\nI shot which is the bigger crime do the job west call or the fact that the baseball open and shut case in less than a one day when five teams are talking about Spygate you\nI thought what they were worried about was that the Astros if they if they say that the Astros cheated in some way that the Astros win three in a row\nAnd then they would have this being written about for two weeks but that's what I genuinely think they they were worried about they didn't have credible evidence I'm not saying that there's no signs being stolen and I'm not saying that the extras of the only team to do it\nI don't think it's as if ... is agree just spiking okay Spygate this is not Spygate to electric ... but what was good in that\nPatent that idea patent pending patent pending\n[laughter] but the idea that the that the Astros did nothing they were trying to shovel that under the rug it was like it was like an Alex Rodriguez steroid investigation shoveled under the rug all over again like it just it just seemed rushed\nIt takes them

never happen in Cleveland it would never happen in Miami but here in LA it happens\nHe still has not met the media talked to fans done anything he promised well I'm going to talk at media day he comes to media day and what does he do we talked for eleven minutes eleven minutes so you got to leave him wanting more in a whole crowded situation\nThis has not gone well it's not going smoothly and he's

liberal is not a Laker totally wind just first playoff series always going to win his first rang a pretty much tonight within the first three minutes\nOf this game I have to admit LeBron James became a Laker\n[noise] [laughter]\n\n[laughter]\nGot in on me Chris\nWeber's ripping off it was close getting ready to go bad I like that but that moment many called time out and said hey I got you\nSaw the reaction on social media the reaction where suddenly LeBron James became the number one trending topics were the red Sox are clinch in the world series or to go to the world series\nAnd we have a Thursday Night Football game and the electricity that came through the television told you okay and told me the bronze a Laker now now this is the moment he's now a Laker but just a number of people\nThat decided to flip on their own and record the introduction in Portland\nAnd this isn't a staple center hey let's wait to hear the home crowd this was he's on the road first game as a Laker and my timeline was inundated with every I could probably put together a full three sixty\nOf videos from every section in that place that appeared on my timeline of the brawn James introduction and the crowd reaction in each section\nBut that's the whole thing is that you can't quantify a moment like that\nYou can say okay once again it's one of those things that happens or doesn't happen and it organically I think you could say after that\nYou know yeah the guy's a lake or an outer layer and we watch the game and he's extremely involved and engaged with his teammates where we expected but this was this was the moment where it was okay now he's a Laker does not going to be when he gets them in first place not going to be when he gets the play offs\nAnd he's a Laker now and now I feel like the season can begin and I'm I'm ... I didn't know it was going to be the first game when was it going to be if they start out six and six is it going to be ... got to be fired and everybody's blaming LeBron James and we're covering up everything when it comes to murals and pictures in billboards from abroad\nKnow it'd be it'd be came and it happened in the first three minutes of the first game well you know there's\nJust some degree here in Los Angeles has become the if the guy go studios that there there is a percentage that wants to see that early season struggled see exactly what happens how quickly do they record on water more players that they don't particularly think that the system or the ... hour not I think everybody's waiting for him\nTo you know we'll be be fickle add to fate beside of this team evolves what loop Waltons fate is all of that you know the question of what to address them as coach Luke whatever you know based on their\nTheir existing same draft class in the same things so you you look at the way this rules and and as much as we've always said hey\nThe NBA season doesn't start until Christmas well it's it's different animal when you're talking about the brawn James coming to a market like Los Angeles hungry to get back on top after a couple of last year's and all the organizational turmoil and all the last thing\nThat was done at the front office and the bus family and everything that's going on that you're looking to rebuild and reclaim your place in the NBA and yet there's a little bit of a shot in front of people wanting to see LeBron James struggle\nPerhaps even fail Gary Wright say it and getting out of the gate and then losing game on will give people a thousand words and a couple of minutes on TV to start doing just that\nTwitter at how about a fresco Mike

Boston went on in his back in the world series\nThey play the Dodgers\nKeeps the tempo mix the temple more up tempo because lawns was going to be running things as they come in he comes in for re John Ron do it's a different team Lorenzo and liberal on may be better when they're not on the court as much together and you saw tonight Lorenzo ball came into the game when LeBron comes out for the first time because the ball needs to we said\nThis many times the ball needs to go through what brought Lorenzo bobble loses effectiveness because he's the guy that needs the ball most of the time to be effective\nBut what bronze going to be the one grabbing the rebounds take it up court and starting a break or getting up he needs the ball in his hands so he can do what he does best and that's either\nHit hit a fade away get to the ram make a big past he needs the ball lawns though is not going to have the ball enough to affect the game so he's maybe better suited\nComing off the bench but this is certainly a unit that can push the tempo and score points and not only be hey you're the second unit comes in well not just you know playing at an even zero sum but we're adding to our lead this is going to be a huge\nFactor for the Lakers as a season gets on your already have abroad and Brennan anger who's going to have I have a big year you got called well pope I think he's going to have a big year to they have enough you should be thinking top of the western conference western conference finals that's the ceiling and what realistic expectations are for the Lakers well we talked about it\nA a bunch of coming into the preseason yeah the warriors you have the rockets last year and then you had three through nine three through ten essentially the same thirty five when Los Angeles Lakers team got deeper it's it's a curious mix ... to start but they'll find the roles and and as we said LeBron James'\nCoach GM whatever role you want to ascribe to him\nEventually he's going to shove all up and deal the guys he doesn't think fit\nAnd you're not going to see this twelve and if the man run a is it going to be together that long especially if he sees where there's obvious need for improvement so when we look at the the western conference overall it looking at all just leap frog a bunch of those teams just by adding LeBron James and that seems\nFairly a certain to occur I looking at Minnesota wondering with Jimmy Butler how long\nWhile he's on the court and they didn't make the trade or you think you'd figure out a way to make that happen before but we talked to\nA region which our tour guide crime butler and he does that it was like you show up for work until you're working someplace else and right and that's what he did he came out and he he played a good game uh they got lost but I think they're good and they were a number four seed last year had he not gotten hurt so looking for more of the same\nOut of them uh and then you you mentioned the pelican so I Would put him in that you know top for top five and then curiosity as to what happens with the Houston Rockets and whether they can sustain for a for waiting to or whether
