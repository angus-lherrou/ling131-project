down all the big news in the NFL coming up in one minute with Jason lock and for CBS insider but first let's check out what is traveling with the cars in DC [noise]\nHeaded out gentlemen all patriots\nWere playing big of a shell [laughter]\n\n\nRadio now is Tom Brady five hundred career touchdown pass say is just the third quarter back to reach five hundred ... the only one to do it with one team that was also his Seventy first different receiver that as a new NFL record he passes Vinnie test diverting that made it\nThirty eight seven teams give me thirty one Seventeen sending Michelle then added a thirty four yard touchdown run but as you just mentioned left his well for the second time this season\nAnd they are reviewing this one if it stands now in the extra point is good it'll be thirty eight twenty four we'll get back to that but to under two minutes to go in this Thursday night matchup action on the diamonds\nBottom of the eighth inning of China's ravine Dodgers with a fine nothing lead over the brains in game one of their an LDS game one of the LDS in our park earlier tonight brewer survived the Rockies three two and my ... walk off single and the tenth inning\nGreat news there is a quick way you can save money switched a guy go go to guy could I comment and Fifteen minutes you can say Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance\nAnd a quick note from the NBA thunder swing man Andre rovers and suffered a setback in his return from a ruptured Patel attending he needs surgery he's going to miss an extra two months guys\nRight thanks DC we're live from the guy goes studios were Fifteen minutes can save you a Fifteen Percent or more car insurance more information visit Geico dot com so we're going to get a patriots victory over the coach right now thirty eight twenty three\nOne twenty seven to go in the fourth quarter meanwhile the Dodgers on top of the Braves five nothing is the Dodgers back in the eighth inning ... has just tripled\nTo the wall so the Dodgers on the cusp of adding get another run in game one of the LDS they're taking your touchdown off the board here they are yeah look how upset Andrew Luck yet oh I Can't pass by statute don't touch down for me\nOn hold close though at stake three sixty five\nYes ... down at the one yard line rather than in the end zone so now Andrew Luck and the Colts have their touchdown taken off behind ... uh watching this one intent Andrew Luck is just going to go rogue and call a a a ... a hundred and twenty pass\nAttempts in the last yeah he's going to go rogue look look look what what is the coast on the last two games they've gotten down by three scores and then Andrew Luck is great I mean really that's who the guy is\nHe's great for fantasize ... he's awesome I Love Andrew Luck and fantasy but in the NFL he's overrated\nBecause you can't win games like this you can't win games we have a bad first half of your throat pick and you can't get a team in the end zone it's nice look\nHe just buried or on air Ricky Rogers caught a touchdown and I want to have the day a hundred and five yards to scores it looks like a great game from Andrew Luck when in reality this is what the guy does not you you can\nTalk about how it came down to the uh big Frank right call last week going forward in overtime and they're not going their way\nBut the bottom line is remembered that like many colds games they got down twenty eight ten no money with house money at that point that game was over but here comes out I don't know what it is because Andrew Luck does it more than anybody else in the NFL certainly when you get down big\nThe possibility is there for players to have big games fantasy is that why is because we're playing Louis were up by five touchdowns and and you know you go up and down the field get a couple of scores but Andrew Luck has made this into an art form what part of this that\nGoes into and not to exalted him and put him on a pedestal but you look at that roster around him it's been awful like even this year trying to rebuild their off at one time and they will be put five guys healthy he's played behind I think it's now thirty nine offensive line in his career\nAnd that number might actually be low I I Can't remember how recent that piece of data is you know all sorts of stuff swirling around the dome but the the fact of the matter is once he had you had to pay him and you get into that next contract if you haven't already built\nThe weapons around it becomes difficulty why can't stay on the field and even when he does get your number one no he's a guy that kidnapped some big explosive games you can also be disappeared ... been obese cheer you you're missing jak go Doyle but you brought in Iran figuring you'd have a dual tight and\nKind of operation rolling well he's been dominant\nBut again a lot of this coming in\nGarbage time now for fantasy owners were for better because all of a sudden you start looking at fourteen point game again with the minute eleven laps you never know crazy things can happen but what you're looking at the the colds overall you just don't have a lot of talent on this team I mean some of these guys were looking up where like I ... no idea\nAndrew Luck is the garbage and then a new superhero\nI mean [laughter] you know again they don't drop two balls for Brady\nHe completes at least one of those drive for a touchdown you know the numbers look even more quality so I think that's who they are and that's who they have to be\nJeeze lock and for CBS Sports NFL insider with us here on the Jason Smith show with my Carmen now you you said the magic to see a couple of seconds ago because\nI got to be on the first five weeks the season there is no game I Want to see more than Jacksonville in Kansas City can he's this mess in the NFL Patrick holds against the one defense I think in slowing down\nThis is just fascinating and I don't even need the gym and Randy ... back and forth just what's going on the field is incredibly fascinating\nYeah my my my buddy parks got used to say at all the time styles make fights you know and and that's what would this really sets up to be and I you know I think it all live up to it or that there's enough\nIndividual talent that will be matched up on one another um that uh I think will make this something close to a must see TV for sports fans it may be a snapshot precursor of the AFC Championship game\nAnd uh you know you've got sort of the duality of uh what can we see homes do under pressure we got the first taste of that at mile high and to me ... that test\nAnd then what can Blake bottles do with a million years to throw the football which is usually what he needs and and the Ford starting to show a little passe rush\nFor the chiefs um and just in Houston can still revved up every now and again off the other side but let's face it that's a pretty toothless punch list effects\nThat given up a lot of points and a lot yards and we're not talking about it or harping on it because the offices overcome it but overcoming it against Jacksonville um is going to be incredibly difficult so yeah I think that's a\nYou know that that's that's a they're playing again in January of any of us are going to be a surprise\nLast one born and raised in a week mark nailed the former game show host now defensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens yeah Perry Baker me you'll do farm in ... I'm a lot better yeah nothing\nYou you know how it is I mean you you want to show complete respect for your opponent and that's at the fed says riding incredibly high right now and he doesn't want them to fall in love with their press clippings or think that this one's going to be easy and let's just roll balls out there\nAnd go I'm because that's not how this leak isn't Baker Mayfield is super athletic and he flashed a lot of good stuff um but you know right now the ravens are really ah bringing it on the fence and they get\nThe guy who's been their best corner for the last decade Jimmy Smith back from a suspension and and that they don't need 'em but you might not even be on a regular wraps because that's how good everybody else's playing right now I'm so yeah uh the the ravens are only about nine points in the second half all year that's\nThe worst in the NFL league average is forty five their average in three point nine yards allowed ... and the second half the league average is five point five\nI'm so they're they're living right um and they're making great adjustments and and you know wink is a big is a big part of that so we'll see I think they will be better at home again\nAnd who you know ... feet under him and he'll he'll give them a different look inside the pocket and outside the pocket but or that the game they're even have to win and I think they will win\nBomb on Twitter had Jesus to lock in for that Jesus\nWalking for currently with CBS Sports but expected to be a manager of the Orioles tonight\nAnd he's not in a couple of days I'm good [laughter]\nI'm Out [laughter]\nNo [laughter] no I don't do it [laughter]\nThat\nThat those genes look he does a bee more opinionated sports cast all this stuff podcast rather all the data that done a good idea I dig that I'm good [laughter]\nGreat stuff there from Jason ... more of an honest reaction it is it is or how about a fresco Mike it's wall and do the\nJason's red show where the man is reading my garment coming up next a decision that was right on Monday Tuesday Wednesday is Tripoli writes a night we break it down coming up next this is radio\n\nEven if you're a big time basketball fan there might be a few facts about the game you don't know why did you know the first who actually peach basket or going to war basketball is bounce you're then the cold one or the players can run as much as four miles during a game well here's another factor you might not know that's actually really helpful if you need to buy a car\nTrue car also helps people get used cars that's right true

states\nWent\nYou were wondering what are our radio ads [noise] download it now [noise]\nAt the end of the season we throw that out there because you they know exactly what this is going to do to Clinton Herschel is this going to make them happy you know it's going to piss them off it's going to really pissed them off and now the Dodgers have realized in the last two years they won the ... going away when he was hurt for a large part of the season\nThey one Ninety two games this year where he was their third best pitcher\nMaybe finally they're coming around what I said I started saying Eighteen months ago and that you got to look at a future without him he's over thirty he's got a bad back do you really want to be hooked into him for another thirty million dollars for each of the next two years after this\nThe Dodgers doing this specifically to prompt attack\nFor the playoffs now and to get him to opt out what to push him to opt out to make it seem like it's his idea that I should leave the Dodgers obviously I'm not the guy there anymore and they got other young pitchers that they would pitch instead in fact I'd be willing to bargain with you that they would start if if Walker bealer didn't have to pitch\nThe playing game they would say Clinton you're going to pitch game three in Atlanta\nFor ... you know we're going we're going to go first to end game to reuse gonna go game one he's great viewers been fantastic we'd rather have you start in Atlanta where you have a lot of experience I guarantee you that to the Dodgers would've done man I Love your do you like that\nThere is you're just trying to throw up some some hot takes\nGet some people fired up here are on this Thursday night at how bout of Prescott Twitter by mail read swollen dump a you know what would the wave dealers pitched down the stretch\nCould certainly see it but there there's something to be said for having the longevity in history of ... coming in the number two especially coming off the this kind of euphoria of the story you got from here tonight\nThat you can capitalize on that in front of the home crowd as much as you may say hey the young pitcher\nLike a veal or needs they the home crowd\nI'm up to believe the you know ... you don't know what you don't know [laughter] at that age and you're just going out and you're dealing one way or another with ... I think be having the the Dodger fans behind them that important one for this Ron and if they win at all\nOr prosper is in my you're going when they when it all that they come calmer heads prevail because\nYou have plenty of money to spend okay and as this is not a cash strapped team we're not talking about\nHaving to go to hold pending at any point with the Dodgers based on payroll dynamics like we had in Tampa and like you'll see in probably a few other major league cities is coming you know uh they they had a couple of brain structure ready to roll things out and crush I think\nThere's there's something to be said for getting through as we talked to bill ... LA Times last night of making sure he stays a Dodger\nBecause as you get older you know it's hard you know pride screwing with you in terms of whether you're still the number one guy or not and that's something pay that they\nAte a Clayton is going to have to reconcile in his own mind but the idea being that I I think he sees where this team could now it's doesn't have to be on his shoulders because for many years was\nWhere you didn't have enough not to have a number three you know anything I think he's probably looking at this as much as you want to be starting in game one looking around going we actually have a team that can contend for a long time\nI hear bill Plaskin when he talked about hey the Dodgers ownership wants late in ... it's a big deal for them you know they haven't had\nThe only on one guy go into the hall of fame being a Dodger ah for his whole career in the past Thirty years all the other guys or Brooklyn they have different uh\nThings and and and different paths and and they don't go and just as Dodgers all along I get that but this is modern baseball this is baseball in two thousand Eighteen and beyond this is what's the best way for us to win and keep winning\nOver the course of the next few years that continue to rely on clean ... hey it's great he'll probably go into the hall of fame as a Dodger but you know your piss them off by starting ... sure but he doesn't have any missing them off\nBut here's the thing is he he doesn't have to lift his team on his shoulders like you used to in the past right you're not relying on him he's now a second or third cog in a pretty well oiled machine\nThat's a pretty good advantage to be working from hey Clayton even if he is Ninety percent of his former self what the money is immaterial it's not your money still getting spent\n\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Twitter at how about a fresco Mike at slowing down\nThe Jason Smith show with my van ness run my Carmen hello Newman pushing them out pushing them out so have they knew they would piss them off pushing them out most of\nOut we got more on this game more on the other\nIn game after game but that's supporting cash for the offensive line to the weapons around and it's been garbage for the better part of his career\nSo I Can't put it on his feet defensively it's been a train wreck they'd been atrocious and now they're trying to climb out oh but they're already paying a boatload of cash do try building\nOnce your quarterback has already got paid very difficult proposition Jason Smith you'll find that out when you have to rebuild around stabbed Arnold and his second we're\nRebuilding around them now have you would only give them a lot of money at all that that's my point you're trying now imagine what

just the third quarter back to throw five hundred touchdowns and for breeding Gordon is the Seventy first different recipient of one of his TD pass is that is also a new NFL record\nThen he just have already through three TVs to Seventy different receivers TV twelve after the when\nThings like that milestone and so forth it's there's so many people that contribute I just think all the people that

[laughter]\nThat was a great role I Want to go I Can't watch that movie now\nClarence tell you something a so tonight major league baseball playoffs we had the LDS we had the Rockies and the brewers and the brewers when on a walk off in the tent thinning Dodgers shut out the brave six nothing left more than ... game coming up next our but just really quick\nA lot of attention the last couple of nights on both pending right teams that are going to the bullpen start games and finish games many\nTeams are doing this because they don't have the starting pitching the other teams do some out of necessity some because they like the matchups better and that's what the brewers did tonight was pitcher bullpen game and it worked out for them\nJennings two runs it worked out great but to push our conversation\nFrom last night with the bullpen game the he's tried to use and that was a success for them because they went five innings and gave up to run for re pictures five innings do runs you'll take that for many starting pitcher the AIDS didn't have any good starting pitchers less so they wanted to open game but really in the playoffs every game is a bullpen game\nBecause starters come out so early now that every night you're going to the bullpen way earlier than expected if you get like the Yankees got four innings outta Louis several Reno last night and it took him out\nHe didn't give up or run you know one hit what they had to take them out of left what your runners on him because he was in trouble yeah job yeah it was only a two run lead and they had to\nFigure out what's the best way to ... maneuver and manipulate the rest of this game and it was let's go to the bullpen it's not like the regular season you're starting pitchers aren't going to get well they gave up three in the first\nUm and then they get in trouble in the third I'm going to leave him in and hope they settled down no you're out of the game you're relying on your bullpen every single night which is why you see things like\nHey Andrew ... coming in the game and the fifth inning for the Indians well that was a watershed moment three years ago well you know what now what happens all the time Josh later comes into games doesn't matter ninth inning eighth inning some intending to every game is a bullpen game because they're used in a large fashion every single night and now they'll\nGo to Joey shut shut genes or game to go back to a traditional started Fifteen game winner three five ... your right\nAnd you're playing with our money because you got the first one [laughter] so you moved for now and it's it's a trend that we'll see continue derided by many mocked by others color me intrigued\nBecause I'm always curious to see where the economics and the metrics that everything clash and cause a little bit of chaos and certainly I Can't wait to hear the unions\nThoughts on this boy he continue and we go into the office\nYeah you ... to get more people pitch and what do you care middle reliever they're going to get paid\nWhat does it matter I mean look unions can be upset all they want to if you're you're\nMarginalizing the importance of starting pitcher but there's no law that says they got a pitch five and I don't really baseball it's either you got to start to ... you can do whatever the hell you wanna do that's true\nBecause most starting pitchers don't go five anymore at\nAll [laughter] Twitter at Alibaba ... might get swollen dome that Jason Smith show with my bank friend Mike Armand we got more on the Dodgers big victory they hid in the Clinton shot in game two

I mean look at ... yeah he's we easily in like a greyhound I mean they look at them\n\nYou have no idea what to do with that too you know well well he has nothing to say I have to I Want to say one thing I can move to something that I'm not sure is really don't know how far I Want to dive down this rabbit hole well I mean I I think sometimes you got to rely on faith\nI got to be like a Harrison Ford the Indiana Jones the last crusade to take the step on the on the the\nOh look it's actually they're okay All right maybe that's what you need to do if you are higher in the hospital tomorrow night after having come into the doctor's gonna go oh it's hard to know\n... I Can't believe you fell for that old trick\nAnd I would say doctor Hebert I'm very sorry if there was an old come outta trick I think we would have heard of it was very well version well read for the old old canoe trip Brady alright number\nSeventy one different receivers number five hundred tonight you saw how easy it was nine for not on the opening drive a journey the questionnaire multiple receivers mean Edelman\nDropped a couple early in this game that took away from that perfect quarterback rating for Tom Brady but certainly spreading the ball round but then you have a guy like Sony Michel hanging out in the backfield\nReally changed the collection of as often as much as I Want to gush\nAbout Gordon and the return of Edelman whatever the fact that you actually have a running back and loved James White but he's more receiver than anything sure you got a guy between the tackles that can rip off Fifteen yard runs\nAnd boss through the tackles and get to be outside that's changing how defenses have to look at things and that they haven't had a guy like that\nIn a long while I mean look Arab want I guess when he was at its best but beyond that what what are we going back to\nTen years before since you had a running back really of that ilk who also catches the ball out of the backfield\nMakes us off in that much more difficult to defend right you got ... running on one side taking the top off ... sprinting through the Senate to feel like he's a kid in a spring daisy patch\nIt gives them a nominee spring day how many times did you see I'm really weren't there is nobody cover ... keep it out of them so there he goes in and that's part of that is Josh and you've got to pick your boy you're right but you know but the\nThe thing is to go a step further with is is that\nYou can say is Tom Brady still the same quarterback without Julian Edelman and now Josh Gordon because look at the games he has had up until this week he's got some good games but has he been this explosive no this is the first three hundred yard game\nHe did throw to pick spot his three touchdown night tonight he threw three touchdowns last week but this is a big night this is ten incomplete pass it\nThis is his best passer rating\nIn weeks and it's a night where he gets back a guy who has been very good for the past years and now a new dynamic threat in Josh Gordon can you say Tom Brady was still the same guy I Wonder if without these got what kind of season he might have been on an on an arc for if you didn't get\nEdelman back now and Josh Gordon\nRight well we can do that with any quarterback that has a bunch of ... running around but you never had to worry about that but you know what ... might as well you always had an adult man or a welder or one of those guys that when you say if you if you had you had in Hamburg well yeah but you but you always had a guy that was a safety valve that would catch eight balls and keep the chains moving\nThat guy was missing for the first four weeks of the season now he's back\nAt Josh Gordon for whatever years for however many weeks that task you still get it out yeah I I like to camp\nFox Sports radio the Jason Smith show
