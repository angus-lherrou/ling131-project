{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "He's kind of a guy that you just take for granted he's going to throw thirty five to forty touchdowns a year maybe the safe will be good maybe they won't be but they're always going to score points you ever noticed his age never comes up\nOn my Tom Brady right everything is Tom Brady and how old is that what what you hit forty is that when we started talking about how you'd never know you Drew Brees just right there and and we're not really going on he's old\nOld Drew Brees is also playing in his living room he's been playing indoors for most of the good ... hey this is what it's like it's like watching Drew Brees is like it's like he's just comfortable there is I in my living room I don't think Drew Brees even knows what real ... feels like it's just grass ...\nWell I mean he hits upon here in San Diego for a bit yeah and well obviously now I now in New Orleans beautiful thank you can run it can be the governor of the state of Louisiana Governor Bobby governors got a bad connotations and the walking dead the governor you know that's that's not it's not good yeah people not like in the beginning of this next uh walking\nIs Rick Grimes is vital episode yeah I'll tell them\nHey grimy the big as he made it I mean is that the British it eight seven you know he knocks on the door to see a cure nightly and sing to her and ... and ...\nA liquid and Jonah butter off that's what happens to say that on there they butter okay ah\nYeah the biggest bit of cultural um currency is when did you stop watching Walking Dead like that but the thing that like ... it's not when did you used to be when did you see Hamilton now it's when did you stop watching the walking dead oh I stopped the season and a half ago you seem cooler I raised my hand and I said never started\nOn the on roads you governor\n[laughter] that one right Ah yes you're right Patrick ... correct yes I'm just going to a lot of give it a little path but um so\nThe thing is you remember about Drew Brees and this is really interesting 'cause it's like I said so many things which kind of taken for granted\nBut he is extremely lucky because if you remember earlier in his career when he was a quarterback in the San Diego chargers he was going to be there next rate quarterback he had had a couple of great years he was drafted in the same draft classical Danny atomic thing but then your talents in went early first breeze was the next pick and he played really well\nThen he busted up his shoulder which are buddy Sean ... put out a tweet about that a little bit earlier\nAnd yet after ... after he busted up his shoulder of course the the they drafted Philip Rivers and and you know charges haven't really looked back 'cause you'll feel rivers is probably going to the hall of fame too but\nWhen Drew Brees after coming off that injury only two teams wanted to sign it the dolphins and the ... that's it nowadays if you have an injury like Drew Brees it doesn't matter because of medical science the advancements\nSeems to be lining up to ... we don't care if you have an injured we'll we'll take a long slow you're a great quarterback he had four or three really good years he was if he if that happened now and Drew Brees is gonna be twenty four years old coming off the years he had and he had a shoulder injury and a team of the turn the page\nThere would be twenty five teams saying we'll give you whatever you want but back then because this is you know almost a generation ago in in medical terms\nYou're talking about in two thousand for two thousand five words yeah we do know that you can really play again we don't know we don't we don't know we can take a chance on you two teams wanted decide Drew Brees bad is it\nThat that's amazing to think about how his career could have fizzled because if not for these teams there's only two out of thirty who knows of even get another chance maybe your stock market bring you as a backup you don't know about your arm of you may not get a chance to play anymore we almost could have missed his career because of that well you look\nAt even on his own team right teddy Bridgewater are being there and what he faced in terms of just is lake in his day to day life let alone getting back into a football uniform for Drew Brees and you know we talk about all those great for the past that you know ten to Fifteen Years prior\nWere lost and their careers were done right the most famous always is Gail ... an injury that would have been kept him out ten months now ended his career so you look at Drew Brees you had two opportunities and while the saints ended up using correctly\nAnd getting their man and well not only is done great things across the the landscape buried in terms of his charitable output is dominant for two decades\nTwitter out how about a ... got Mike swollen dome it it's still all New Orleans and all drew\nBrees another part of drew breezes past will honor

congratulations on this record you've done it the right way all your hard work and dedication have paid off\nYou and I come a long way since this picture back in two thousand when you were in college and I was in my third year in the NFL so way to go proud of you good luck the rest of the war\nSo there is a message from Drew Brees yet the picture he does hold up as one of he in a very young Drew Brees are kinda just looks like a young pudgy high school friend guy I mean that's kinda what kinda what Drew Brees looks like a ... shirt and a little bit of free safety in high school I Would have won a contest to take a picture with Peyton\nManning I went to his passing academy [laughter]\n\nSo that was pretty interesting idea look Peyton Manning having a lot of fun there at the beginning I broke you broke your right which one which one oh alright greatest thousand days of young Peyton Manning's life\nBut one thing to get to on Drew Brees which looking back at the entirety was gr we talked about\nHow close we were to not even seeing it happen because not many teams were interested in him coming off his shoulder injury back in two thousand six is that before this you know paint talks here's a picture when you were in college playing at Purdue and Joe Tiller yeah go boilers and uh\nIt's it's\nTwenty years ago almost but I vividly remember how good that Purdue team was under Joe Tiller because if you think about the evolution of the NFL what what's all the rage now and in college specially spread often says right everybody runs some version of the spread\nAnd especially in college look I see I see a hurry up versus the spread all the time of Syracuse because\nWhy did teams do this it's their way of competing with teams that have better athletes that are more talented if we give them something different to prepare for we can level the playing field and now every other team runs it you see some kind of spread off ... everywhere sometimes to hurry up sometimes it's not but Purdue was one of the first teams\nTo do that and this is Twenty years ago and breeze had a phenomenal career throwing the football at Purdue and became a very high draft and now he didn't go as high as you expect what do you think Drew Brees he didn't go well I was still there but why somebody thirty thirty two so that you know he was not tall he was only ...\nThinking about the angle he's thrown from in the entire career goes back to the federal magnetic football game oh quarterback with an angle\nHe's going to have neck arthritis bad oh there's no question of his life 'cause he's he gets that extra inch by tilting his head up a little bit\nBut you think about that and that was really those were the first types of off and some are saying George Tiller was the guy but Joe Tiller was one of the biggest guys to run that spread off and this is back Nineteen Ninety eight Ninety nine two thousand well but the bigger thing\nWas it was happening and other conferences and the big head it was ...\nWas it was three yards at a cloud of dust\nStill at that point that that's really you're talking about Big Ten foot pole evolving you look at those three years under breeze you had a Rose Bowl appearance mix there in but you want to have a little fun with numbers any here we go\nNineteen Ninety eight first year starting for Drew Brees almost four thousand passing yards in the Big Ten for the boy was thirty nine touchdowns twenty interceptions\nNumber two on the list you went to ... guess who was number two passing in the big\nDown there Joe germane\nOh gee I said you know as you may I add all three thousand three hundred or a you're talking about six hundred and fifty yards difference\nYeah on a bill Burke third from Michigan State number four celebrating University of Michigan\n... Nineteen Ninety nine different breed could barely beat out drew and South Asia ... loved drew had so much that he was the number one recreate country well when he was on baseball cards as a member of the eight now there's going to Asia was all that\nUh Drew Brees ... year two thirty nine hundred yards Kurt kitten her number to University of\nIllinois whitener twenty seven hundred passing yards ... twelve hundred number three Antwon Randall el number for Tom Brady twenty two hundred another battle a final year three thousand three six hundred sixty eight yards\nThe next player on that list and I don't do this just for northwestern but shows the separation 'cause we're still reticence to adopt such a a type of op eds that coup stock of northwestern twenty four hundred\n... have a twenty three eighty nine for ... you're talking about a full Thirteen hundred yards more just the way they ran that opposition may joke teller a household name and at a superstar and Drew Brees got 'em up into the beginning of the second round\nIt's winter ad out on a fresco Mike had swollen DOMA Jason Smith show is my car and we got more on drew a brief more on that and that will be playoffs coming up next

touchdowns was law you know you can look at it now I Do a twenty five but you know two thousand six two thousand five twenty five touchdowns was a lot well it's like when\nPeople try to use a old quarterback ratings and arguments against\nIt well depending on how able to make more intense how will the quarterback reading that you're talking about from three years ago yes applicable to be talking about from Fifteen Years ago no it's a different era and the NFL I see what you're doing I'm going to step on your foot [laughter]\nBut so back then member breeds was coming off you know coming off a really good writer he was twenty six years old but only two teams were interested the dolphins and the ... and the dolphins\nDecided Dante colpepper was there a guy and I have very thankful for that because I don't know if they're just going to want to game\nGoing up against Drew Brees and Tom Brady for the past Fifteen Years later when many anyway no we didn't know we wouldn't want just a little bit about ... maybe it would last more and gotten a better quarterback sooner oh wait wait wait wait wait wait now or in the middle of Aaron Rodgers career now so\nNow a days people would say well the shoulder will be fixed medicine medicine is there we have no\nCompunction or worry about this because we know and we are confident in medicine teams are confident in medicine they understand when they talk to doctors\nThis guy's gonna gonna be able to come back and play be this kind of player but back in two thousand and six when it was still okay the shoulder injuries like this we haven't really seen many teams can say okay the doctor can tell me but I'm just nervous about it because that general knowledge is not what you think it is so many teams backed away we almost didn't get Drew Brees his career because what the\nDolphins said okay it's breeze or colpepper they said were signing colpepper so if it's not the saints and Drew Brees then maybe he's out of football for a year when he comes back he's a backup maybe he never gets a chance to get there with a sharp Peyton\nFor the restaurant doesn't get to play indoors for the majority of his career and throw the football all over the place and spray it like it's a hose I mean so many things that almost didn't happen because of the time\nFrame in which that occurred and had the same not done that we might not have had his career\nWow look at all those yards easy throws tonight a Redskins laying down a in a big Monday night game and Drew Brees the pageantry was pomp and circumstance the gift cards and certificates of authenticity and more game balls out of this one given away then I think in the history of the national football sweater\nHow about a friend Mike is slowing down the Jason Smith show in my car and coming up in one minute why was Drew Brees able to succeed the way he has the last Fifteen Years out of them will tell you but first the cars is going to tell you what's trending PC\nI write a couple of things turning the saint of course the forty three Nineteen whenever the Redskins the big story here Drew Brees becomes the all time passing yards leader on a touchdown passes sixty to eighty order\nTo trade ... Smith he also finishes the night one touchdown away from becoming just a fourth quarter back to reach five hundred career passing tests towns also hadn't big news and the game that was a blow out the red Sox beat the Yankees sixteen to one of the big news\nHere's the rock star with an IT sad [noise] and he's right there at twenty three right down the line toward the Carter hooking\n[noise] and he has four of us cycle for me [noise] second time in his career has the\nRed Sox radio but according to the lions sports there oh that is the first cycle ever hit and a postseason games and that was Brock hope that the answer to your trivia question\nAnd all the red Sox lead the series two games to one the winner of the series will face the Astros who completed a sweep the Indians they eleven to three\nOver in the national league gave us the Dodgers advancing they outside the Braves six to ... when they're in LDS three games to one\nLA advances to face the brewers in the NFL Championship series and the Dodgers had a Clinton Kurdish I Will start friday's game one in Milwaukee against the brewers great news as a quick way you can save money such the guy go go to chi chi dot com and then Fifteen minutes you could say\nFifteen Percent or more on car insurance guys\nThanks so much DC that line from the guy goes studios that Jason Smith show with my man friend Mike harm and I\nReally that's really hard to believe in the history of major league baseball nobody's ever hit for the cycle in a post season game before\nThat's amazed every night we see something new but that's but that's something that I I I think we've been ... baseball for over a hundred years now and that's never happened and sound like a cycle is so so rare it's not like well getting a perfect game in the world series like okay well this happened once before it's like for the fight we got a bunch of those\nAnd you know well over a hundred years that's never happened\nThat's amazing I I Can't I Can't imagine that that I mean look not I'm not saying I doubt the Elias sports bureau but I just I just find that that is so so hard to think that you know even though you know hey growing up all the baseball history I knew you know you knew all the\nHay who I had the record for most total bases and the game show Ed Koch um who almost threw a no hitter bill ... led the first perfect ... Don Larsen you know I knew all that stuff growing up because that was what I did in the seventies and eighties in ... but that's I never remember coming across someone hitting for the cycle and the post season but I still can't believe that never happened and then all those\nNumbers got obliterate it oh yeah I don't buy and and the the Google machine now tells you very fast like I just started finding beer well like this this particular do you bring up right now rock holding the three hundred and twenty fourth player in baseball history to hit for the cycle\nSo not necessarily I mean not common place but certainly ... enough circumstance but first in play off I guess you got guys that do anything\nI don't know this could be you know more along the way you'd you'd stumble into one what's interesting and it was a an article in the Boston Globe yesterday say so within your kids are struggling should the red Sox going ...\n[laughter] yeah yeah so [laughter]\nI joined her out of out of ... that that's a headline\nThat Jason Smith show it might harm in that when you're hiring you don't want to waste time sorting through dozens of relevant resumes you want an efficient way to get to a shortlist are qualified candidates that's why you need indeed dot com posted job in minutes set up screener questions based on your job requirements then\nMeet the media you'll hear from him now the NFL's all time leader in passing yards and one touchdown away from the magical number\nOf five hundred but in a game that just concluded moments ago the Boston Red Sox\nEked out a thirty seven to one win over the new the red Sox beat the Yankees tonight [noise] sixteen to one to put them one went away from the A. L. C. S.\nO. too fat [noise] showing at a ground ball website backhanded Bible verse jump shot\nThrow over the first stretches out at first and the ball game is over the Boston Red Sox ... the the one the three of the scale the as the red Sox leads the division series to be the one hand he wants more when to Fletcher [noise]\nNobody I on the call rock hall the first player in baseball history\nTo hit for the cycle in a playoff game for for six tonight with five RBI everybody in the starting lineup had either a hit or run or in RBI many of them had at least to this was the night\nFor the red Sox they are now one that went away from the ALCOA as to what starting to gain a lot of traction is chattering and and and TBS was talking about this apparently and now the Yankees are having to answer questions about it is that\nThey're estimating that Louis Severino who got lit up tonight did not have is normal bullpen before the game and that potentially could have contributed to him being off tonight because look Severino couldn't get out of the fourth inning uh gave up seven hits six runs up I'm surprised that\nAaron Boone left him in there for the fourth inning considering that Boston was hitting him pretty well it had been two innings of runs the stuck with a guy when hey you got to figure out a way to win this game and go to your bullpen instead several comes out for the forty gets at heart of the game is over\nBut Severino said no head as normal bullpen the Yankees said no Severino had his normal bullpen everything is okay a boy I'll tell you what I I picked the Yankees in the beginning I'm not going to go away from an Alka sixteen to one is just one game but boy it feels like the Yankees are close to melting down and they just had a curiosity\nHere that it was harder to broadcast\nYeah uh you know seven forty starts I didn't start warming up till seven thirty two man seems seems like something's amiss there yeah I'm going to be a bullpen coach bullpen catcher Aaron Boone who you've been critical of in terms of his uh\nOh laissez faire more just a a at ... manager in that sense you just got an error you've just been the guy the guy\nBut the thing is is that this is what what what baffles me is that\nI don't think this would be an Aaron Boone thing because the Severino would it look he warms up the same way all pitchers are all creatures of habit they all have to say I want to the same way as a scan you are and what they do you know they're not all Clinton curse Shaw where\nAt six forty to why I'm doing this and it's six fifty one I'm doing this what it's like hey\nYou know if if if you look at first pitch for her shows after seven ... he's going to boycott\nTell what but we've seen that right we we saw earlier in the air yeah couple of those now a circumstance kind of things where you could just see how salty one\nWhat most pictures all within a couple of minutes one way or another of doing their long toss whenever they whenever they like to do to get ready doing they're running in the outfield but wherever they are doing their those creatures of habit so to get out there eight minutes before to warm up\nAnd that's kinda weird but the Yankees say we had normal warm up time and that's I mean if I feel like the Yankees are close to melting down here\nAnd not that this will be Aaron balloons fault but certainly Aaron Boone would be the guy who at this point if I'm Aaron Boone things are really bad\nAnd this is where a coach or manager needs to step up say or do something to take the pressure off of the team\nSometimes in basketball it's when a coach gets thrown out of a gang doesn't need to get thrown out of a game but he does it take the pressure off or he said something really outlandish just to get people talking to him listen I'll I'll handle this I'll tell you this team is overrated that were playing against was suddenly over and over rated and that led to the guys basically\nGet back to what they're doing everybody leaves them alone and they can understand why we're back to playing baseball we need to do X Y and Z\nThis is where Aaron Boone needs to do something like that because this is what the good managers do this is what the good players do when they step up about you know what I can handle this and I'm going to do this I Need to see something from Aaron Boone where he's going to help turn the page on this to tomorrow and\nWhat I if I'm Aaron Boone right or wrong about Severino I Would be I'd be defiant\nI Would say you don't know what you're talking about this is ... you know you have a problem with me come told me this is my team on this and then Severino can back off and do his own thing the rest of the Yankees back off and do their own thing because we're Arab needs to say okay this is what it means to be a manager I Need to do something like\nThat yeah even if it doesn't make any sense and get get bumped in every way shape or form possible because of how you know responsibilities are split up across the board yeah this is one where you you've got to ... try to figure out how you take one for the team I don't know that you can\nIn Atlanta she's always find a way but there's controversy in the way to do it in this particular case I mean unless you want to just light up you go to one of your hitters and just say you know we had one of those early situations we needed to hit from you I'm gonna have to throw you under the bus for not not ... with writers and scoring physician or\nWhatever the case you Carlos are away with that yeah it's a exactly but you have to go to one of them because\nWhat's ... what I mean it's it's out of his purview right that's in the bullpen that's being managed away from the manager\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox Twitter at how about a fresco Mike at swollen DOMA Jason Smith show with my car I mean I'm just throwing out drink Carlos ... there's certainly many other players you can throw out there but I was

office of wine to play out even greater than I ever could have imagined\nHe passed nearly Ninety percent his completion percentage tonight twenty six and twenty nine for three hundred and sixty three on three touchdowns shrank when Smith with three Kansas for a hundred and eleven yards and two touchdowns and guys mark Ingram in his return from his four game suspension scored twice on the ground

play man ... who has just as interesting story getting where he is now as Drew Brees did Zack welcome to the show\n... guys quite a night\nYou got hey first didn't want to do for you I Want to play do you want to listen to what your call sounded like of Drew Brees as a record setting play you want to hear it\nI Would I'm a little curious\nOkay [laughter] I go unless you're I think thirty eight yard line first intent to forty six remaining St lead it twenty six [noise] free just completed passes the different receivers already starts in the shock\nOn\n... what do you think of that well\nIt's a look at it as if it's a special moment it's a special moment Jews are very special person to me and uh by your are playing with him in New Orleans or some of the greatest and my wife and uh if I couldn't be on the field and when that happened but I Can't imagine a much better thing to be able to do than to\nTo try and frame it uh you know for the future and and the special moment almost got choked up\nA almost got choked up on it when I realized that it was going to happen not only that he was going to break the record which was coming but that it happened on a touchdown that he was going to get the the the moment that he deserved to get a after doing that\nYou block for him for twelve years before retiring becoming the scenes play by play man earlier this year I could tell in your voice there was a it got close where your voice was going to crack a little bit emotional it was awesome what's going through your head as you as you're calling this play\nWell again you know it's funny I mean the concerns you have is a fight about like are very different than they were ahead of the player ... we're up in the booth counting yard all night long right and\nThere were afraid that we're going to miss that or it's going to come on a true yard playing rock going to be sure we're right on the members and\nParanoia the whole night and so when that happens um wouldn't catches and there was actually true or broke a tackle a and\nWhen when he broke the attack on your side was going to score I think there was a realization they're one of the gravity of the moment the importance of it and how special of a of a moment that it was to be a part of\nBut then also there was this like realization that man you couldn't have written it any better and if you if you have the types of emotions that I have about Drew Brees if you have the type of respect that I have for drew you just couldn't\nAsk for it to be any better in any more I deal and he deserves that and I think it's kind of all that rolled into water it's the gravity of the situation and it's also just how perfect it worked out for him\nWhen I was the question of you know did you start stripping things over the course of the week as you're in order to rent for parents and his game\nYeah uh I I wrote down about forty seven different thing when that happened and you know what you realize when you do this job for for a lot of people who don't know I mean this is my uh ninth play by play a game called in my life and\nSo there's a lot of things aren't learning as I go and I think that I was a great lesson of uh you could never script\nThe moments you could never script the excitement the real the real\nEmotions that to happen you know so yeah I had stuff written down in front of me and I didn't use any of it I thought about it for about\nTen hours a week and it was a waste of ten hours 'cause when it happened to our diet and try to cry\nWill do that and I mean in luggage a fantastic calling it captures everything and obviously as people know the backstory of your career with New Orleans when I go all the way back with you to northwestern jak I'm I'm I'm a northwestern grab a little bit older a and grail view yeah exactly do cats big win this week\nUh and now I now Nebraska coming in but you know you take over for a guy who'd been there for three decades\nSo how much you lean on on what you knew Drew Brees and and the organization to helping form where you were headed you know as you try to figure out how you would call games\nWell yeah I mean I'm following Jim Henderson\nDid it for thirty two years and and he's just an icon in or all that\nSo many incredible Bowman certainly I mean it was the entire reason why I wanted to even try to do this because when I thought about the

believe it's an OB history but with Drew Brees being the order of the night the thing that\nTo look back at his career there's many different angles to look at it and not just to play the old where does Drew Brees rank\nAnd come on Mount Rushmore eighty seven percent of Ninety nine out by\nRussia ... now but what's that have kind of different conversations about him was to get along you know a big long and winding path to get to where he is right now in the national football league and we're going to get to the injury aspect of it because he almost miss Drew Brees his career entirely which will get to a few minutes but\nOne thing that portends a lot to his success that people forget is that it's been a long time she's been in college\nBut breeze went to Purdue\nRight around the turn of the century and Joe Tiller his head coach who passed away a couple of years ago I vividly remember Joe Tiller taking over and turning Purdue into a really good football team in the Big Ten\nAnd what Joe Tiller did was start running the spread often\nAnd nowadays everywhere you look at college football somebody runs the spread often look in the NFL teams run versions of the spread often bought back around Ninety eight Ninety nine two thousand two thousand and one you didn't see it a lot and especially in the big head over to where it was three yards in the cloud of dust what drew but Drew Brees\nBecame such a household name in college because Joe Tiller put them in that spread off and this is where it was like that he wasn't really the the godfather of the grandfather of of the spread often but he really helped bring it to the\nPublic consciousness because before that it was just something that you know teams in the whack ran or some smaller schools out here would run it\nBut once that happened right around the turn of the century spread officers became okay well let's see if we can do in that same Brad forgot into a spread off ants and suddenly guys running Heisman Trophy side of the spread often but similar at Purdue that was it ... hey Drew Brees became a national name and\nThe charges went back to back with a baby and Tom lives in and Drew Brees and the drafted into the I mean that was that was it two thousand and one that they could have set their team for for Fifteen Years\nYeah you look at the ridiculous nature of that draft all these years later right it just to have that opportunity you got one in the hall of fame and the other and you might as well just put the code on him let him walk ended I\nEspecially now that he got a certificate um authenticity for the hours and say well we'll get into that I mean everybody here you know what it what do you have to go get it from the official [laughter]\nI I just don't understand the the whole mechanics of all that was crazy how the official white gloves to Iran I mean it started with a foot bulldog jak would you go back in and look at what he did at Purdue and how much more prolific they're passing op eds wasn't anybody else first year as a starter six hundred and fifty\nMore yards than Joe germane of the Ohio State university second year as a starter twelve hundred more than ... ...\nOf the Illinois fighting on it and then Thirteen hundred more than ... who stock is final year of the northwestern Wildcats before becoming a second round pick with Perdue and you saw what they were in his final year they went to the rose bowl\nYou didn't have any of that with Perdue and it and it was one of those just like you'd have to totally change up your practice schedule and try to learn when you're facing\nYou know a a triple option off at like ... job killers off it was unlike anything else being run and to make that so it was like we're going to do our best or going to have enough quarterbacks to compete with this because most of your guys that you were trying to bring in Raul skilled position guys on the offensive\nSatire things because you were really just looking for BP guys to guard against the run\nAnd Ron Dane and what you were doing again seems like that and she's dead\nNow you're looking at OK well we've got to try to cover these guys and it didn't quite work eventually the rest of the big ... and the rest of the nation went into the same boat but I remember those off as that was fun to watch but a pain in the neck 'cause they started looking like pat twelve games and a
