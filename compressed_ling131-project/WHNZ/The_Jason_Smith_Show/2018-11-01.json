need\nUm [noise] um\nI mean I I mean honestly they would I think they need what two seats to take control and the Senate or where it concerns\nThe house it's\nGoing to be a lot tougher for for that for Republicans here to hold that off\nAnd there are a lot of very very competitive house races that are Republicans are having to defend\nMartha McSally for instance is one uh there are a couple of different districts and some California districts to where you know they've been kind of red previously\nSo and looking at all of this um goodness uh\nI just don't know if I'm when I Want to be as generous as as Nate Silver there at five thirty eight\nBut for instance I'm looking at some of the Senate stuff in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn is ahead of us ill president by five points but he is starting to tighten up cruises\nAhead of ah Aurora in Texas but or work are starting to tighten up because he's got celebrities he they're pulling out all the stops all of the stops ah Martha McSally a veteran\nIs behind she's trailing Kristen cinema by six points which to me is insane\nAnd it's even further tightened when the Green Party candidate the spoilers put in there\nIn Nevada Senate\nDean Heller has and this is all from the the the bump came from the Kavanaugh stuff he's got a slim lead over Jacky Rosen a I don't believe the Emerson pull that had him up by seven I think it's a lot tighter than that or the ... the average show to just to point\nJust well within the margin of error or some of the local ... some of the local polling in Texas has Cruz head of better or work but uh the internal ... from what I Know are a lot closer than ah what is being shown\nIt's a lot closer or they had that\nThey that some of them show ten ... some of them the other show five I think it's I think it's a lot tighter than what people believe or what people are even comfortable\nUh with [noise]\nAnd these are these are some of the ah these are some of the Senate the some of the Senate stuff\nThe ... going down the line here we're our cp shows\n\nThat thirty two of the house seats are are classified as a toss up I mean it could go either way a hundred and eighty nine till geo pay two hundred and four till Democrat and\nGoodness it's going to be you got to have two hundred and Eighteen teacher majority it is going to be it's going to be tight\nStood as a lot closer than people realize everyone needs to go out and vote\n\nAnd this um [noise] I mean again the significance of losing the house I just can't I Can't I'm a\nEmphasize enough how important it is\nTo make sure that you that you go out and vote and that in that at particularly with your with your um uh if for anything else other than the house races I've just been looking at all of this data here because it is I mean it is\nIt's just going to be tough there's so much there's so much at stake I just think of energy I think of it I remember the house controls the power of the person there is a\n... there's a lot there or additionally Democrats I mean Nancy Pelosi already wants to become speaker of the house that that'll again that'll be a fight on the Democrats' side\nAnd if\nThey even pick up one seat in the Senate\n\nThey'll try to do that you're you'll you'll look at an impeachment they'll try to find something they wouldn't even have to have anything the whole point is just lost there they'll find something they'll do something all the gains that we have received jobs more of your up more of your taxes refunded et cetera\nAll of this stuff or you're going to see rolled back and it'll be disastrous it will be absolutely disastrous\n\nAnd so that I mean I'm just I'm telling you what [noise]\n\nSo I Hope that people uh I Hope that people really are paying\nAttention to this because it's a house that both on impeachment Senate conducts but house wasn't impeachment [noise] so it is and that and that's what they've all promise to do these are just\nTheir words their words very important

concern me the absolutely most ah and ah\nOil and Holly McCaskill\nAs well so far they are that's I think the closest I've ever seen this race um everything that I look at in\nTerms of all of the aggregation of polling shows them shows it to be incredibly tight right now\nAnd [noise] uh it's yeah it's going to be it's gonna be tough [noise] and all of this roof\nAudio somebody Nineteen by the way McCaskill\nI sometimes I don't think that speaking of senators I ended up close race I don't think that she quite understands um her voting base listen to this\n[noise]\nAnd\n[laughter]\n\nMm yeah but that's the problem that I don't I don't believe in term limits and here's why\nAs having a conversation with this I don't I absolutely do not believe in creating a law for term limits do you want to know why because voters that your responsibility you are the term limit vote them out you were the term limit why the hell would you would you give up your authority and power\nYou are the term limit you are you you you I'm so tired of people feeding their sovereignty over the process to more government\nVoter I'd term limits are literally the big government response to stuff you don't like\n\nAnd I think she's a career politician\nAnd whether it should be a negative thing no one should be taking their ideas of a career into serving the public but this it was always supposed to be a
