I mean I don't know see that's why you have people who are very very trained and\nAnd all of that stuff you know that can see that [noise] oh\nSo very very we're gonna we're we're going to watch and ah bring you all the latest developments ah\nIs this as well um we have over ... maybe there's going to be some other things that we had a that we can get into a because there's a lot of other headlines out there as well as the caravan et cetera um but\nVery very I I'm\nInterested in the construction at that because they can tell a lot from the construction of it as well I had another friend of mine who is a veteran who was a bomb disposal tech who was saying that and I'm going to butcher this horribly actually message ten but he's not I don't see him on line I think he's traveling um\nI he had said that at some point you can determine uh what kind of ... because there are certain sorts of trade you can determine what kind of training they had and all kinds of stuff just by how something was wired and\nWhat they used and how it was like really really into it you could easily tell\nI've learned and that makes for a meal\nOf course I so what do you what do you make of this a first off let me just to get let's get the thirty thousand foot view ... what do you make of that I mean these these these pipe bombs I guess there are I I Know at least someone that was sent to CNN has a pipe bomb\nUm when you see the images are when you hear about this the items the devices that were sent what does that tell you as an expert what do you get from that from from what you've seen so far\nWell first things first you have to treat everything like if it's a big bomb and they can go off at any moment see evacuated record in baseball you push people away a certain distance or your blast fry collateral damage radius\n'em and you judge that um will basically you get everyone out of the building is what you do then when you have an opportunity to a movie called prosecute or factors potential bomber id you look at audio visual clues and accused the sea okay what is this announcement working or cannot due to the feed it\nLooking you're the only picture that's available a bit obscene personally\nAnd a hundred percent yes thing and that's the best part to be an expert is the no you're not one I'm new look at it and say okay well there are a lot of things here that just don't add up so out of this person isn't a very good bomb maker or as a hoax bomb or something that's so sophisticated that looks very different than what you would expect\nBack and tell you that my gut feeling is the picture of a pipe bomb that we're seeing probably could not function as a bomb but there isn't enough there to say that definitively\nAnd fortunately the right people are working on it and we'll know very soon what it is a perhaps maybe once a apprehended individual will know more along the lines of if it would have ever been a bomb to begin with\nYeah and and that's that that's the other thing that ... and I love how you know that because of your training and your expertise in this because I looked at it and I thought that was like a bomb but that's all that's all I Know I the wires and I'm like that looks dangerous wouldn't want to touch\nBut you said something that really intrigued me that it that it that it looks like it it may be perhaps it the way that it was built it wouldn't explode and people keep telling me about the amount of explosive material that's important as well or explain a little bit on that if he would\nSure at first thing people need to understand is that fireworks kill more people every year than any other type of explosive so big things can come and small packages without being at looking at the picture without much the skill of by other than what looks like six steps it's a pretty small pie\nOr I'd so you can't have that much explosive material in it to begin with if you have water is going to both sides that presuming one set of wires is going to other components like a power source so if you're trying to contain that within an already small pie you're kind of reducing the footprint of what the explosive material would have within that pot\nOne thing you have to have is a certain amount of over pressure in order to uh to create the explosion in other words if you are for lack of a better explanation tried to ignite explosives in a container much larger than the explosive itself\nThen it'll do what's called low order or it won't actually blow up so if there are components and things within the ...\nReally what you get into as it is not a very well made bomb if it is a full of bombing could explode and there was a good chance it wouldn't explode even if it tried but all that aside\nWe see something that looks like a bomb middle of the people that are nationally known and political figures it needs to be treated that way until right Julie found out otherwise\nRight to you it doesn't look in ... and one of the reasons I asked Mrs because a friend on one of the photos there there were reporters at both the ... and again I none of that was confirmed it all just some reporter speculating that oh I don't know if this looks like the ISIS flag or look what this looks like and then they were kind of everybody was kind of debating as to what they thought the skill level was and therefore\nHow much of a danger that individual posed because I mean is that is that a fair assessment to think that if it's a more sophisticated looking device in the person's probably more dangerous than just you know some uh what what might look like at first glance some kind of not job more on that\nCan't is not really doing anything well thankfully\nIt it is but at the same time that doesn't really get us anywhere if we sit here and go oh this person is it that dangerous next thing you know something blows up because we didn't read it that way so it's not I mean I understand people's curiosity and understand the need to talk about this even this early\nBut at the end of the day there are things that appear to be bombs making their way all the way to the repetitive in some cases a very influential people\nWhich means this is a dangerous person\nUm you know it does it take a rocket scientist\nTo use a gun make a bomb\nUse tools that are out there really what it comes down to the Turing and the sad things finding bad people rooting them out every hitting them and getting them away from any opportunity to do things like this I mean you know we talk about firearms all the time\nYou can't legislate your way out of an explosive threat all the walls are already there it's illegal\nBut at the same time all the tools or very most readily available for recalls of our First Amendment we can look up ways\nTo make bombs legally so at the end of the day we have to rely on law enforcement to do their job support them raise a flag when we see something suspicious and then will dissect how effective this person was or wasn't hopefully not very effective at all\nOr maybe by the end of the day that person can be apprehended um so you know what if we're talking about this picture that surface than what looks to be a bomb\nNo it doesn't look like something that would be very effective but if you compare bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan the more simpler bombs had a higher success rate because if you've ever played the game mousetrap more complicated than is the more can go wrong\nOn so there's a lot of ways to spend this and look at it as a bomb tech looking at that picture my expert opinion would be this is probably not a full of explosives device but there's no way for me to make that you know with any confidence without being right there on it and having more information\nWell Johnny we so appreciate your service has always been also your expertise I'm On this as well because I think I think it's an incredibly valuable uh and appreciate you giving some of
