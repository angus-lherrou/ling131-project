AOL [noise] downloaded that\nTalk horse trending\nThis league has been quarterback driven for the better part of a decade now right a decade and it's never going back to the running but because they get hurt too much it's always going to be quarterback to them and and the giants\nBecause they had done everything right for four years figured no no no we know what we know how to do it and now they make the bad decision they tripled down on fake one Barclay was the right guy meanwhile all they're going to do is say boy look look what's going on with us when we think and we really need a quarterback\nAnd that's the writing you're not going to get a trend transcending figure at that position unless everything else is working in harmony and you've got so many other holes as we've seen over the course of this year and they ... every week we seem to see a I'm a new gaping hole or open up for the giants but you're also looking at it it's not just saying do\nYou look at it only other quarterbacks that are playing pretty well like Allen got no chance\nWay behind that buffalo off at the line but I'm a few occasions that he actually gets tied to deliver the ball down the field you you shrug your shoulder to add this guy can be pretty good once they actually build something around you\nLook at Josh Rosen in Arizona not a lot of talent there yet\nBut the same thing the off that's why it gives them done the Bali through jak Christian Kurt to get things started last week\nI mean that that's what you're looking for you're looking to open things up and push the ball down feel something the giants can't do it and do it next year I mean Ohio they drafted I mean you while they were drafted number one getting to the point where like I'm\nHearing you just take direction that going forward and we're going to see what's gonna happen here\nBut this this is this is the part I don't even know how well the giants evaluated the quarterbacks in the offseason\nWhat did they don't bother how much did they evaluate Arnold and Rosen an album these guys like gentlemen was advisory at that because they are a big thing was boy the browns could take and this was where the browns theory the one thing that would have scared that was\nThe browns pick one in four they could take Barclay one\nAnd then come back at it for a good quarterback whether it's bigger Mayfield or Josh out or because they ... they were split on may feel the Josh I'm there like both these guys they could do that that was the one thing the giants were freedom I guarantee you if they took Barclay number one giant straight out of number two\nBecause they're not going to spend all kinds of money on a guy who's not they would have trouble I'll Barclay was our guy were trading out we're still going to go all in on the line man\nAnd part of it is it's going to be a pattern right they bring him in and the idea was that he'd be able to fix what ails you with these parks and with the top but it dominant at times running back and take one Barclay to take take up the the workload and instead we've seen you live there's no masking\nWhat's going on with Eli Manning at this point no matter how many good skill position players you have and we can blame the bench of why we can blame a little bit of the ... the fact of the matter is you can't cover up\nFor the fact that you light doesn't push the ball down feel there's no threat at all in opposing defenses are starting to ... even the eagles\nTonight they they weren't coming in and the position of strength and being the eagles defense that we've seen in the past what they can pin their years back because they know that you like eight can't move and be he can't go over the top idea\n[noise] Fox Sports radio the Jason Smith show with my Carmen

dealer's choice is on the ah the interview tonight you're ready I'm ready Hi what do you want to talk about first hotel uh and the electric electrical fan photo walking off the field at halftime you lie manning where you live ... offensive line\nHope's Boy a what's behind door number for a\nI guess all the above I'm\n... and they're all tied together uh obviously to to one degree or another but this really hasn't been a functional off and they had a few plays they strung together a week ago against Carolina\nThat provided some points one of them being a you know sort of a gimmicky gadget play wrote all\nReally had their best down feel for the entire season and unfortunately he was throwing it not catching it ... they're not a good football team they're not close to being a good football team\nAnd uh they they you know may have you know for themselves as to what they thought they were going to be this year but they didn't fall\nA lot of people around the league and and it starts with the quarterback but let's be real they they pay him big time money to be a big time player and he hasn't been for a long time and we can point to being on an address here in there and\nYadda yadda yadda but they they tried to prop him up as much as they could this off season with a running back on the left tackle and a fortified office of line\nAnd a commitment to run into football and you are still not very good\nSo what do you go back to that devaluation was it just you love the snake launched so much we're building statues ... who was blind loyalty and we got to give you one more rounded see if we can resurrect him that sure most humorous to a degree\nI Know this is an ownership decision I'm a law they hired guys who they knew through the process we're willing to go along with with what\nOwnership felt like was the plan of of due process and that did it have to do with football to some degree sure did it have to do with business and sort of where they were as a as as an organization more than anything else yeah they they were not\nComing in this to tear it down and rebuild and do what probably um again to a lot of football people was painfully obvious\nThey wanted to keep it together put a band aid on it we're paying the lie a lot of money yeah we sat him for one week last year for Gino Smith but what we made a mistake when the fans and the media reacted how we treated Eli we ... we were treated\nAnd rallied around him and said our apologies and now you know we got to try to win something in the next couple of years with this guy\nAnd we want to put some ... and the seats and we want to contend and compete or at least give the appearance of such\nAnd not start over with the young quarterback and um people who went through that process uh they felt like that was the only really way that that ownership was going and if you didn't want to go that way then this probably wasn't the job for you\nThe other thing the giants are going to have to deal with following this game is over do back in junior in the big thing is before half time he walks off early while the giants often says still on the field this on the heels of him being fined by the team for his comments an interview a few days ago how do you think the giants deal with this latest chapter in ...\nI mean I don't know like [laughter]\nCan't get them to catch his marine passes I mean we can talk about it he left\nThe field early two weeks ago they said you know if they told the sideline reporter um he went to get an ivy who who knows um\nThey they don't have a functional off fence and it's not because of ... I mean we you know we we he's not the only guy on the team was attacked and then that I'm an object\nOn the sideline [laughter] you know like what\nAre we going to start keeping tabs that like they\nJust watch the game just I mean he's not under intense duress every single for oh I mean there are baseline sort of\nSlants and screens and and you know little we'll routes that\nYou're expected to be able to complete most of the time dress or not that that stuff's just it's a it's an adventure as to whether he's going to hit the guy in stride go look at some of the screen tonight and what it took ... back them just to catch the ball\nLike [laughter] I I mean ... whatever like the guys on that team no where the problems lie in that office and between the lines on Sundays\nPeople are worried about oh del they're worried about Eli\nFox Sports radio Jason Smith show with Mike Armageddon even the guy goes studios I'm a hotline when a CBS board NFL insider\nExcuse me Jason lock it

Nobel jak already in postseason mode oh saying it feels like we're playing Kansas City\n[laughter] yeah I mean look this may not be the last time we see these two teams face to face each other it kind of reminds me of Jacksonville Kansas City the week for the team that wins this one in this circumstance may not be the team that\nWins the same game come January if they do meet again\nAnd going up to Fox for in a week where\nYou know they they still don't have air berry and now they're down in office of linemen and they're not going to have just in Houston and let's face it the last two weeks it's it's it's still been great for the chiefs but it hasn't been easy street it it's it's been tougher to move the ball\nTeams have taken some things away they've adjusted to that office\nUm I think this this kind of to me lines up where this winning streak goes to die\nDoesn't mean that if they host you know the patriots in January ... arrowhead that that it's the same outcome but\nI don't love this situation for the chief as things are shaping up right now with the injuries and and you know do they do do do broke team score over thirty I mean that that's possible um but I think if if Tom Brady is April ... able to score early in the chiefs have to play from behind a little bit\nUm you know I I don't know I I don't know that that you know they're going to put up thirty five\nEvery single week and I don't love New England defense but this is a big game ... check stress them it's a big game and it it tends to bring up the best and the way when\nYou can follow him on Twitter jeeze to lock in for that had Gees locking for CBS\nNFL insider extraordinary all those ... be more than you needed podcast as well the website is the most show as always buddy appreciate my friends on the next week thanks for having me guys who is good stuff and Jason lock and foreign look this is when we get into the conversation which we're going to do coming\nUp next about he lie manning uh sake one Barclay because this is this\nLet's just say you think's acorn Barkley is great you can have him he can give you two hundred yards a total often send a game if you don't have a quarterback you're going to score Thirteen points like they did tonight they never move the ball they were never a threat\nAnd the eagles just roll right over them yes they have all sorts of line problems that's an issue the giants are a bad football team do you think they're going to be great because you have the star power of utilize name say quote Barclay name and OPEC um juniors name but that doesn't make you a great just makes you have three guys that everybody has heard up you have to have better\n... competition on the offensive line to get the best players out your defense asked me better not give up at times but the number one thing is if you don't have a quarterback you don't have anything when you're drafting number two overall you had your pick of four or five quarterbacks at the ...\nThe draft you only got you worked in a get was whoever the browns picked it number one but you had your chance of Darnell Rosen Josh out whoever else you want it these are all very highly sought after quarterbacks\nAnd this is when you go get your quarterback this wasn't a hard decision for the giants you many when you're in your late thirties and you stink for two years 'cause that's what he lies been you have to go get that next guy despite the fact that you live in New York and when you draft that quarterback that people are going to want to know what is he going to start how long have you like in a play\nAnd I know it sounds mentally draining to go we got to go through a whole last season of what is our next quarter back and waiting going to be the store for the giants and the whatever forever reason they didn't want to go through that\nBut that's when you take the quarterback it's not rocket science it's easy all the teams that need a quarterback ultra quarterbacks\nTeams took quarterbacks after they signed guys to be their quarterback the off season we saw in ... Taylor was still where to take Baker may feel we find a gym a carrot we're gonna take\nJosh Allen we signed said we're going to take Josh Rose we give sand bred for twenty million dollars in Arizona for one year you still have to get your quarterback the giants didn't get their quarterback and his and even if you want to say after ... was a breakout star in the NFL one in five\nAnd he scored Thirteen points and he was court thirty points one once in the last five years so there's that has been the last time this is where you're at this is why quarterback is always more important than a running back especially when you can get a franchise guy number to\nKnow you can get away with have again young inexperienced quarterback\nAs long as the other parts are there and you can dress to running back ray you can have the the luck that the the cowboys at a couple of years ago where is he going to be fine to big all kinds of wind and you're not asking jak Prescott\nTo push the ball thirty five times down the field well you're you are needed to do that any hair ... is just as bad\nA discombobulated as their offices I mean how many times over the course of the night either through the broadcast on Fox or on your social media accounts wherever you are listening we appreciate you taking a few minutes with us did you notice questions of quit\nOf the jeep and not having enough personnel to really put a big effort when\nQueen Jersey clubs I mean you look at him over the course of the night well not on to address by way of contrast you like to use ... he's taken a hit part of it is easier mobile\nThe other part is you're just an office of wind getting bull rushed and overall in time and time again so you don't ... you don't have enough of the other component parents to cover up\nFor bad quarterbacks way so heading they called Barclays nice luxury if you have these functional guy that you're not counting on suppress the ball down to feel like you're always going to have to ... you ever inherited the job once he's\nTaken down an ocean is that you know bad\nGuy you know gee yeah you know but the ideas you know\nYou you didn't have enough to cover it up right you thought you could prop it up and Jason walking for what I think really well I was saying you tried to prop up the like and that's what it looked like\nAnd and you make bad choices on the edge of what they're not only drafting shake all Barclay you don't have the quarterback in place for the future is going to do a song and dance on a running back with a bunch of meaningless yards\nThat's all you've got ... got to explain it all went around out of frustration might add swollen dome and therein lies the game [noise]\nThings are getting testy between ... and the media did he have own vacuum juniors back after\nHis antics tonight find out next year ... we\nDiscover card believes anniversaries should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why they think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving them a try discover will give new card members of one year anniversary gift they'll never forget\nAt the end of your first year they'll match all the cash back you've heard dollar for dollar that's right dollar for dollar milk caps and no catches try it and believe it I discovered dot com slash match that's discovered dot com slash match only for a new card members limitations apply\nThose and I know start with loans because lovers makes it easy to save every day on every job working on a kitchen or bathroom right now you can take ten percent off all American only subway tile and enhance the look of any property [noise] by the time by ordering ahead on line and your order will be ready for pickups in Seoul\nSouth by our visit most for post dot com for details so pro now that you know start with low offer valves or ten forty supplies last us only [noise]\nWendy what a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after he said as Sean who's blink camera alerted him a burglars trying to break in while he and his family were home or Shannon who's blink camera caught a thief stealing packages both times blink video clips were sent to police to help convict the crooks\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras or wire free set up and minutes and run on to double a\nBaptist staying asleep in fact according to a national survey fifty four percent of adults have trouble sleeping so what can you do about it take solace solace isn't all natural dietary supplement formulated to support healthy sleeping relaxation\nSolace can help you fall asleep and stay asleep naturally formulated with all natural ingredients someone says not addicted and won't leave me feeling groggy in the morning takes on less an hour before bed and the old a calming effect to this extensively research sleeping relaxation a\nWin\nAlong and listen to our first ...

thanks for that a shining insight to what happened during the game\nAnd how he had to focus at the end on ... got his touches yeah a lot about the end but he got his touches like it's very important that oh they'll get his touches now what's more important you win the game or this or the old old gets his touches because he may say\nHer know that are winning unless you get him his heart you know he was telling you but the thing is you can ... the the thing about the giants oh will back them can play great\nHe's still up that's what we can Barkley can play great still get drugs they still are games that I Would go was I'm not worried about you lie\nHe said that with this faith indeed we ain't great I mean he got testy what the media there at the end what I tell you guys I I'm not sure about the reference I'm not so they ran a little bit for sixty minutes secondhand [laughter]\nThat's what look I coached by you know I go to my daughter's soccer team\nI I I never worry about their effort they run a little bit of practice what they're nine and ten years old we don't really run don't run in suicides up and down the road a little bit I mean that's what the giants it's like I didn't know what they did do one lap around one whole lot in a big one step on third Doug anybody going to cover map [laughter]\nJust coming over on the little en route and you know they ran that slammed the first time what are they going to run this time I don't know a sled you got to tell their looks like the same information that I could literally later it was on top of the other they're all in the same\nThe same play saint play I I really wonder Jordan that you look at where the giants season is now one in five and there's problems with oh Dell and you know ... back here again Andy I Will 'cause he idealized by Dr everybody's\nBattle but that you know if he's going to defend Eli he can't go after all that you know you're right yeah you you lost the ability to go out or any other guy on the squad I only did that categorically just saying I'm not worried about it you\nWill and it's also him say let me see if I can make this less of a controversy but it doesn't matter if you don't talk about it\nOther people are going to talk about it we're going to talk about it shows tomorrow it's going to be in the in the papers the picture as the picture on the back page is going to be older leaving the field before ... getting a pan oh maybe it's a better visual yeah but can you see the fan on the newspaper\nThat's the tough part because that's the dark background was a fan was kind of blue though it's\nThey lose ... but the back page is not in color so it's going to beat it almost looks\nLike banging his head against the painting dumpster I think that works pretty well one will be the big hassle be buyers that you\nKnow [laughter] [noise] so it it's really difficult to be fired after one year as a head coach in the NFL it's very difficult but things could get so badly out of control for the giants\nGet can you see him getting another year if it continues like this there one Fifteen and it's ... ... ... the one thing is that if you lose the players you can be bad but as long as the players play hard for you it's okay it's like you know huge action in Cleveland\nFor players like ew Jackson the parents were just the brown the last couple of years to the last three years that but they like huge accident they played hard for him they try to win games ... Jackson never lost the locker room with the brown that's why hey you know what everybody likes you even ... like we had last year olds if\nYou're going to come back and now here he is maybe buying a little bit of job security 'cause they want a couple of games and now Baker Mayfield is playing well knock wood keep playing well playing quarterback but when you quit on a on a coach\n... it's hard to get another year and that's the big worry about the giants and that's why the whole thing about the lion and being honest with the media is a is a big deal because all the lime in the office of line the defensive line\nOh del sake won ... they're all saying the same thing they're all sitting there going\nMan he lie is just killed us he's been a bad quarterback for two years and still he won't he won't call them out he won't call out the golden boy of the franchise 'cause that's not what's going to be here's the golden boy the guy getting paid all the money to do so much great stuff years ago\nWho's been that bad he could say everybody else thinks what he could say I'm not worried about your life that will play so horribly in the locker room because it's basically patch or was it everybody else stunk but you know you I'm not worried about whoa\nThat will not buy you another year not at all\nNo as what you got some journal the stats going the most recent I can find an article was twenty Thirteen where you'd had ten coaches over a twenty year period so it doesn't happen very frequently certainly we we saw huge accident had that happened to him in Oakland right you went ate and ate and found himself out of a job\nSo it it does happen on occasion and and this is one worry we've already talked about it earlier uh last week where you might have several\nWhat do I deal with a donkey\nAlready and I and go to I don't think so anymore ah here's do do after the loss of the eagles\nThey lose\nHow to turn around\nAnd they do keep keep digging [laughter]\nWhich are holding on to keep going keep going up so he can [noise] there's no way to pull yourself up with the work to keep working out and keep working out of\nI was ... so I was trying to give you an IV 'cause there was a ... is really like a two minute [noise] um\n[noise] my use of coverage for cyclists going there and get an IV be able to come back on a\nSurvey shows who says ...\nThere was a man when I was inside\nThe safety over there if I ran across the food is cutting me off ... very very\nHigh so there's oh back um junior saying I Need an IV looks like he was moving okay [noise] off the field before halftime well here's a\nProfessional athlete finally to machines so he's not going to show any ill I mean it will it humid\nThere even looks like he's like a boxer mhm hurts on against I\nLook back um junior didn't cost them to win tonight he is always going to be a lightning rod for criticism and now this is gonna be like as you've been reading a little bit of\nWhat the back page the New York post New York daily news have out there it's going to be ten days of ... antics what does it mean ten more days of who knows what else is going to do in the next ten days\nAnd how do we get a new quarterback and get rid of Eli Manning and can we get Oregon games on in New York City so we can at least the Herbert everybody\nStay up late now I didn't care about west coast games all these years now they're gonna have to stay up\nI thought you were a giants fan yeah I don't watch the games anymore I just watch her play on Saturday Night for Oregon because that's going to be our\nGuide well the other thing you miss was a rather than keep working harder that will be out of T shirt tomorrow just keep working harder because back and junior said that repeatedly\nI don't know if any other questions came out about his quarterback but certainly the other story that should dominate New York headlines is the clip we played the bachelor like that's\nBigger than a ... but that's that's my point about\nThe over arching point we've had about oh del throughout the show tonight is that he's going to get that kind of attention he's the he's the lightning rod low hanging fruit right by but he also goes out he's a star he's a superstar Eli Manning is not a super star he doesn't go through everybody's got an opinion 'cause oh back um junior is polarizing\nAnd he has to realize that the best thing you can do for the giants is to just not make headlines let the giants figure they're crap out because they got a lot of crap to figure out and don't be the guy that's always saying okay wait ... now I got to stop doing this and go do this before we figure stuff out here but he's not that guy\nThe giants pay them they're going to get good performance on the field they're going to get stuff on the field distracts the giants and and becomes a load of crap\nThey are going to get stuff off the field at the same thing\nSo the giants do what they did when they signed or do back from junior this is what they signed up for it so now you have no choice but to move on knowing fully ... knowing full well that this is how it's going to go no matter what you do with this team even if you are winning you're going to deal with some kind of\nOld held back um junior controversy that is either reporting or unimportant but it doesn't matter whether it's so Dell everything's important\nThat you're going to have to deal with on a regular basis as long as you have him\nWell the beauty of it is the these are cosmetic you know as we talked about over the course of the night you know you you said all the right thing there at\nThe ivy by it or don't that seems to be the excuse that we'll see each and every time we'll see if they go for the hat trick it believes in early\nAnd another game but you know if they're not going to call out you lie Manning's performance what's going to do is get many broke out all of a scheme that they ran out over the top you didn't say hey I I can still run by route you I Can't put it there [noise]\nSpeaking of Eli we're going to hear from Eli Manning coming up next what he had this thing J just read show as my garment Fox
