[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nListen live on the radio dot com [noise]\nOf the reasons I think it's so important to share that story of my Arizona with others around the country it's just serve at a warning symbol for each of you to take note about your changing community\nFor issues not knowledge the changing nature of your community and allowing that it's ... just fill the thing that is created by the national moving a change in Arizona could also be your future\nSang that Christian cinema\nHe wants to represent a crazy pants in Arizona who's challenging ah the ah air force fighter jet pilot veteran Martha McSally man and that's a new video apparently when she was calling Arizona it's crazy that was like her bit that she took all over everywhere\nGood night\nI mean just why\nIf I represent a group of people are not going to go around and tell everybody that the group of people are represented as an example of bad yeah I Know what I mean that's exactly what you're doing\nYeah I agree yeah that's just just not great\nAt all my goodness well not good at all not at all but\nShe's already a fallen in the polls in fact what is that it on the Sally ended up um has not taken the lead I think she's beyond ... well I don't know I think it depends on what what poll you look at what shall it should have struggled to debate though I think\nYeah she did but I I was looking at um a in terms of uh the margin of error for Arizona the last ... I saw a couple of polls were they were tired and I saw some recent polls where she was above and if I was above margin of error is I think she's leading now which they should because for crying out loud\nNot only did emails come out where this woman invited which is to her anti war rally but also she hates all the people that she wants to represent I guess my goodness so coming up there was a Democrat voter fraud rings discovered in Texas\nAnd it was picked up by CBS News in Dallas it is unbelievable happen in Fort Worth\nAnd now for people are facing felony charges or busted by age ... nobody wants to talk about it it was ... and ... and one of the defendants was a part of ... counties a Democrat Party\nOh\nSo we should talk about this a little bit because nobody really wants to have this conversation this is on believable by the way the story voter fraud does exist but it was a paid voter fraud rings\nAnd we're going to talk more about it as well I'm also coming up next our man the uh latest with the with Saudi Arabia and that Washington Post journalist ... we're going to discuss that as well we got back on the way a\nOut gay wedding cake fight in gay wedding video fight\nWill have that and one of the women beaten by the biological male who I'd identifies as a woman speaks out and says it's definitely not fair she was pushed out of top three because of this man will discuss that as well don't go anywhere next ... hours a day to show coming up in a minute [laughter]\n\n\nWent to work cutting him up apparently right there on the table while he was alive\nWhich that's not an interrogation gone wrong and that's not an accident if you if you do that and apparently that was\nThey state it was at their account is that it was seven minutes from the time that he entered the consulate to that moment so that's pretty quick dang now\nThey are nobody knows whether or not he was just it 'cause he was drug whether or not he was unconscious or whether he was just paralyzed when he was dismembered\n'em and\nWhether as to why\nAll of this is coming out now I think Turkey's kind of wanted to show that look we're serious we we know that what happened were not lying about it this is it\nAnd if\nAh that forensic that Saturday forensic specialist a guy who was just numbering show these body and the allegations\nThey Middle East I apparently is a um isn't there a publication that turkey was also giving us information to as if he did in fact if he was telling people to listen to music while he dismembered body\nAnd well then I guess they would know that what are you know turkey was corrupt and they're telling the story\nAnd that botched what was it the interrogation gone wrong would not be that would be incorrect and it would be alive at the Saudis\nSo that's where it gets that's where it gets interesting it was also will even or or worse New York times said that they had that one of the suspects had ... that turkey identified\nWas a frequent companion of crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who is the Saturday leader he had been seen of getting on and off airplanes with him around Europe photographed\nStanding guard when he was in Houston this year and Boston and the United states\nAnd there are apparently others linked by witnesses another records to the Saudi princes security detail\n[noise] now\nThis I mean it gets bad\nI mean what he is I mean if he was behind it why would you use people from your inner circle that's the one question I have 'cause that's probably the dumbest thing that I've ever heard\nWhy would you use people easily identifiable from your inner circle\n\nAnd why would they think especially in Turkey that that would not come out\nI you know I don't know\nMike Pompeo went over there to discuss and here's what I find really just nauseating from some of these I mean the whole thing's nauseating but I just add to the knowledge or some of these journals 'cause my ... pale went over to get answers\nAnd\nYou have some reporter stand up pictures of ... and smiling and laughing with the crown prince as if this journalist wasn't murder it's remarkable it's embarrassing it's bad policy et cetera it's indefensible I didn't realize you were a diplomat\nWho the hell are you again I didn't realize you were a diplomat maybe he's trying to\nGet answers and if he goes over on hold a gun to his head he's not going to get answers that way I Do want answers or do you want optics\n\nGolly and how they got mad at Heather Nauert because of the photo that she posted a when she was in Riyadh\nBut\nOne of the uh didn't didn't Saturdays they had come out and saying that it was it looks like an interrogation gone wrong and that could have been a rogue agent isn't that one of the things that they had put out there\nThere a possibility that they didn't know these guys did it I don't know that's what I think I Would I mean there's a possibility I don't know if I\nHad I I don't know my level of difficulty believing that though\nI mean if they are\nI I don't know\nI mean and they said that it it it just um [noise]\n\nTo say I just I'm not sure I just don't know if I buy that\nSo it's a very now it's a very precarious situation between the Saudi Arabia and the United states and Iran loving us they're loving it\nDo you think that that that the crown princes that's stupid over there if you've seriously this dumb\nThat's why I'm like it would it be rogue agent because for a guy who was able to get into power and kind of neutralize those who opposed him jailed other members of the family I mean he seemed to be pretty smart and doing that this would be a tactical\nTactical idiocy to do something this stupid\nWhatever issues will be like this I was thinking about\nWell I'm not I'm not saying that he's not capable of this but I'm just saying it kind of out of character\nBut there is an option to look at that you wouldn't before and that is\nWho would want to frame them ... like who would want to frame him oh anybody in Iran you know what I'm exactly so they will do love for the state would love for this to spill over into a result the end of the relationship doesn't open up more questions we don't really know yet and neither does well according to what we know from the president we don't really know yet\nRight we can't really draw any conclusions yet there is only possibility\nYeah what I don't get and this is something that does Stephen ... brought up the name when how he said that he recorded something on his I watch and send it to the iCloud before he was that's not how that works like yeah yeah yeah I just don't work that way yeah no it does not work that way I haven't I watch and just out of it with you to do the yeah yeah it does not work that way at all\nUm\nI [noise] sure what we're hearing about the quote unquote audio recordings is that true like we don't even we can't verify that yet because\nYou have to believe turkey you have to believe the country run by ... who is beating up Americans in the street when he came over here to visit so it was like jeez\nThere's only transcripts right is what we have so we really have no audio prove we're no physical proof of any story any conclusion right now right\nI mean there's I I don't think that there is now Trump has asked for audio and video\nHe wants he wanted to be able to um determine and and see that which I think yeah absolutely who should be you know a so he's asked for that [noise] the thing is um\n\nThere was there was a really good piece set that Jay Jay McCullough wrote about the maturity of the the leadership and Saudi Arabia\nAnd he says a mature society would be able to handle a moderate dissident like democracy choking the Saudi kingdom apparently could not uh consequences seem clear\nHe says the reality is Saudi Arabia will remain a U.S ally regardless of how deeply disturbing react involvement in a murder of journalist ... is ultimately reveal to be\nAs Matthew Continetti recently emphasize there are certain geopolitical realities in particular a Cold War with Iran that make the Saudi American alliance a cornerstone of U.S foreign policy no matter how appalling their human rights record\nGet but what it does is it makes it harder to defend\nThat ... you know essentially what he's getting into and I just want to go back to what a Continetti had said [noise] uh as well because he was talking about how what the and you have to consider\nThis I mean it's just you have to consider this a prudent is the right response to all of this is what he had stated which I you know I think so\nUm\nThis um the because of all the players involved because of ... because of Iran because of\nUm uh the\nAll the applications and the consequences that could result that could be a result of this um I mean it was a legal resident of the United states who lived in London in ... assembled ... at Saturday's deny everything except you know maybe it's rogue agents and interrogation gone wrong Turkish authorities say he was murdered\n[noise] uh and\nThere are so many implications of this and I see so many people in media who just want to skip over all of this and not employed ... and just go out\nGuns blazing which is the wrong way to handle this we're going to talk more about it but we've got to get ready to go to break here

you guys heard about the uh I have all this stuff there was a first there was a I'm a Democrat official in Minnesota according to the star Tribune that had to he was suspended because he posted about taking a Jew Peter to get the gear teens\nOkay well he goes yeah eleven seven bring them to the guillotine okay\nAlright probably again not the best language right now\nJust saying you know people who get really mad over an hour glass use to announce a show which is the language bleach doing this yeah the ...\nAnd then Susan Collins her husband revealed that the the rice and threat letter that they got at their house specifically mentioned her support for Kavanaugh oh and then you know she had to GOP candidate to herself in Minnesota\nNow after you had a Democrat Party spokesman suspended every called for violent then\nYou had a Sarah Anderson Minnesota state representative Sarah Anderson Republican was punched in the arm after she saw him and destroying Republican yard signs\nHer attacker only stopped attacking her when she fled to the current dirt in reverse he was charging a her screaming why don't you kill yourself\nA then there's also an investigation that investigation is ongoing and then there is a state rep Republican Shane ... who suffered a concussion because he got punched in the head well speaking with constituents at a restaurant in Benton county\nHe uh was I mean he he has a doctor said he has a four to six week a recovery\nTime ahead of him he was cold Koch while he was sitting at a high taught table at a local eatery and they knocked him right to the floor and it had bounced\nThe hard ground like a basketball\nAnd so I mean yeah I had a concussion and he had to yeah this is this is how Democrats are treating Republicans right now that's why I'm like maybe Tim Kaine shouldn't be saying the stop because it's already happening\nAnd it's for us when you hear someone say oh it happens on both sides of the ... um no the dominant violence is coming from the left\n... just to the science\nYeah [noise] exactly exactly so\nThis um this is just it's awful it's so awful and just keeps getting ... I Hope it doesn't get worse I\nReally hope it doesn't oh and then there is because this is this the stuff that happened in Minnesota where you had their Democrats if there are crazy a there's a lot of local media coverage of it thankfully but these people are just they're\nOut of control out of control so badly they want power when people act like this because to demonstrate how badly they want power I don't want them to have it and I definitely don't want them to have POWER UP their act acting like this is horrible\nAnd it just I see people that are and what the hell is wrong with some people\nWhat ... what is wrong with them what happened how are they going to react if they if they don't if Democrats don't want a house how they're going to react how are they going to react if they win the house oh my gosh I imagine what they'll do\nIt's it's it's just awful\nAnd so I I see all of this and and I I it's I don't think and that's why I think that the all the outrage and the agreement is fake\nBecause if you're outraged your outraged over something that is really truly awful and you want it to be made right but people don't care they want to have ... they want to stay outraged\nThey've been taught that there is power and being outraged you ... your outrage must be catered to which is why tiny Kevin I'll think that was so significant\n\nIt was so incredibly significant because it was the simple no\nThis is what I've always had never been to needed a rage mob you will never satisfy the rage mob the rage mob will move on and find another thing over which to be outraged\nAnd it will continue on and on and on the only reason that the outrage mob exist is because the indulgent of stupid society it's the indulgence of a society that stinks somehow it has to cater to outrage\nDot catering to the mob\nIt isn't serious entity they're not serious they have no ... there are concerns are specious\nThey commit sometimes worst defenses than the individuals who name often falsely accused and things over which they should be outraged about like the ... the women's march leader being anti Semitic or not\nThe things they should be outraged about their silent on their inconsistent outraged true outrage requires some consistency indignation requires some consistency people are clowns we've got to get moving them\nWe have a today and stupidity\nComing up very shortly outdoor limited dot com is a one that is just where I go to get him out the best place to go to get him all they have the best selection of quality products that the best prices by the way for this week\nYou can say big on a C.

[noise]\nThis is what they have it so\nHe's a sexual further North Carolina\n[noise]\nNow my gosh I have a drink and mom on your front lawn warning Seventy seven\nSo our [noise]\nOr radio when\nYou can listen taught our first ... downloading or our calls\nThe latest for for Boston ad that's in Jacki Radley juniors to run home run the red Sox have a seven five lead over the Astros there in the bottom of the sentence in Houston game for the AFC Championship series\nAnd when a player puts his glove in the stands there is no such thing as fan interference natural three sixteen in major league baseball team death like from the Bible for John biting solvent\n... signs in a Steve Austin and at what age mash couple of beers over our head and\nThe boat with the pick six the jets three\nThe Packers sixteen so I'm so excited there's no way you can see that as interference especially on the replays but major league baseball who never wants to overrule an empire if they don't have to says yeah we're sticking with the call in the field and and that ah it's ridiculous I understand\nThat you want to make sure you back up the referees and umpires as much as possible in all sports but baseball is the worst for replay because they don't have anything that is\nThat that's a pattern that you can say okay this is a home run because this is not a home run because this is out because it's really at the whim of whoever is in the booth and and I don't get it there's no consistency like we get I may not like what roughing the pastor is in the NFL but I Know what it is when I see it now\nAnd I may not like what a catch not catch was in the NFL but I Know what that was one I saw it but I Can't tell what's going to be overruled what's not and baseball baseball needs to make sure that Joe West and and and baseball is transparent after this game and someone is available to explain just how it was fan interference when clearly no one reached over\nThe edge to get into the field no one did and still they said yep interferes no ...\nNo it said the rule is explicit very clear ah there's no ambiguity in the first part of the statement right in the way it goes through and they play or puts himself out an ad in his own risk\nAnd its own peril I I don't know what that is supposed to mean in terms of a larger and you know what happens you you're going to end up ... crashing into the bodies in there but we saw bats glove go past the wall\nDefensive position by the\nThe fan as the ball's coming in because let's face it also coming in pretty hot here you're going to have a stinging hand or\nOf your take on to the face you got a problem so your your hands are back and we see that go in and make while they had made contact with one of the fans and get shot I think he was shutting it anyway and wasn't going to catch the ball but they decide\nThat's enough in the stands\nTo call it out to uh to run on road is just allowed and major league baseball if we're going to do review let's let's do it right\nI I don't ever expect consistency 'cause we still have so many in like the NFL you're good judgment calls all over the place you know you're never sure exactly what you're going to get 'cause we we look at interference calls and we look at some of those things that go to reply or we can still\nFight about those but for major league baseball here this one seem fairly obvious what are you gonna do put up Plexiglas like you're in hockey and you're not going to be able to have um a play or go and Rob\nA home run because of the off chance he crashes into a fan 'cause a fan wants a souvenir Mm it's ludicrous\nBecause we want to see it on the fence with a beer banging on the last like they're out of hockey oh that's what I mean hey bet you're sucking mix so early\nBut they didn't object the fan now when they talk to him but he ... the action so in theory just got up and you know you interfered with the ball in play\nHere rejected mhm no questions grab your stuff\nAnd get out just got ejected exactly in this case it saying a server can you not do that again it's\nKind of ludicrous say when you when you look at it and the way major league baseball has decided to abandon or any true reviews of anything on or off the field this point\nI mean really baseball I Need something more from them on on plays like this whether it's Joe western angel Hernandez there's somebody more than that on this I mean really if you're talking about a call that could conceivably\nKnock the Astros out of the post season because Joe West decides Yup I saw it and this is the thing about umpires in major league baseball like Joe West an angel Hernandez\n... what you're supposed to do as an umpire is you're supposed to\nOfficiate by the rules you're not supposed to interpret the rules to how you see it you're supposed to enforce the rules\nAnd when the rule says if a player reaches into the stands there is no fan interference I'm Sorry that's not Joe wants to go yeah but to me he kind of jumped up no no no\nYou have to interpret that as their he reached in the stands that's not fan interference I don't see how you can say that but that to Joel West is natural angel Hernandez is it's not about the rules I have to enforce its Mariah interpretation of the rules\nAnd this is where anybody that's got to follow rules for a living in any any sort of profession always gets in trouble\nAlways get because now it's been my interpretation of what I Need oh well okay then it's your it's your interpretation\nHappens everywhere just slapping happen tonight in major league baseball in this particular\nCase right this isn't a hey let's put some overlay of a strike zone or a yellow first down line or anything else like you reached into the crowd\nIt seems pretty obvious that this is cut and dry Mm right this is an a a judgment call this isn't you know have their fall due to catch in just a little bit of shock\nOr a play at second base where we're talking about all rides bikes and it did the tag beat the runner they're so ... in ... it's an automatic out 'cause that's the way it used to be ... by we got a little bit of controversy and this one also over a play at second base\nWhere Korea doesn't touch the bad right a seal neighborhood white and instead it extends the ending you get a walk in another run so that gives the red Sox and insurance Ron but\nYou know that's interpretation and go through it's clear he touched base but in the past that wasn't reviewed nobody cared like I was close enough\n[noise] Fox Sports radio the Jason Smith show with my band friend my Carmen I'm former warriors star Matt Barnes just came in out of the bullpen guy and got a huge strike out to end the inning Tyler White goes down on strikes\nWhat makes me think that or even better yet what makes you think that he actually knows how to build a team\nTo fair point to this to this point I think we've just seen him do everything he can to denigrate the legacy of Reggie McKenzie is working the national football\n[laughter] he's called out any player he doesn't like I mean he's making the bills looked like a ... well run organizations and they got ...\nOr you make of it you make them a jets look like a lot of\nOil madam de la outlook\nHow about you know they don't even\nDon't even like go whoa whoa whoa wait a second

AOL [noise] download it now [noise]\nYou have to think that this was going to push him out the door because he can opt out of his contract at the end of this season this is why this is a very big deal and why the Dodgers are pushing her shot out the evidence is there\n... I actually talked about it yesterday on the eve of game five 'cause it could wind up being his last started at Dodger you know if the brewers win game six game seven\nHad cursed show last game five it could have been his last start he decides to opt out at the end of this year he could leave and it is a Clinton curse sharp player opt out the Dodgers have no control over this which gets into the big point no directed drawl [laughter] because\nHer show as comfortable talking about hey if this is it this is this is it's been a great run all this but I'm not thinking about this now I'll worry about that after the world series which is what Clinton personal got to say because he's bleeping pitching today but Andrew Freedman who's running the Dodgers front office\nHad the most telling comment today when he was asked about hey what do you feel at this being Clinton Kurdish laws potentially his last game but the Dodgers and he says\nWe're not thinking about that we're focused on this twenty Eighteenth season there's ongoing dialogue we'll discuss this after the season is over that was the statement from Andrew Freedman\nThat tells me they are pushing Clinton ... out and want him to opt out because\nIt's easy to say of course one Clinton back when I was thinking about this being Clinton's last do we want Clayton back whether you want them back or not it's an easy thing to say mhm because you have no control over it right it's up to Clinton Shaw\nWhy can't you say we want him back but they didn't say that he didn't say one thing it's an easy thing to say yes we want him back but he didn't say it occurred showing knows they didn't say it when they could have it's an easy thing to say hey yeah we want to back but they didn't\nWe told you a week and a half ago this is the Dodgers pushing Clinton crochet out and so many people on social media Twitter on the show like oh you're crazy the Dodgers want to keep a guy like this and that means a lot to have them play his whole career with the Dodgers I go yeah that would be a lot to the fans wouldn't it doesn't mean a lot to the Dodger front office\nThey're not invested in Clinton her show they didn't bring plate in ... in they didn't draft him these these are baseball number cruncher analytics who said this is how we're going to manage the game's going the players are necessary evil they don't care if Clinton Kurdish all plays the whole the whole career in Los Angeles\nThey're okay with him leaving he could leave\nYes you're on the show some times where we had a story line 'cause now people are coming around to the hey you know if this is Clinton ... final day this is a very uh\nThis is a very big moment this time and you know Clinton ... could leaving I'm seeing all the columns written now and I'm like where are you guys a week and a half ago we were just out of this sometimes just realize sometimes were ahead of the head of the curve for head of it were at a stories sometimes weeks sometimes months what is your next week\nNext month next year's takes tonight it's it may\nNever know why did he got an I ... up what's the longest time it's been between us having a U.S I'm Glad you didn't what how long has that been [noise]\nIt's a good question what to get our crack research staff on that [laughter] but as relates year and then as you imagine if you're looking at the\nThe overall major league baseball landscape guys don't stay in one place they don't have that celebration like we did once upon a time oh Twenty years of service in the same city it doesn't have that same meaning it doesn't have that same push especially when you start looking at\nThe ability to change up your roster and play the saber metrics game and look at\nHow you build a twenty five man roster versus the way things used to be used to have a lot more of the history legacy and you needed to sell in the the Dodgers part five years ago yeah it was Clinton Herschel ... it was an awful lot of Clayton gr Sean germs have your marketing and promotion it's not any more\nIt hasn't been for years you've got a lot of other faces that requires some marketing time and an extra out of your sales group\nBecause you see what what they're able to bring in and fuel to different parts of your fan base and it doesn't take anything away from Clinton Herschel he's still a beast\nWhen you're looking at a two seven three alright nine wins but you've had some injuries you got a huge price tag and you've got new guys you got really you've got you you've got other opportunities to look within your organization and marine guys up and well money's never an issue\nYou're still thinking about well what's your rate of return\nOr acquaintance ... it's not just straight I hey we can spend the money and be done with it those days are gone it's a different world so as we look at it going forward it's it's a different Dodgers team and Clinton curse jog two out of three games has been masterful\nFor them we'll see if

West is someone who has a history of being a guy who thinks people come to the major league ballpark to watch me on pie they don't and I know but he thinks they\nDo don't you get excited when he's on the car though he's into something could happen if he does yeah he does and it's like that when you see special guest they go to a comedy club yo know its current\nThat's going to be ... well hey maybe a little Chris Rock I don't know print bought learn from grace underfoot so I don't think she gets special guests yeah well she's I'm Walking Dead now apparently I mean it's not only and Walking Dead 'cause I'm cool but apparently she's on it now I don't know if\nYou just say they'll give you more than a data on it as the one you said give I\n... uh the season premiere of the second season with me and\nOkay so I've been gone for a while now\nAnd I'm not you know and the history ... downloaded on ice you know I'm so glad I never have to watch another problem for that ... oh my God\nI'm but I think she gets special guests yeah well she's I'm Walking Dead now apparently I mean it's not my wife and Walking Dead 'cause I'm cool but apparently she was on it now I don't know if you just\nSaid it doesn't give you more than a date on it as to what you said give I\nUh uh the season premiere of the second season with me and\nOkay so I've been gone for a while now\nAnd I'm not Joe and the history ... down from it and I I'm so glad I never have to watch another problem that I Would say oh my God I'm\nButt naked I I Would get that you call it a home run and then you go back and look at it on replay to make sure there is no fan interference but how does he see that he doesn't see we're ... glove is he can't see it from where he's at so to call fan interference on the field is ridiculous absolutely ridiculous\nBut he does call for review I'm like okay well this is where it's going to get changed\nAnd despite the fact that the fans in the first row\nDo not reach over the field of play for the ball in fact they're doing every nobody that can tell me that ... was in the field of play the fact that his glove touches the fans who are not reaching over\nThere there's a there's a there's a full foot foot and a half between where the fences and the line is and where the fans hands are well that's\nThe biggest thing based on the way the rule is explicitly written it's not fan interference in the player goes into\nInto the crowd is it is at their own peril like the way they\nRaise it and that kind of grandiose terminology but the fact of the matter is you got the glove closing\nAnd we can argue based on the different camera angles how much of that was that's closing it himself versus contact with a fan and was he ever going to catch the ball anyway 'cause the ball seemed to be coming a inches\nGood nine to twelve inches away from where his glove is at that moment like I don't agree with with ... I agree with everybody else or ... as the world's about is I don't know how you assume it out\nWell you know and that's one thing that I don't know can you look at the replay because I just I don't believe that the fan made that closes love he was closing his level rent looks to me like you're already close that ball\nHe was not going to catch it right he's not going to catch that ball because he's jumping up and he's putting his glove up there he is not in a position to catch the ball he is going into the stands to try to make an incredible catch now I don't know if that's part of the review process I mean I'll I'll tell you when I Know self and don't know stuff\nIs that part of where they can look at it and say for fan interference can they interpret it and say well he wasn't going to catch the ball\nAnd so that so that's out the window\nWhen it's got to be an unwritten rule and that's the case because as this lays out\nIt's the rules as if it's out of the field to play there is no fan interference they've got to be reaching into the field of play taken further the fed wasn't ejected ... for interfering with a a bad at all in play right isn't that the normal protocol\nIf if you had a shot it out on the line or something and I had to reach over\nYou're out you're getting a nice security escort to the to your seats uh and then grab your stuff and I'm going to take you out in a in a way you go into the parking lot for a good night here fan was evidently talk to you for a minute or two but didn't get himself injected so the\nThat and that's in Congress you might as well just put up the the Plexiglas element like hockey then\nEverything now that I ... monster shore so you don't have any jumping over the fence unless they become super humans with pogo steaks and met a human Janelle running out in the outfield so we might lose a little bit of the excitement of Mike Trout and look he bets and these guys but we'll have fans banging on the glass in person to people so that's good\nWell they're only applied wrong what might be or where it's like well don't you have people saying hey I Know you've got to let them have a place for their beer yeah Fox\nSports radio that Jason Smith show with my bank\nFriend my comment when you're hiring you don't want to waste time sorting through dozens of irrelevant resumes you want an efficient way to get to a short list a qualified candidate that's why you need indeed dot com host the job and minutes set up screen or questions based on your job requirements then\nZero in on qualified candidates using the two of online dashboard discover why three million businesses using deed for hiring posted job today at indeed dot com slash fire that's indeed dot com slash higher search for greatness search indeed\nAnd you know I I don't know what I'm expecting for major league baseball I say I want to hear it but I Know we're just going to be disappointed 'cause that's you know that's major league based live near the ... there was a kid you haven't always disappointed oh well maybe they'll ... now they're just going to do this but I I I I really I don't know how they can say yes upon further review we have to stick with Joe West call", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jason Smith Show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "18"}
