I you know national reciprocity and also\nAbout the Iraq we just became best friends that I Will vote for you always that's how that works\nWe just yeah meanwhile canes Quito I don't know if you guys know that he reminds us five thousand times a day they Quito I have a pumpkin filled with Halloween candy that a sitting\nLike not four feet from him intentionally tempting I well it's very ... comes in here\nAnd he dug through yesterday and he was all getting 'cause he found himself a little ... enjoy which by the way ... is ally yeah those are fun and he can he he takes the ... and I was telling

the best choice and that pumpkin the best choice in a pumpkin is ... ... is a protein [noise]\nYou know those are Quito right hand does is sit you know we don't have a ... like an hour and a half [noise]\nThat's all [noise] when they fail\nAre free\nAs you get these people who might be good with fundraising and good with money and they're like they got a great idea they think their ideas people too and so they they've come up and they get a great idea for Annette and then because they're surrounded by people they run with it and it turned out to be like what you're about to hear\nSo this path decided\nHow this can we help this candidate I Know we're on this ad that's pretty much racism defined I think\nThat there are well I'm going to play the ad for you first and I just know that Democrats have done stuff like this in my home state of Missouri\nThere were robo calls like this there were mailers that went out that were similar to this before let Republicans are going to kill all the blind people\nI hate it when they do it and I'm just shocked at this pact chose to do this it's a ... a sixty seconds spot and just listen to what just listen to what is that\nWhat do you think about what's happening in Washington\nCongress may French and the Republicans know that it's dangerous to change the presumption of innocence to a presumption of guilt especially for black me if the Democrats can do that to a white justice of the Supreme Court with no ... no operation and witnesses including her best friend that you've been happy\nFather's when a white girl lives on the girl\nWon't be let you in black folk again always told ... don't mess around with that if you get caught she will crime rate\nI voted to keep Congress my French and the Republican because we have to protect me and envoys we\nAfford to the white Democrats take us back to the bad old days of race verdict life said just let you want a white\nGirl strings rate paid for by black Americans for the president's agenda not authorized by any standard for candidates committee\nNow the pet can do whatever they want to do as black Americans for Trump agenda there you know people can fundraise and they can [noise] doesn't mean that everybody has the best ideas and\nI don't know I don't know this packet or known anybody involved with it I just know previously when I Know that there have been races before where packs have decided to do something that they thought were helped the was helping a candidate and it's like\nNo that does not help the candidate [noise] here's the thing though I'm everything that they're saying in the ad aside from the lynching\nBecause I don't think Democrats went to lunch black people just like I don't think that the Democrats who previously said Republicans wanna Lynch white people I don't think Republicans are by people I don't think Republicans when all is why people [noise] I just think we could probably make a point with all engines\nAside from that\nEverything that they're staying in it is literally things that I have conversations I have had an every woman I Know has had all of my female friends particularly the moms are boys we have all had these conversations with each other all of the tap\nAnd\nWhen they say that you know a girl could uh you know why or and I've shared with your story after story after story of this or where you have the presumption of guilt as opposed to innocence these are huge teams that are cornerstones of our republic it's due process\nAnd they're very serious issues and there is a cultural war against that\nAnd so the ad bring that up and I I mean those are those are things that a lot of people have have discussed\nThe problem comes in when it's well everybody's going to get one inch I'm just that completely undermined and just robbed all of the other point\nOf any attention when that happened there just was not going to do I I mean I heard this the first time and I went oh my gosh what\nWhat I just\nAnd I don't and I know from what I understand because it's black Americans for the Trump agenda\nI don't know how that plays in the black community even if it's done by a a black organization\nI don't know how that I mean I just think regardless of the ... the more important point that were being made at the beginning the fact that due process is under attack\nDue process is being undermined our Fourth Amendment rights are being undermined and there is absolutely and I have talked about this I've mentioned it in my books a cultural war on boys\nAnd it just missed all of that because they went from talking about this to\nWhom Jane I just it's it's\nA problem that the left has when they talk about skin color to like it's not\nWe all know that that's not it right the someone's character that makes them who they are has nothing to do with their skin color so I think you're right they diluted the really important message which actually there's a lot of important information and messaging in the commercial if it goes important but when they talk about the white Dems lynching or white girl calling rape or whatever\nIt loses it loses me you know what I mean it's a bad message is lost on me completely and\nI was identifying with them or ... at first like oh these are boy a mom and I'm listening to boy I'm like I Know and then right when they went to the ... I'm like\nYou're the care about their husbands their sons their their grandfathered care about those pretty a gift that but then when you went right into that left the tactic of saying it's um you know what I mean that's what it it's a lefty tactic that turns people off and we saw it in twenty six\nUsed to take it down because Twitter while they cannot stand gay conservative\nTotally okay if you're an anti Semite and you compare Jewish people to termites the clip is still on to what are the spokesman for the company told buzzfeed added new policy Andy humanizing content common hasn't gone into effect that says that just to see the video down the Facebook took it down\nAnd I I Can't even believe it has to be like the same thing which is our had seen Brett Kavanaugh as today\nDid you guys know this apparently that is a thing a which is in Brooklyn are inviting practitioners to place a hacks on Brett Kavanaugh and the patriarch [noise] cats land and it's sad [noise]\nAn establishment that does not have cats they're not actual attack them [noise]\nBrooklyn premier a cult bookshop and spiritual community's faith and the sounds like an episode importantly India issued an invitation on faith but ... says please join us for Republican tax on Kavanaugh and rapist and the patriarchy which apparently are all the same thing a blah blah blah witchcraft\nIsn't like the whole rule like what you put out you'll get back to ... isn't that kind of how it works yeah there's some sort of metric there but it's not good for the people sending out that yeah that's like bad on yeah right\n... ... isn't up anymore I didn't even know what the thing with it nobody cared real safer now I Know but it's\nLike a fascinating care judicial watch filed a complaint against Christine Blasey Ford lawyers for violating the rules of professional responsibility [noise]\nJudicial watch they're taking legal action they filed a complaint with the board of professional responsibility\nOr at a D.C court on attorneys Deborah cats Lisa Banks and Michael Brown which they said they violated the rules of professional responsibility and a representation of Dr Ford by not informing a doctor for that Senator Grassley offered to quote fly female staff investigators to meet Dr Ford in California or anywhere else to obtain her testimony in quotes\nAnd might not sharing it with her they say her attorneys violated those rules\nComing up Louie Gohmert joined us to discuss the migrant caravan working its way up to the U.S border stay with us [noise]\nHave you ever taken your car in for an

deductible may apply ...\n[noise]\nI did last on Twitter official didn't lash on Facebook so the president has said that look\nThis caravan of migrants that's flooding through a bunch of different countries I guess preparing for some sort of stand off of the U.S border where people a plan to apply for asylum on the president said look\nIt tweeted and said we strongly and formed a president upon doors that if that large carbon if people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or a will be given to Honduras effective immediately\nWell now we hear that Mexico is moving to stop the migrants caravan\nAnd the outgoing Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto um they have a new trade deal with the United states and so obviously I think he's looking to score some points and it looks like they're trying to do whatever they can to stop and joining us right now on this issue\nIs our good representative from the beautiful Republican Texas congressman Louie Gohmert who are of course obviously has been watching us as though they're going to be coming up to do all the southern Texas border congressmen good to have you as always\nAlways good to talk to your day and a bit [noise] well it's better this thing isn't it yeah yeah and thank God that Trump is the president literally a you know I get tired of\nPeople calling us named traitors and all these things because we want to do what will be best\nNot only for America even if you don't care about the Seventy thousand Americans that died from a drugs mostly from Mexico or if you cared about the Mexican people and the people in Central America you would say yeah let's stop\nA secure the border which don't encourage these kind of caravans there have been projections maybe one in four or more are girls that come up your raped along the way\nThere are people that die every time that there's this big assault and I think our department of justice and are in jail or be looking at whether or not there were any Americans that were helping plunging helping with funding on this assault on\nOur sovereignty but as we can do from Mexico is secure the border build a wall where we need it and so it\nCuts off to eighty billion project you're gone from us in the Mexico drug cartels for drugs they're projections that may be that much more was made all human trafficking insect strategy by the drug cartels but you got those\nTens of billions or maybe hundreds of billions of dollars off\nThat's going to drug cartels and the corruption slow store crawl and Mexico but gums one of the June economies in the world and brings El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras\nAlong with it but a Trump is taking a strong stance and I'm so grateful years it despite what\nThe haters the ... the laughter mainstream whatever you want to call me do whatever they say it's still the most compassionate thing we can do is not continue to encourage quote Obama did people get hurt doing that ...\nYeah no that's that's for sure the uh one of the ... the guy I guess who is one of the other or one of the organizers of this had been detained by Guatemalan police officers they said he wouldn't comply with Guatemalan immigration rules so\nThey arrested him and deported him back to Honduras are we seeing more cooperation as a result of Trump saying look will will will end a weren't will close the\nWill close the border are are are they now it seems like they're they've been incentivized to to maybe perhaps cooperate a little bit more\nWell yeah you're exactly right says what's happening\nAnd they also know there's just not Obama this is a man that will do what he says and so uh they know we serious serious when he says\nThe workout ... tariffs on or where and when he says look we'll put the military on the border if necessary and and I talked with the then candidate Donald Trump two years ago about this\nUh and and the fact that actually\nWoodrow Wilson one of my least favorite presidents he actually did one thing right after ... punch over his day came across into the United states and killed a bunch of families\nAh Asia journal pushing down a jet that put military and

saying and it's not just women and children by the way there are a lot a lot a lot to do there\nI see more men than women children to be honest with you are a lot more and yeah there's a lot of I mean they are just warming and busting through the gates I'm I'm shocked that no one's actually getting trampled\nAnd I don't know I mean I don't know what Mexicans going to do but the president was very clear in his words that it's going to affect a lot of stuff if uh there's going to be a consequence\n\nIf they don't do something to him I mean you can have as many people going through you just get out of his name I mean this is crazy it is not that that's a mob of people and they're carrying their countries' flags with them\nWhich is kind of weird\nYeah they're like they're marching are carrying their countries' flags with them\n... that I mean they're just it's just\nFor more loyal to to their country because wouldn't you stay I mean wouldn't you ... if you had loyalty to your own country yeah it is kind of weird right\nI don't yeah that is a little weird but\nThat's just just wow that is a pretty unbelievable so that's what's happening right now I'm at the border uh people are crashing the border\nSo my goodness that's quite a lot quite a lot of people\nHow many did they say is and how many they think stays in the Caribbean or ... originally because it was four thousand I think is what they were saying oh yeah I think there's ... there might be more than ... yeah I think there's I'm just looking at all the different videos and uh yeah I think there is because they wanted to snowball it's a gathering people as it goes\nWell because one video zone is almost five minutes long and people are still going through they tore down the fence at two separate points and there are people that are up on some of the statues directing them and where to go and they for like five minutes people just flip\nThrough like a stream that is a lot of people and and it was still going like it was an end to video just stopped\nThat's a lot of people\nThat's not just a small little contingency before thousand was just an estimate and visually it looks more than that\nSo what happens if they go to the border and they try to do this stuff are border oh I Know that there is no let's be real there are some people on the left I Would love that object I Would love to see you know the the the violent progressive is um they would like to just so they could see look at them look at our border agents attacking these people\nWell I mean they're good grief is is just it's just crazy but there and they'll take them some time to get to get through Mexico but my goodness what is going to happen then\nSo they're they're still I think are entering Mexico right now and uh we'll see what happens but am I going to sit in stupidity ...\nI mean the entire media\nHas been trying to point to Trump saying\nHe was not a fan of fake news but trying to flee to what you said the enemy of the people in the media which came across was doing the same thing at the rally last night here is\nRose was on the other authors cause whether or not\nLiterate or you know points genes are violent rooms mortars and it was around ...\nLoving every minute of those were the brother was only children around a little or something\nSo they're trying to conflict and it's so funny to that we see all the violence coming from me in the foot and in these left organizations Acosta crickets on the butt because Trump's do something really hits big media because has got to take it personally and everything that comes out of his ... his could flip the switch yeah it's\nYeah it's really ridiculous that that and that is our today in stupidity folks have a great night at the last ... on Twitter official didn't lash on\nFacebook is where you can find me checking out an Instagram other good jazz have a great weekend back with you Monday\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] that's all\nAre fairy\nThat was a horrendously rent if game and listen a lot of problems in Arizona obviously the Wilkes I mean what what is Josh rows and do it in that game right he's not learning anything it's just learning how to get his butt kicked\nTrailers how tall you might as well get a stuntman\nRight and now he's got an injured toe so how long is that going to linger for can even play next week you know she's got to run for his life as it is and MIke McCoy Iowa yeah yeah yeah I I mean that's what happened to him\nYou know what happened to him he didn't he didn't change you know it's funny because tendency started to show up in the analytics and there's an interesting too if you follow the Twitter thread a sharp ... football yeah the guy called up before the game he said look this guy all he does is called run plays right up the center\nYou're calling wrong place at the middle of your office of line with two backup guards who have no business being there against the Broncos defense that is bound and determined to make you pass the football they're going to stop the run because they're not going to become\nThe first team in NFL history to give up three straight to a hundred yard Rogers are the only team ever to give up a two games to two hundred yard Russia's back to back so what just what a mess right now in Arizona and you really have to wonder Steve Wilkes can't get this thing going get some positive momentum going with burn off which now has a new seat does even returning twenty Nineteen\nAnd do they trade or Larry Fitzgerald David Johnson and anything else I Know they just resigned Johnson and all but\nYou know the the Patrick Peterson thing is probably the most interesting guy of all just because you know they're playing his own defense and he's he's really a man corner I mean look he's outstanding right if we could play whatever but you know the bang for your buck is you know getting guys that are his own corners and they're not supposed to be big money guys\nYou know you're supposed to be able to find those guys and the draft and you know for Patrick Peterson I mean look you again and you talk last night great interception but it can be spent better elsewhere on this team that looked at this is just a real mess right now\nAnd you gotta wonder too about the general manager Steve Wilkes with his future is going to be in the desert if they don't again data stark any something's going by the end of the season\nI wouldn't be visited and if we didn't get into the latest involving oh back in June you're following a giant John Mars elements this week he was like oh Dell to talk less in play more\nOh del said today in a wide ranging interview with the New York media he respects a John ... opinion any wants to move on to what's next in is not thinking about the past and no longer to throw you lie manning under the bus obviously that is until next time\nThere are things right now as far as old Alan ... and his relationship and where the giants are with having him continue on with the team\nWell I mean he doesn't have to do it because his dad got Instagram game right and he took a shot at John merit tonight you know on Instagram so we've got that also we found out today or do back um junior does not\nLike water about that yeah yeah he decided that I don't like water so you're fairly has a hydration\nIssue it caused him to leave the field last time prematurely when the giants were going to be running a play at the end of the happy was already headed into the locker room to have that address came out a little bit late once his teammates were on the field so we're finding out all sorts of stuff about auto Beck and junior\n... you know the weird part about this is this that the giants did this to themselves this is self inflicted wound did you think that the money\nThat you gave out of that country and it was going to change him from being who he is\nI mean he's a quirky guy you know and now you've caused a ration because there's folks who say listen I was just telling you like it is\nYou lie stinks you know he'd rather be somewhere else has franchise isn't going anywhere I mean and and you know the giants they're like well we paid you to to be a team player and to you know stop what you've been doing and just play football so it's again this is just another side show for a giant team that had tried to move beyond that\nAs we know after you know the ... but they're really struggling with that and they're ... they're stuck with oh back um junior which isn't a bad problem have right when he's playing well but they they're committed to him for the next two years pressing giants fans can hope for lose out to get that number one overall pick and get that young man from Oregon on your team\nRight prognostications time one of the more interesting games like I could talk about bears patriots all day bill bell jak so if you use it with his praised about the bears that it makes everybody nervous but he said he was you just do it on and on about great play calling whatever else which usually means he's about to unleash held\nA snake and raising a we've got the big off ants obviously for June ... and company ravens given up your than Thirteen points for game what kids in this one\nWhere you know and this is this the interesting part of the you know Drew Brees is never beat in the Baltimore Ravens\nEver wondered why what\nThree teams left last summer\nThat's about it and now he will join the five hundred club the Sunday you know an evidently one touchdown pass to join Peyton Manning Brett Farr and Tom Brady in that five hundred club in an underrated part of the saints team you know they have the NFL's number one run defense Seventy one point for yards again that's all of the saints\nAre giving up and the ravens have had some pretty darn good balance on the offensive side of the football they're very good by the way scoring on the opening drive I mean this is a really good at you know type element of for their team they also on defense having them out any points on the opening series for the second half\nThe ravens and the cowboys the only teams that have come out of half time making whatever adjustments or cliche I can throw out there but they have to give it up the scores like look I don't think the ravens are going to sack Drew Brees eleven times like the markets Mario to last week but but I think this is the ravens game it is in Baltimore is on a floor track obviously that you know playing than rather\nIn the Louisiana Superdome I think this is the ravens game now look I I'm not saying that the ravens are going to the super bowl or anything like that I'm Still very published about the saints but I just don't like this match for New Orleans I think the ravens when and I think you know when to leave by the way to Las Vegas taking a bath\nPoor them with all the odors that have been going on the fear for the gambling so I think this is actually going to be one of the few games is an under this week uh with the ravens winning a close one probably scoring you know let's say twenty Seventeen something quite one\nYou hear about serious accident NFL radio insider

the ropes and the first and second innings they threatened they get the one run on David freezes home run\nBut young junior you pitch game six tonight was abysmal he gets batted around in the first inning gives up for runs\nAnd from there on the Dodgers were playing catch up they were never able to overcome he comes back out in the second inning gives up or run finally after three innings Dave Roberts goes to the bullpen and brings in ... and were used night is over I Would bet\nA lot of money that we'll find out some time in the next few hours that review was tipping his pitches tonight and the brewers knew what was coming I mean not in not in a stolen signs kind of way\nBecause we had the story earlier today the brewers think the Dodgers were stealing signs everybody's dealing signs where everybody used on my side used all by just about\nNot that but in a way where he is tipping is pictures like last year in game\nSeven in game two of the world series we found out you ... pitches the Astros knew what was coming\nBecause of the way he would move to rip the ball before his pitch sure all the talk of Severino going is that right oh September and into the playoffs as well it always baffles me the teams can't figure this out like why are the why is that team the last one to know like out of out of a not fit\nOh boy why is this guy getting hit so hard you know they watch a video and they look back how is nobody figured out oh you ought to step in his pitches right here\nIt's always a curiosity right why isn't the pitching coach noticing something maybe the bullpen catcher watching what whatever the case may be that there's there's not somebody\nIn the dug out in the organization that that doesn't pick up on that\nBefore the damage has been done right were here first ball swinging multiple times and just battered around as we talked about over the course of the night they weren't she pitch again one blue otherwise it was a lot of hanging balls in the zone that they just eat off on\nAny time a pitcher who does it normally get hit gets hit like this early on\nThat's where I think pitch tipping right the first any for you went like this can get Saddam infield single I mean not not sharply it but he gets on a single yellow grounds out the third Turner makes a pretty good player that would've been a base it on walks after Shaw strikes out argue are hits the double now that wasn't\nA well struck ball but it was a well placed ball then three consecutive pitches after that first pitch to my stock is double the right field it's three to one next pitch crutch singles to right field Mustafa scores next pitch arts singles to left field\nBang bang bang all hard hit balls all off of review this is the guy who gave up three runs in the first inning all season long he gives up for the night he was taping his pitches somehow somehow the brewers figured it out and they went to town on him and the first couple of innings Spygate\nAnd she's going to get the best by major league baseball anyway it doesn't have to be illegal I mean when you find out a picture is tipping pitches\nThat doesn't need the auto I'm saying that they they they got the guy from Houston since he's been eliminated oh on waivers the I put a sat in a brewers code on him now I think you're I think it's actually the later\nOh front who is now reinvented himself with a new identity about at the guy from Houston has gone into witness protection and now he says he's like Henry Hill now he's the witness relocation and there is no he's reinvented himself as a a guy to take video with cameras\nWalk it out and his bathrobe to get his newspaper in the morning I doubt it right but that's really where I'm at with with that because it does the rest of it doesn't make sense 'cause ... too good to see them yes he was away from Dodger Stadium tonight which is not where he pitches we'll we'll do it three five eight yeah regular season away from home you know not exactly a\nA a butcher when it's all said and done\nThis was something where I I I Would almost be positive that's what we're going to hear\nAnd now if you're the Dodgers worried about Walker builder and gave several you to bring anything out do they know they're going to go to town off you 'cause this is first inning first pitch in and they know what's coming they know what he's going to throw they were really really comfortable especially in a game in which they were on their heels going to the bottom of the first inning\nYou don't know park is crazy going nuts freeze leads off the whole running that everybody sitting on their hands and that's\nOkay what's gonna happen to us and now they come back in the bottom of the first thing that's bang bang bang bang bang and suddenly it's four to one and the game is basically over at that point well\n... in his twenty batters face only at a first pitch strike eight times so hitting advantages well and just didn't make him pay\nTail of the tape though right we we look at the Dodgers last couple of games get them on get them like doing their best to play small ball especially\nUh in game five where you're standing innings and trying to get the just put the ball and claiming ... with a base hit the opposite way\nOr in the in the what was that the second inning right so we we look at that age he was the only one doing any situational eating everybody else was swinging from the heels again and we got the same results all out enough\nLet's say you're listening to Dave Robert sewers meaning the media now talking about the Dodgers failure and game six looking at the game seven tomorrow night against the brewers just other than review or any of the pictures that we thought stage ... tomorrow\n[noise] um [noise] outside of of a review a movie I saw while\nWe're we're a good spot [noise] questions I don't [noise] our guy\nThere is that said even taking in game seven into account ... how much do you have kind of having to do that though that you know this is still obviously\nA ... game six are you guys weren't totally out of it right within striking distance and how how difficult is the\nNo ... it's tough um [noise] but when you're when you're down three [noise]\nTo to run [noise]\nFor me would have been [noise]\nMost of my horse them to break it off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] do you like to have to close [noise]\nThey got away because of the [noise]\nAnd differential they use them so\nIt's just important for us again for\nWater to go up there and throw the ball well for guys to give us a wheat and um the pressure on\nThe Russians pretty Jesse ... looking at the scene tomorrow I mean you saw a little bit more because he was in the west last year uh what is it is the pitching better than you've ever seen them and why in your opinion [noise] um [noise] he's using his\nUm curb Baltimore\nKeeps the ball down well I'm obviously has a slight are really tough on writers [noise] um and he's got to see where that doesn't run so um we've seen him a lot um we know how he's going to attack us and now it's about chickens are taking advantage of a potential stakes\nHis baritone day Thursday and and I am so excited

that\nMaybe he could lead Ryan Braun pitch it never could be more drawn you know but rather [noise]\nVery nice thank God you know I I take a little bit of that you over something we've been talking about on and off the last night what is that what we're looking at all the big NFL games with\nThe weekend yeah and certainly patriots bears is a big kind of a big deal it's a big game\nThere's eagles is is kind of a big yeah you know I'll I'll look I'll give you that you take I'm rich with me cowboys Redskins isn't okay game it's cowboys Redskins so it sounds grow when the cowboys are thinking actually when they boasting that well those divisions still there I mean it has ... woods is a\nDiverse still got a lot of problem division stinks [laughter] just a game of the week I mean really you're really a big proponent you're trying to if you're trying to go The Revenge it's what\nThey were really anger revenge gave for the jets yeah we're still in the bigger story in the off season we're Kirk Cousins was going to go it was down to the Vikings and the jets and obviously the video he put out showed everybody I've just using the jets to go to the there was a good move okay great a troll job Kirk Cousins has a lot of attention on him\nThe jets have attention on them now after winning a couple yeah they do and say I'm drawing a blank well and now it's the Kirk Cousins revenge game this was the biggest game of the week\nI think that's a good game of the week I mean you could patriots bears that that I don't think you do not get it right All right great\nYeah somebody get to the refrigerator Perry run in for a touchdown we get to see a couple of months you intercept show and a Joe name it's got to show up at a fur coat Korea I mean what are you offering me Kirk\nCousins revenge game that's the biggest scale what are you saying they're going to beat him down yes\nThey're gonna hit him and it ... and then again and again and again they do you like that every time they not only if they were my up and they were able to cars are going to do that that'll be great anytime the jets were psyched up and motivated they play well they're coming\nBack to back when it doesn't matter ... area well amber they're ready Super Bowls yeah no they're ready for this game it's the biggest game that we are at the jets have fourteen sex on the season tied for Eighteen with facts ...\nReally not living up to the next ... nickname and all that would be this exchange again for the jets\nAre like that they do have bought ten interceptions ... while they heard all along the leaders in the ... and and we know Kirk Cousins we'll give you a couple yeah see well over the course of the game that will happen or dealt with cook back for this one so expecting a little bit now it's it's certainly game were paying on edge to my downplaying it just\nWe had some great soundbite from Bill Belichick the baseball and the opening of the NFL or as NBS you'd say he's got to push that off to the side because he's been just spouting off phrase ... nine thousand words soliloquy is about\nThe play calling it Matt baggy and ... and everything that usually means that he's bringing the pain [laughter] next time I\nMean while not to say we told you so much ratings for Thursday Night Football came in Broncos yeah the cardinals\nWere told you you put these teams are nobody's gonna watch you gotta put star teams on six point six was the rating for the goes card and it was still better than everything else no better than any other sport\nThat was on not as good as how I met your mother or whatever you know one of the night last night but you're talking about\nOther games with ten million plus viewers and now you're down to his six six you're saying so beat everybody else to everybody\nYeah but you know that's not a game that people are going to want to get people buy more that's the point my idea you put the star teams on and then late in the season you flexible schedule even Thursday night games it's not that hard to do it could work\nI like your aggressiveness in your tenure as football commissioners slashed czar not changing their name you're going you want to leave commissioner with ... you want to start a new era\n[noise] three hundred I bought a fresco Mike it's slowing down coming up next we'll hear from Craig council and you're not going to believe who

[noise]\nYes all the [noise] you know he was um\nYou know probably the closest was the eighth inning\nUm we we uh we were up um you know we we talked down around there to make it six to ... percent carbon out there um you know he was going to have turned Ballenger and um\nYou know if anybody got on it was probably going to be Josh or I mean I'm Sorry he was going to have Turner Machado is anybody got on I think Josh Josh with him at a Ballenger so [noise]\nYou know the carbon that I'd go six up in six down and that really that's what keeps Josh out of the game in addition that we tacked on some runs and and then we gave him some stays in the ninth and just keep going so\nBest case scenario for sure for us in Morrow here twelve [laughter]\nI mean it's you know he is um you know his his ... he got up tonight I'm you know we'll see we'll see how he goes but the ... you'll see him tomorrow\nYou know you may seem start shopping nope not going to starting to start Hader and you will see him early in that game they're not gonna wait to bring him in to say okay the eighth inning they will need they will say we want to maximize him because if you wait till the eighth inning for a A R I we're gonna wait then you just have it in and he's not pitching\nSo I I Would not be surprised to see him early maybe not the first reliever that comes in depending on why should scene comes out of the game but you'll see 'em by the fifth inning in this game and he'll go five six seven and then try to close things and then the brewers will try to close things up\nDrawn out as long as you can I mean that's the guy that the Dodgers had hoped to we heard from David Roberts earlier in the show or that they'd hoped it had been able to force the issue to get him out of the pan and into the game couldn't do it seven to your final uh not really much of a threat or\nEarly on thought you could break the damn against Miley didn't uh your herd counsel with the effusive praise of what Miley was able to do and what he meant that team\nOh what is your gut tells you for tomorrow night's game what did you got to tell you happen to run it got\nTells me that that Mueller gets in trouble early and all bets are off\nThe oil the brewers are in the world series the brewers are in the world would take away shuttle\nHitting which as we know has been a yeah kill a CEO would be the way to say it for the Dodgers that hate or is your X factor that leads them to victory\nI'm going to say this there will be a lot of runs tomorrow night I don't think you're going to see a low scoring game a game where ... where runs or squeezed out these are two teams with exhausted bullpen and I think you're going to see a ton of runs tomorrow night how about this\nThe home run by freezing the first was the Dodgers first in thirty two innings\nOh and that are just let it only hit home lives and they got to hit the long ball but I'll say this the Dodgers come out on top you know in a wild game in a in a nine eight\nTen nine type game tomorrow night Clinton's ... comes in and her show out the fire cursed shock comes in in the AIDS Jansen comes in and the nights about that but you know we're going to
