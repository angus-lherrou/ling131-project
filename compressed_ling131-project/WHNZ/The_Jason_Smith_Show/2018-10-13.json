I'm ... from every parking think about on Monday to double mountain everything you buy\nYou can listen taught our first I ... [noise] download it out [noise]\nAnd put Woodrow Finn when Woodrow was leading off the bottom of the third inning you would think OK ... audio pits the third inning and that'll be it you know throw about fifty pitches and that'll be it for you consult but he brings in order now on credit counseling for the game I say well I brought one of the things I wanted to hit off of Clinton\nCurse the greatest move I ever did I go full troll he brings WWE pull out a championship belt do the whole nine yards\nHe brings wander events in order for of course it's a home run off of her job but [noise] you go to your vote and after\nThe second inning and now we're ... two innings and now Josh hater has gone three\nTimes as long as doubting since July third forty six pitches for Josh ... or so that's got to be a form and the brewers are going to have somebody else for the eighth and ninth here's the big thing is you have a very\nDaunting scheduled the rest of this series you play I Believe it's seven games and nine days right that's what it is potentially mhm and how often can you go to your bullpen for seven innings and night you know you play today Josh hater is going to be unavailable tomorrow I\nKill others don't you kiss the motion lazy thrown at any outing all year\nSo he'll be unavailable tomorrow eventually you like to think well I'll win the game and worry about tomorrow tomorrow and there's nothing you can do about it because it's not like ... all these other\nOptions saying I'll just go do this but that's the one thing that might that would stop is if you think after ... won\nThe series really pills to Milwaukee because they've beaten Clayton commercial already and and and they're off to the races is that this is going to be hard as the series gets deeper Milwaukee's bullpen will get more and more vulnerable because when you have guys when you have guys pitching seven innings and night\nThat's going to be a lot you got to hope that I hear oh comes in and pitches five innings at some point and that may or may not happen like I said hey they're your best reliever is now done he's not able pitch drive you bring it tomorrow you're you're really risking his arm after throw in fifty pitches\nIn this game tonight but that's what's going to turn this into a series is that Milwaukee's relievers as good as they are you put that kind of stress on them that's really tough to say OK over a long series you got to get it done that's really hard yeah it's going to be curious\nTo watch now you're getting into the weighed Miley\nJody shut sheen will be neighbors their Fifteen game winner but he ... over the course of the year so a guy almost got the two hundred ending so perhaps that's your ... five or six innings guy that helps you uh get a little bit of rest for that ball and so they are quite as tax but\nWe're talking strength on strength right you'd say the top of the rotation was what the Dodgers were bringing not to mention all those bats but\nFor the brewers it's all about the bullpen mentioned the stat earlier than it was a one nine to your race in September first they've been fantastic\nOver the course of the season but now you you went went to the well very early Gonzalez not particularly sharp but it seemed like that was councils planning coming into this game get them a couple innings\nAnd then go from there and managing game for a game it's going to make for a very interesting series right we watch that with the Boston or New York series and wondering if the bullpen was going to be what eventually\nAnd did the red Sox instead the Yankees inability to hit the ball\nThe lack of long malls in the final two games and we watch it all yeah going down sixteen to one uh doesn't help matters but it never became about the red Sox bullpen here strength on straying we're going to see how much credit counseling can mix and match and and pull the strings here in short order\nEight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox winter out how about a fresco Mike it's rolling down the Jason Smith show with my best friend like Harmon a lot more on this game obviously as we continue on the Dodgers and the brewers game one of

Mike at swollen dome ... Smith show with my best friend my Carmen now earlier in the show keep you up in what's going on with the and they'll see us again still six for Milwaukee with lead they back in the bottom of the eighth inning\nHow big is Sunday\nThe big game of the week obviously the chiefs and the patriots and I I pick the chiefs of my upset special last hour on the show it's big because if Kansas City beach New England they really could go sixteen oh they do have the game in London coming up against the ... which is a big one for Kansas City but\nThey went in New England\nWho are they going to lose too right they beat Jacksonville\nHas too many offensive issues to really be a team that that they wind up having to compete with over the course of the rest of the season they won that battle last week I was amazed at how easy it was for them to score points I thought this is the deepest that's going to slow them down they did well in ... the claim\nLike morals well there are a lot of lake board other a lot of ... yeah well that ... club but the point is everybody's like oh we're going to get the no no he threw the ball to them yeah well they did a good job of Chechen kind of does that all the time though so it's no problem with it will turn back into Blake mortal as a reason\nThey represent in hell on the good place with great regularity\nThey went ... he and I will always have twenty four teams\nThey could go sixteen oh I mean they really 'cause I don't know that there's any team that could wind up eating them\nTheir officers running at such a high level I think they're going to win Sunday because of ... believe it or not he worked the patriots the last time and his debut a year ago and he's really starting to heat up a little bit now at a hundred and twenty yards two weeks ago at Ninety last week and a touchdown against the jaguars\nKareem hunter was not really been a weapon so far is starting to heat up and now suddenly it's like it's not fair you're heading up you're reading a lights out running back\nTo this I Know we always thought he'd be they're beginning of the year but clearly Patrick homes and his down field arm strength and is Aaron Rodgers abilities is what's really gained given everybody gotten everybody's attention but people forget how valuable and how good cream hunters and he's just starting to become that weapon now I mean they win this game sixteen to know\nIs in their site it's a tough one it's in New England it's a quarterback starting in his second year in ... no one's going to something crazy for them but they win this game sixteen oh could happen\nLittle Sony Michel start working on the ground game and slow it down and keep the homes on the sidelines pacing\nLike a cat waiting for his opportunity I doubt it usually gets after young quarterbacks fairly well uh and obviously we'll see what the patriots week too with Gordon everybody comes and I'm looking at\nAnd November fourth in Cleveland just for curiosity and I liked that Cleveland defensive do to make a lot of people were coming around doing so well we'll await that match up down the line and eventually another match up with the chargers probably with Joey ...\nSixteen and I don't watch out coming up next we got more in game one of the you know the U.S in a big quarterback decision in the NFL this is Fox Sports radio [noise]\nWe've all been there you're

more on car insurance\n\nOn our our radio ads [noise] download it now [noise]\n...\nYou can't put a lot of trust and this guy based upon his track record but they have the type of weapons to keep pace with the Kansas City chiefs I think that the talk of the chief going sixteen oh well that's going to end I Believe by the time the game ends on Sunday night\nI if I give ya a bucket of popcorn and a nice cross that bridge for those early games are you are you more excited to watch the return of Jim is Winston and the event land that can actually novel something together or is it Pittsburgh Cincinnati\nPittsburgh Cincinnati by far because you know in the Bengals have tried to really downplay the talk on the Steelers this week because\nAs well they should they've lost nine of tend to them you know and what's going to happen is you're going to have a Steeler take over at Paul Brown stadium probably have at least thirty thousand Steelers fans waving the towels things like that they've made it their second home in that position it has been and they had such success like I say winning the last nine out of ten and I think this is just a it's a great measuring stick for both\nYou know if Cincinnati wins then you've got to start considering this is like a legit team you know so far we haven't you know we you know they ... they played some fun football beating Atlanta beating Miami but\nFalcons in dolphins aren't exactly impressive I mean if they're able to beat the stores and that they're going to take charge and that division and ask for Pittsburgh\nIf they win look it shows that they can weather the storm that they can survive all the internal drama and that some things are good on defense and look\nThere there as long as TJ ... continues to get pressure and they're able to continue to blitz to cover up for the secondary they're fine that's what makes it such an interesting natural to me can spend goes off into blind hold up enough to get Andy Dalton a chance to connect with age eight green with Tyler boy I'm fascinated about that had an interesting talk with their cutter tonight\nI'm ... I'm sure he said he had NO PLAN whatsoever to play Jamie swinson against Chicago Bears\nAnd say okay now we put them out there for game do when they occur showing a great spot he's pissed off or game to he pitches great All right now they throw him out there for a game on the right decision by the Dodgers crush on game on on the road you don't know how are you is going to react on the road abuse going to react on the road so let's go ... game wanted to do it\nAnd he got beat and there's not a lot you can do when you were a best picture is out of the game and the third inning after giving up five runs there's not a lot you can that's why moving on from Clayton ... is what the Dodgers have to really look in doing this off season but the curiosity\nRide of how brilliant he's been in the in the regular season and you'll get his stats even it and he missed starts but still a two seven three you're right about\nFive and a half strike outs per walk still getting it done nine and five record and we we take wins and losses we were I think becoming more acceptable it's becoming more accepted that mold fans are going to screw you over\nA with great regularity in today's major league baseball so we don't look at the wins column quite as much as we used to but you got this game and they worked accounts you're looking at a pitch count that was elevated before he departed they they did a good job of grinding out at bats\nAnd let's face it the defense did him no favors along the way as well but you go three batters into the fourth and he's gone and now it becomes the the larger question for the Dodgers of should they have gone in and tried to pick him off for a second straight round and even if he was on his regular rest\nBut for me you're talking pushing forward you got ... you you got your you've got a number of free agency or you can go look at in Kabul things together instead of spending\nThirty million dollars now you still need guys to get to the dance and Clinton crush a still get you there yeah and then that becomes the large but his at a thirty three million dollar\nCog in your machine especially when you know come playoff time we've got to add some very hard conversations but you can be the number one you can be that symbolic guy and you can pitch opening day at Dodger Stadium\nHere it is we play the old voiceover Vince ... says it's time for a Dodgers baseball it can we take her shop for another five years that's all fine and good\nBut come playoff time winning time\nFive hundred you got a flip the coin as to what Clinton her show you're going to get makes for a difficult proposition unless you're just knowing All right we might get five we might get to that is not a nice no way that's and that's that's not even a number three guy at this point\nNo and also look at it this way if you're the Dodgers if if if you disagree with my perspective on Clinton Herschel can the Dodgers get to the playoffs without Clinton ... Shaw damn right they can they did it during the play on the world series run two years ago he was hurt he had an okay you get a good year this year but he's still you miss a lot of starts\nThey still one Ninety two games they can get to the play if you can get to the playoffs without Clinton Kirk show why are you paying and thirty three million dollars a year\nWhile you're doing that it's it's they they tried they tried for a long time to say you're our guy your horse and they've given them so many chances and now it's a toss up every time he picks them at\nEight NATO about four to three or four two three four to five year a in the last twenty six starts so significant sample size you're looking at\nA a pitcher who's had his injuries three straight years a hundred and Seventy five innings pitch or if you were up for the last five for that matter so for Clinton Kirsch of is the love of the city and what he meant and he's done a lot of good here\nIn where we were just died and we work out of the Los Angeles studios here uh brought you buy guy go here for Fox Sports radio or you know and then we got some crushed folks walking around the hallways year after that that outing that the fact that he left in the fourth and we're gonna have to you got to find some consolation later on on this Friday night\nA we'll have more on this game coming up in a minute but meanwhile the person who may wind up finding her car keyed bono is dead car with what's happening [laughter] she walked down the hallway a few minutes ago and we have our editors are are\nBig time Dodger fans they're both wearing Clayton cursed Shaw jurors used to work the night and I said I'm saying that the guys hey tough one how do you guys meal and you know and and Eric and rights and listen to you know at least here is not going to pitch tomorrow okay we're talking for a couple of minutes and that just walks down wow\nWhat a game that was fun and I don't [laughter] but you can you see the jury these they're wearing or what do what a game W cars getting heat I'm Sorry I allow\n... you know what it was an amazing finish the game and I'm Sorry guys we may have lost in the capital of the editors and associate producer is a long way they may have been airing out in the courtyard somewhere\nWill rebuild the drama for you that has that last chance for the Dodgers they travel by just one courtesy of Chris Taylor's RBI triple ...
