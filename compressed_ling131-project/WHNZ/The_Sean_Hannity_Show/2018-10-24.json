they're looking into the couriers that were used to drop off some of these packages like the packages like the one that was at CNN\nUm apparently it was when they say it was handled liver and at the store us residents\nI read one report that said it was placed in the mailbox I'd I have not seen any reports where in it it's dated at that as a courier was used but I Would imagine that they're going to be able to find a if there was a courier use\nIf it was a service or if it was somebody through the postal service I'm I'm pretty sure they'd be able to find who paid for that\nUm anyway and and a figure out if I'm a ... basically\nWho organized et cetera from there I haven't heard any more developments in terms of new packages being discovered\n[noise] I haven't seen any more of those so that um\nYou know more of their their then no I mean that I I haven't seen any can have you I have not seen any other development of other uh packages and with the awareness so high you would think we and I'm watching I'm watching everything and I will call Andrew Cuomo had said earlier\nThat this was that he had received a ... device in quote\nBut [noise] that it was\nUm ended up the NYPD said it was a an informational brochure just some literature they said so it wasn't a device so it goes from seven to six total which is still that but it's not seven at sex\nSo this um we're just going to kind of keep an eye on all of it and bring you a new development that we get but\nSadly as the as the investigation is is on going out of the media is getting ridiculous as you can imagine\nAs you can imagine [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd we'll follow all of that let's kick it really fast and just in Florida Man\nAnd discuss this with me and a nationwide audience eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's the nationwide number here on the net eight hundred to eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on the program\n[noise] ah ... you know on a personal note I Am\nWhenever I'm In New York city studio when I'm In the New York studios I Walk by the CNN Time Warner center\nEvery day I just went by there\nJust a little while ago I Walk by not fifty eighth street is back open the north side of the street which is on fifty eight straight or just before Columbus Circle and that's where the the curve Time Warner building is that's where the CNN New York operations are\nAnd you know hop off the train and Columbus Circle there and I walk right\nTo you know right\nOn the outside of that building there's a there's a subway stairs that come up right there and then it depends which entrance and I I use different entrances depending on the day if I Want to stop me so ah but I literally walk right by the CNN\nOr Time Warner centered just a short time ago and the media's all over the place hey another reason to follow me on Twitter 'cause when something like this happens obviously I'm going to opine I'm going to tweet in this case I was just right there so I took a whole bunch of pictures and I tweeted pictures out\nIn fact the [laughter] the you know what this is the the you know if this is right here there's there's official CNN pipe bomber incident police NYPD caution tape\nIt is for sale if you'd like to buy this caution tape a highest\nBetter right now eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine this is from the event folks\nOr or maybe I'll just put it up on me but I'm kidding around it but it's not for sale I'm joking but soon as this is from the events and all that did you did you are destroyed police property that you take down some of the caution tape no this was in the street because they push the perimeter back\nSeveral times and this apparently was up\nAnd then they pulled it down because they extend the perimeter when the N. Y. T. a PD bomb disposal truck when they were leaving I order when they were bringing the bomb out the the pipe bomb or the suspicious package\nI wasn't listening is like at a level of city block I mean it would probably blow somebody's face off\nA and and their fingers in hands off but if if it were if it's a viable bombing and authorities have said that at least the George Soros bomb was viable but now this was in history and I didn't rip it down but not this is real this is official a police are NYPD cautions have from the incident\nWhich I collected just a little while ago\nSo now I did say a couple of pictures those are on my Twitter feed again you ought to follow me on Twitter folks at Todd Smith\nMight square is at T. O. D. D. S. C. H. N. I. T. T. N. as in November Todd snip at Todd Schmidt 'cause I took several pictures of the media throngs and actually if you were watching cable news earlier\nThere was a bomb disposal truck that was parked in to a doorway into a an inference garage or that goes into the underground parking area and the service area of the time Warner center and I walked by that every day\nAnd that's where the bomb disposal truck was that side of the street is still blocked off but I was able to walk on the south side on fifty a street or on the ah the south side of the time Warner center and I took some pictures again I tweet it all these out and they're on my Twitter feed\nAt Todd ... AT T O D day at the age and I teach the now ... we're going to phones here and just a bit I Want to go over the facts as we know them\nI'm looking at\nThe the current rundown of who got suspicious packages now this goes back to yesterday and the George Soros story and I said flat out I said loud and clear on the show that I deplore George sources politics\nThe money he spends a the ideas he tries to a push and foment I don't like George Soros at all I don't want any injury or ill will or hurt to come to George Soros I can still be vehemently opposed to his political strategies and ideas and his uh\nActivism and his funding but I don't want the guy blown up by a pipe bomb nor do I want any of his staff\nAnd that's why I was very clear on yesterday's program that there is no place no room whatsoever for whoever put this in George Soros his mailbox\nIn northern Westchester county in New York that I Hope that they are apprehended and brought to justice and then of course here we are twenty four hours later and we're discussing all these other pipe bombs which authorities believe that it's all related\nNow the interesting thing on the sorrows\nPipe bomb I came to mind none of these have detonated and that's incredible\nAnd you know as far as this ought to be a treasure trove of clues I mean even if they did explode there should be\nA ton of clues on these on detonated bombs in packages that hopefully authorities will you be able to hone in on\nWhoever did this and we'll go over those details in just a second but with the Soros package there are numerous reports that they believe that that package might have been home delivered and placed in his mailbox\nSo I mean that bring somebody maybe to the scene or is it a career was the actual bomb maker was it some do that was just pain to deliver a package you know who knows\nBut I hand deliver and then we have what happened today so the sorrows a package then we have what was delivered to CNN which caused this huge evacuation of the CNN New York headquarters at Columbus Circle\nAnd a fifty eighth and fifty nights for\nA\n... this this ... this this building is a humongous building restaurants and shops there there's more there's a giant whole foods in the basement of the time Warner center which is as you I Would avoid that one at all costs by the way\nYou've got CNN with their studios it's just a a lot of activity you've got residential and the time Warner center so you've got a hotel the or is it the Mandarin is is on me the north side I mean the places a gigantic complex they used to be the old New York coliseum which was abandoned in shuttered for years I used to walk by that\nWhen I used to work at W. P. O. J. radio back in Nineteen Ninety One and Nineteen Ninety two I used to live right down the street\nSo it's a beautiful complex so CNN or they get this package but the curious thing on the CNN package it was addressed to John Brennan\nFormer CIA director John Brennan very outspoken very critical of President Trump but the issue is here John Brennan does not work for CNN\nJohn Brennan is contracted to MSNBC and remember when he had a security clearance strip by President Obama by a by President Trump brother he had his security clearance I was a big story so was this intentional or what was this just a goof up\nSo to to send the pipe bomb to John Brennan chair of CNN at ten Columbus Circle of New York New York one double o two three whenever there's a ... I you know that that was was it a goof\nThat was that a mistake because if they were trying to set the John Brennan a trip and care of M. S. N. B. C. and not\nCNN also in the pack and sent to CNN and John Brennan there's also some kind of a white powder in an envelope so not only the explosive device but also some type of white powder then another package was sent\nTo Hillary Clinton an explosive device was sent to the Clinton residents in chapter ... also west Chester county not far from Soros\nAnd that was in throughout a intercepted by the secret service member rock Obama\nA was sent to his Washington DC residents upper rock Obama was also the recipients of one of these explosive devices as well on the latest now is Maxine Waters aid package was intercepted at the congressional mail facility\nAnd that was apparently address the Maxine Waters are very outspoken we you know we don't need to go over a you know her issues and problems\nUh Eric Holder and this is where things get even more interesting\nThere was a report that Eric Holder and got a suspicious package and Debbie Wasserman Schultz got a suspicious package here's the deal\n[noise] [noise] yeah the package was addressed Hey Eric holder\nBut the package was attempted to be delivered to Eric Holder the address was not a good address and it was return to the sender\nAnd whoever this little joker is that's doing these pipe bombs and packages they put Debbie Wasserman Schultz is sunrise Florida congressional office as the return address that to suggest that Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the package they're called but no that wasn't the case\nSo the package goes back was that little added little joke kind of like the blues brothers and ah they gave the address of of ah Wrigley Field now you know ... uh ten sixty west Alice in whatever it was that the whole deal here with the the Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nReturn address so that gets return because it was on deliverable to the Eric Holder address\n... but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't have ...

of the nation wide number here on Schmidt\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine I Want to go to phones here and Graham our our first calls it a day momentarily couple of other things that I Want to go over briefly I Want to remind you that virtually if I'm not mistaken\nThe entire Trump family\nHave received threats not just virtually\nAh 'cause I Know that there have been threats on Twitter against a Donald Trump junior and his kids in the family but\nAll of the Trump family members of I'm not mistaken ever seen threatening male including a white powder to emulate anthrax scare the Trump family I remember\nEarlier this year there was a Massachusetts man he was charged with sending in on below which was sent to Donald Trump junior\nAnd ah that's one that his wife and opened up\nAnd I I Believe there was a maybe some ... white powder and that but there was a known if I'm not mistaken that said ah you're getting what you deserve something to that effect but they all received\nThreats and and white powder Eric Trump has Donald Trump junior all kinds of threats against the president obviously so you know this this goes both ways not listen to it takes you to a whole new level if somebody is mailing\nExplosive devices and according to the authorities or at least with the the Soros device we heard yesterday and and this morning that the device sent that George Soros his house or was potentially a viable explosive device but what's interesting here is that\nNone of these devices have detonated is that intentional or is that due to a clumsiness on the bomb maker not knowing what they're doing what are these meant to demonstrate that they caught him detonated but\nThey decided to not let the packages detonate upon the opening of the packages was all this is yet to be determined if you're on hold hang on going to grab your calls you and just a second this is going to be a pretty damn heavy topic\nAs you know the series rolling in and everyone's pointing fingers yeah all the Democrats did this it's a false flag they're trying to make it look like it's a\n... a loony tunes Trump supporter or uh it's you know a Trump supporter going after the Democrat who could be somebody that has no care whatsoever the just a sick individual trying to stir stuff up\n[noise] the president has spoken out I've got some audio here before we take your calls when I Want to play a little a little bit of audio\n[noise] ah the president at the event at the White House a little while ago uh the president was signing an opioid bill so at the event he addressed what's going on so here's a little bit of President Trump from a couple of hours ago\n[noise] actually begin today's remarks by providing an update on the suspicious packages and devices meld to current and former high ranking government officials to safety of the American people is my highest an absolute priority\nI have just concluded a briefing with the FBI\nYeah a prophet of Justice Department of homeland security and the U.S Secret Service as we speak the packages are being his affected by top explosive experts in a major federal investigation is now underway\nTo full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct just investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to tell you that in these times we have to unify we have to come together and said one very clear strong unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nI'm also opposed to and we need to repel at the border I don't think that's the cause\nI Do because they're so desperate\nOkay so do you think that the Democrats have quickly put pipe bombs together to send to their very own to distract us from the illegal alien caravan and caravans out because we told them at the second a couple of days ago uh you you really believe that\nI Do because it I'm not saying they had at that I think it's somebody that's on that cannot crack side\nIt was like yeah I don't think that this has to take our eyes off the caravan was what motivates somebody to do this I don't know until we find them and\nI'm confident they will but again I so you're not suggesting it's somebody part of the Democratic machine you're you're you're suggesting is somebody democratic sympathetic that's trying to take our eyes off the caravan\nI think yeah I think they're just doing that to distract tram stopping the caravans\nYeah well I don't see I don't see how this would distract the president from doing the right thing and making sure that the caravan does not bust into the United states ... a chow Sheila ... how long have you lived in show

the far left imports more till after me who did send like\nUm bombs or you know dangerous packages\nTo someone who is a conservative you know I wouldn't support that I wouldn't have done that I Would say that's a false like I Would think I was horrible when we sold you know this mindset that someone could in on the far right not not all consumers but someone deranged on the far right can send a bomb threat to someone who's like George chores\nOr to Obama yeah that that's happened there's not chops on both sides\nJerry would be ... it could be anybody we don't know and I'm not going to jump to conclusions I'll talk about the possibilities I'll talk about all of a series of people are floating like you know Judy we just had on but I'm not going to make any statement of fact\nI'm not going to stick my neck I prefer to responsible let's find out the facts and let the investigation proceed and hopefully they'll be in a raft of will figure out what kind of a a sick oh did this\nRight now you investigated but\nOne thing I disagree with you is that the idea that nothing that I'm Trump that I'm not saying Trump purposely encourage the person but Trump has permitted hatred Trump has permitted\nFear Trump liked him courses like a congressman tax reporter talks about attacking keep all during his rallies he called you and me I'm an American people journalists\nYou'll have to think this has nothing to do with her\nMother ... Jerry Jerry listen uh is the president responsible in my chest ties in of I ... as you know I voted for Trump I don't always agree with Trump\nAnd I'm not afraid on this show is a conservative American and a broadcast I'm not afraid to tell you when Trump is knocking it and in the park and when he's a strike now and I I Do both on a regular basis but ah Jerry a\nCouple of things as far as you know the the congressman in the body slamming I spoke out against that the the the gene forte rally in Montana\nAnd I I don't think that it's funny to make fun of that that was that was a battery and that's and that's not that's not funny but again I'm not willing to suggest that the president because\nHe has been unconventional or he is fomenting anger and riled up crowds and he's turned crowds against ah the opposite side or the media\nI'm not gonna even jump on the possibility yet that the Trump cause this individual to send these ah these pipe bombs in the mail or have them delivered Jerry thanks for the call let's go to Boise idaho\nAnd Frank Frank you're next on Schmidt hello\nHello Frank here yeah I I just wanted to make a point that none of these people saw Obama Hillary Clinton none of these people when's the last time that they go get their own mail\nThere ... they don't go out to their mailbox and pick up their male so this was a a worthless attempt at attention that's all I see from it and that's really all I have to say\nWell Frank Frank was a good point because you're right I don't think sources going out to collect his mail order or the Clintons so if these devices went off most likely or it could have affected and hurt whatever help for employee they have\nUnless it was put in a pile and then the Clinton's did open up the mail but I have and they probably have people do that as well but on until well are well taken\nPoint [noise]\nWarning sign to eleven twelve fifty W agency [noise]\nAttention all authors page publishing is looking for authors have you were in the book and want to get it published based publishing we'll get your book into bookstores and for sale on line at Amazon apple I do in other outlets they handle all aspects of the publishing process for you\nPrinting ... publicity copyright an editing go eight hundred fines or one thirty six eighty nine now for your free author submission get that seat under advisor or one thirty six eighty nine for your free author certainly shouldn't get again eight hundred buys or one thirty six eighty nine\nI'm anything scaring me kid vampires where ... children not one bit but you know it does scare me downtime inefficiency scares the living daylights out of me that's why use Granger are America's number one source for industrial supplies plus they've got the inventory management solutions that keep us running\nSo we've got up time we've got efficiency we've got productivity when it comes to keeping your facility running rangers got your back\nColor click ranger dot com to see for yourself Granger for the ones who get it done\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with Rachel you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origin nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing ratio\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin rock and words they didn't compares in public records which will approve only balance or thirty or purchase turns actions ... information conditions equal housing Leonard licensing office he said and wants timber thirty thirty additional conditions or loses may apply by\nMS R.

the device was originally sent the first one was George Soros yesterday then we have CNN evacuations Time Warner center in Columbus Circle in New York City in Manhattan\nAnd that was addressed to John Brennan at CNN\nBut of course John Brennan is a paid contributor to MSNBC so they got the network wrong a package sent to bill and Hillary Clinton's house in ...\nYou had a package Santa Brock Obama's residents a package apparently was sent the Maxine Waters the firebrand or a congressional Democrat from California\nAnd that package was intercepted at the congressional mail facility we have the package that was addressed Eric Holder but was miss addressed and then was sent to the singer and the return address was Debbie Wasserman Schultz in sunrise Florida\nAnd of course Debbie Wasserman Schultz didn't send this\nAnd uh so that's why we that's where we stand right now on the packages that have been set and the question is have any been undiscovered how many packages if any are still out there undiscovered or under limited at this point we're just waiting in a mailbox or on a desk or wherever\nI welcome back to Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine will go to phones right now again thanks for your patients everyone held on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of course the theories which again I'm a jumping on any bandwagon here but I'll tell you when people are talking about\nThat the Democrats have done this or a Democrat or a liberal sympathetic to democratic causes\nAn anti Trump a Democrat has done this as a false flag so then Republicans or conservative or a Trump trained supporter can be blamed or did I did a Trump supporter do this and target Democrats and of\nCourse the other area of talking point is that well what do you expect Trump is is fomenting this violence on Trump's discourse in ah these rallies that he's holding at AOL calling the media the enemy of the people\nOf folks come on I mean to suggest something is simplistic is that the that causes someone to do this\nThat's preposterous now I Wish that Trump would tone down their rhetoric I sat on day one\nThat man he had a whole lot of ... going on during the the campaigning I now turn it off I stick to your guns follow your policies which I I like the president's policies\nAnd I wanted him to become more presidential obviously as he does he ah you know went on with the job and certainly I\nWish she would have changed as some of the tenor and some of the discourse because he he was he's the president I mean you know you don't you don't have to be in campaign mode just get your agenda done and you can do that\nWhile not being as predictable and we tell me a little more presidential but again I Am not at all comfortable with suggesting that oh Trump caused the pipe bombs because ah he wants people beaten up early he talks about the media being the end of the people give me a break\nSo I'm I'm a jumping on that bandwagon a eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on snap back to the phones and let's let's do along sunk a calls here riches next in white plains New York rich you are on ... and I\nTaught me to disagree with you on two fronts well\nFirst of all you know I think it's perfectly within the realm of possibility that Trump's reading Rick could inspire somebody to do this you're saying you know the the way you frame it is that that this is absolutely it I'm saying that there hasn't been anybody as a noxious ... as president\nI'm as Trump in history okay and on the other front with regard to the Democrats being or a Democrat sympathizer\nBeing responsible for the bombs I think that's within the realm of possibility just by virtue of the fact we're so close less than two weeks away from a major election\nI Want some rich as I've said I've laid out everything you just said I laid out what everyone is discussing or the realm of possibilities here on who the purpose is with these pipe bombs but I'm not going to jump on any particular theory\nI'll discuss what the possibilities are but it's too early just let the investigation happen\nYet but I mean yuletide everyone likes to guess and you know if I guess you know that guy I mean it really think it's a coincidence that these things happened less than two weeks before major election I don't believe in coincidence is like that\nNo I listen to how about the Access Hollywood tape being leaked just a couple of weeks before the election uh between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump back in twenty sixteen\nOh I don't believe in coincidence is that I'm sure whoever did this was trying to disrupt the process but again we have no idea who this is there is a slew of possibilities on what their intentions motivations are what drove them what inspired them at this point I\nDon't know rich thanks for the call let's go to California now Robert is in van ... hello Robert Iran Smith\nHello good afternoon I'm I'm fairly convinced that this is happening just because of the elections coming up\nAnd I guarantee you sorrell Feinstein last minute you're ... or they have really know what's going on and I can guarantee you

doing the last minute with Kavanaugh\nHung on our lives lost their lives you know ... ... ... ... Robert there's no doubt about it and I\nStood on top of this microphone and yelled at firing of Dianne Feinstein was disgusting and despicable the way that went down with Kavanaugh holding on to that information the information was leaked it was not going to get me started on that again I\nDeplore what she does what she did what she stands for for the most part but Robert what I'm saying is\nAre you you're suggesting that Dianne Feinstein had you had knowledge of of this this plot\nToday that somebody in the realm of the senators\nAnd what she represents knows what's going on one of those people whether it's Obama that was was that was sent you George Soros only the ... now I hear you we won't find out who got it we will not find out and you know no longer with us for\nI think we're going to find that I think there's going to be enough trace evidence they're going to be able to find a common thread it's going to be something\nSilly that they overlooked I think the purpose is going to be found I I Am guessing there is going to be an arrest in this matter but to suggest that any elected Democrat\nWho um you know ... for the most part uh ideologically on the complete opposite side of the spectrum as these individuals I Can't sit here and say that yeah I'm sure it's a foregone conclusion that some by senator congressional Democrats knew about this plot to ... to ...\nAll the credit cards you have all you have way too high of an interest rate so what you're going to save by not paying through the nose with interest with a much lower rate\nIt's it's serious money folks over the course of the year that's why it light dream is a no brainer if you've got a ton of credit card debt or just one card to court five course whatever\nMy listeners can save even more with an additional interest rate discount on top of light streams already low rates and the only way to get this discount is to go to light streamed dot com slash Todd\nSo at the lights scream dot com slash my main taught that L.

off that they want to make you feel like you're somebody else or or something but but say the Republicans are the Democrats did this as some wiped out hack\nYeah and it was a giant and I I've taken that position and I've heard the callers make their comments and have the series but I've been very clear from the beginning of the show today\nJust wait for the investigation whether it's a DNA left

nose pliers invitations to see if they can find out what the tool they used and you know they they there are so many angles that we probably don't even think of on on\nHow they're investigating this and Jerry I tell me if I'm guessing that when that pipe bomb was removed from CNN put on the NYPD bomb disposal truck\nAnd taken to the Bronx I'm guessing they probably the ATF was right there and the FBI with them I'm guessing they probably didn't detonate that they probably want to take part in tax write\nAn essay apart in the van oh yeah\nAgain I I work twenty seven years straight yeah Wallace was just assemble and they're looking at wiring they're looking at the I I'm from ... from my own as you're telling me that the loss of shrapnel but no no way that made up\nA bill so they may put some

especially since a lawyer has released text showing he accepted tickets to Hamilton from an undercover agent\nWhat we are we know what happened here now that's why he's been so invasive that's why he lashed out and the debate because he knew um that that that that he was a not on the right side of the facts here\nGillum insists the new information shows he's telling the truth\nUh we did go ah to
