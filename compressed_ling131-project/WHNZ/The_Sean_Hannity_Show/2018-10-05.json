attack process has been it's really nauseated may and\nYou look at Kavanaugh's judicial record you look at all of those that said that his qualifications were matched unparalleled so I Do apologize Audrey from my moment of weakness a last week when I said\nWhen I when I said oh Mike oh my God I I I Can't believe what's what's going on here and remember what else did I Do you remember what else I said along around that same time\nAfter the FBI investigation was agreed to\nAnd Jeff Flake remember a lot of conservatives a lot of Republicans were very aggravated Jeff Flake\nFor that little meeting that little sidebar that little Hungary had with Chris Collins Democrat from Delaware\nAnd that uh when I say cool our college I cuckoo's run I've got Susan Collins on the brain so when when flake met with Chris Coons from Delaware and they came up with this plan All right a flake wants a one week or a FBI investigation\nYou know what I said I also said at that moment on this program oh my God\nI think Jeff Flake just saved Brett Kavanaugh on this program and remember\nWas getting yelled at from coal and saying\nThat want to get to why you agree to the FBI investigation why are you saying that one flight\nDid was a good thing why because I was a hundred percent right in that I told you that with this little a scheme that flake and coups had hatched up no pun intended on or had a that\nThis is going to be the saving grace this is going to say uh the nomination and it happened\nThe flake win over so also who knows I Wonder if he's getting cramped from Democrats biggest this little coups flight maneuver that helped save\n... so a cooling Democrat he essentially has some responsibility and the fact that Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed as the next a next Supreme Court justice here but it's it's simple folks\nJeff Flake out going flake who has enraged many Republicans and conservatives flake saved cabinet all you must realize that Audrey do you understand that\nOh yes I Do and I called his office and encouraged him even though he was leaving the Senate that what is done now will affect us even now we don't live in his state\nAnd listen and Audrey I had people when I made the statement after we have this crazy maneuver or late last week on the FBI investigation and flake having the caviar on voting for a cabin on the full floor where he voted to to uh\nWithin the vote that he did make and then a green that we have to have is one week investigation when I said that flake his move was brilliant and this is actually going to save capital I had numerous calls on this show last friday\nI was getting yelled at that what do you do it while you're I mean I was getting yelled at what is now because they wanted me to just attack\nFlights and I'm

was like a a legal arguments from a brilliant attorney laid out from it and ... and getting from point a to point lead and get\nFirmly in squarely across the finish line before she announced that she would vote for cabinet are just incredible well [noise] you knew this was common\nSo with Collins and a brilliant delivery and her affirmation that she'll vote for Kavanaugh we have this\n[noise]
