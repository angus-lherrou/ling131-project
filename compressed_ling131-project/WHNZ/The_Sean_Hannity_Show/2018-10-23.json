a lighter note but certainly a significant note for many people especially those that are spending disposable income\nWhen some people probably should spend the money elsewhere because the odds of winning this mega millions lottery\nSo astronomically ridiculous but here we are again and I wanted to put a couple of things in perspective and yes am I going to buy a twenty bucks worth of mega millions tickets on the way out of the studio tonight\nI guess I I I Will so a one point six billion dollars is the estimated a jackpot but to put things into\nA a framework of understanding with all of the people all of the Americans across all of the states that and it's most of the states that have a mega millions um [noise] you realize that on last friday's drawing\nThat only fifty nine percent of the possible combinations were taken\nThat means that forty percent or\nForty one percent if you want to be a hundred percent I forty one percent or so of the possible combinations number wise were not chosen so that's why there was nowhere on Friday nights is clearly obviously nobody picked the winning ... but the point is with\nThis many Americans playing mega millions it shows you\nHow astronomical the odds are yes I Know you've got to be in it too when it and yeah there's always some uh you know of folks working in a meat factory that uh their their pool are one or you you you know the stories that that surface on these things but it just grass this the\nHands and tens and tens and tens of millions of Americans buying tickets spending not just the two bucks for a ticket but spending twenty bucks fifty bucks some people and what happens is you know there's a there's a disproportionate number of those that are\nNot well off and they're squeezing to make ends meet that that buy lottery tickets whether it's the uh you know the scratch your tickets\nOr you know these type of drawings and a lot of folks that are just dreaming or spending money that they probably should be using for other things 'cause well their budgets are tight\nAnd they're scraping by as is and just have a lot of folks in those boats that\nI end up spending a ridiculous amount on these lotteries when the chances of winning below their terrible so again I mean this is this is mind boggling last friday the femur this huge fever was a billion dollars\nAnd with all the people playing still forty one percent of the possible combinations\nWere chosen either manually by people or the computer's just randomly spinning out the tickets I mean that is that was that's daunting and listen to this the estimation by the mega millions folks and I think it's drawn in Atlanta\nI I think that's where they do the mega millions are drawing but by tonight\nBy this evening lottery officials for mega millions only estimate that Seventy five percent\nAre going to be sold of the possible combinations that leaves a a a four twenty five percent of the possible combinations\nWon't be sold so does ah\nIn the Seventy five percent sold is that going to contain ah\nThe winning tickets or tickets or is this jak pocket a probably climb to want two billion dollars over two billion dollars by by friday if there's no winter tonight or winners tonight I I Know it's it's\nI find that the numbers are are are just staggering on how\nUnlikely it is I mean you've heard all the deal yeah you're

somebody ends up winning these things at some point but again\nThe odds are just so astronomically against you and then uh one of the things that I saw a well reading a whole variety of stories on the

Connecticut New York or New Jersey Delaware and Marilyn ...\nAnd I said I Am certain kind of I don't like the idea ... terrible and I've\nJust I've just said look are being facetious\nHere I Know I Know a lot of cotton listen day my God I Know You're Joking around and I appreciate you thought you know you put a lot of thought into it but I listen and I'm sure you ultimately agree with what I'm about to say I don't want them in the country don't don't put them anywhere 'cause you know just as you you know you have an idea of ...\nAnd I know you're being facetious I Know that this is just a hypothetical kind of a joke type scenario but you know if you didn't put them in California they wouldn't stay contained in California they all over the place you couldn't lock them in and and then they'd be moving all or we don't want the illegal aliens in this country the fact is\nThat if you want to come to this country legally you do with the proper way and\nI realized that some of them are making here but guess what we can't take every body I don't want 'em here I don't want him any or less they come to this country the correct way also they're welcome to America They're welcome here if\nThey immigrate to this country in the legal proper fashion but you know even with your kind of funny a scenario I I wouldn't even want to bring them anywhere or to the the continental United States because they're illegals they don't belong\nTo not be able to stop them the military I'm telling you I was in the military I was a joint service commands\nI'm here to tell you they will not be able to stop that number of people they're just they're just it's just the way you're going to be able to stop them and if you do stop him it's going to be carnage people will die and then we're going to get slaughtered in in the in the eyes of the American people as far as as far as\nYour as perceptions years no way you're going to stop that number of people if seven thousand people are trying to you know rush across the border we don't have\nWe don't have the resources of stopping them what are you gonna what are you going for the guy was like a ... you're you're going to put seven thousand of our soldiers on the border to play to play a linebacker just to to take each one of these people down not going to happen it's just not going to happen I don't want them in this country any more than you do\nNot like it's going to be fascinating to see what happens if they do make it to our southern border if they are able to infiltrate and what the president does you know as far as declaring a national emergency if you have seven thousand people\nThat are trying to break into the country\nOr in a in a mob fashion\nI Do consider that a national emergency and I consider that within the purview of the president's powers to protect the United states and our borders they thanks for the call I appreciate it let's grab to Steve Steve's next in North Hampton Pennsylvania steam welcome to the program I\nAre you doing good afternoon I was totally take it back to the afternoon news started to worry about the show today knowing a little bit of history you speak out against the king of Saudi Arabia or any ... in that region has to do it there was Muslim and he was on the religions you do your feet by the end of the short\nI started laughing when I told my wife I said they probably called him up and fed him to the dogs to get rid of all the evidence\nI was just taken aback by all the speculation on what's going on with us\nBecause if you would speak out against the king as one voice\nYou would be automatically executed one way or another because you're one forties could lead to a civil insurrection into the Arab kingdoms ... together over there with Iran\nAnd it's just

University in the u._k. is pushing to ban this along with several other costumes sang they cause a fence\nThat their inappropriate um and it goes on to sort of with the things that you you're you're not allowed to dress like Harvey Weinstein [laughter]\nRight so let me they're talking about Halloween costumes let me forward in I Need to go about four minutes in here and Megan Kelly starts talking about a Diana Ross costume\nRight so then back to the firemen with an accent in and says nine carrying the X. around here comes when\nI hear your controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she is Diana Ross and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people said that that was racist and\nShe wants to look like they interrupt her one day I I don't know how like that race on Holloway guys walking around I have seen it here either\nI don't think she really wanted to look like they had to rush ... says Michael Jackson [laughter]\nAnother call come out in the event literally all night\nSo that's what happened and people talk Megan Kelly as saying that she really do have a problem with this woman on the real housewives of whatever a darkening the skin with makeup to look more like Diana Ross\nNow again it it wasn't like a a minstrel show black face I mean really offensive deal and the question is Megan Kelly was saying is that really raises anyway firestorm ensues and Megan Kelly has now issued an apology\nFor\nEveryone's calling in her blackface comments but she didn't really say black face she was just talking about she dark skinned to make yourself look like Diana Ross so Megan Kelly\nIssued an internal email an apology email today which we happen to have a copy of a courtesy of media I they got it\nWhere she apologizes to her colleagues in those inside NBC for what happened where she appeared to defend\nA costume I'm Diana Ross in some degree of a a complex and darkening and no one's using again black face but I don't see it as black face per se and I ... I mean that that ... that's ... that's like black face\nSo anyway Megan Kelly writes\nThis email their friends and teammates\nOne of the wonderful things about my job is that I get the chance to express and hear a lot of opinions today is one of those days were listening carefully to other points of view including from friends and colleagues is leading need to rethink my own ideas\nWhen we have the roundtable discussion earlier today about the controversy of making your face looked like a different race as part of a Halloween costume I suggested that this seemed okay you have done\nAs part of this holiday where people have the chance to make themselves look like others the iconic Diana Ross came up as as an example to me I thought why would it be controversial to some of dressing up as Diana Ross to make yourself\nLook like this amazing woman as a way of honoring and respecting her\nI realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong and I'm Sorry the history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent\nThe moon's too deep and again and that's why I brought up a you know the minstrel and the uh I said minstrel not menstrual uh and and the black face you know different than the Diana Ross however I ... I can understand why\nOr my assumption is or the way to make it was quite different than a a real true offensive nasty black face but I there's a lot of sensitivity out there and you know these days you should know better I mean for instance when I take\nWhat I take up your brown makeup and try I wouldn't do it 'cause I Know that that's a no no\nI like to know how 'bout silver ... enter enter when it was the silver screen with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor when Gene Wilder they grab the brown shoe polish and he puts it on in order to try to get past the authorities\nAnd he is you know we bad we better get to the boom box on his shoulder and I mean it just it was ridiculous looking\nSo Megan Kelly finishes up\nNever been a PC kind of person but I understand that we need to do more sensitive or we need to be more sensitive\nOr in this day and age particularly on race and ethnicity issues which far from being healed had been exacerbated in our policies over the past year this is a time for more understanding loves sensitivity and honor and I want to be part of that I look forward to continuing that discussion I'm\nHonored to work with all of you every day\nLove M. K. so I guess uh she calls herself M. K. which is Megan Kelly so again the discussion of\nA\nYou know the the Diana Ross controversy a you know she also it also became a won his race is\nShe says because you get in trouble if you're white person who puts on black face on Halloween or a black person for a person who puts on white face on Halloween\nWhen I was a kid that was okay as long as you were dressing up like a character so I I Want to grab I Want to grab that chunk of audio as well so I'll play that coming up and just the Ben also phones are loaded here if you're on hold and I'm also going to grab your phone's your momentarily and we'll get to that all coming up in minutes\nIran Schmidt's a standby hey um\n[noise] well I I don't know as soon as you said that Megan Kelly say there was no black sand I don't recall that you want to look that up let me know hey folks are sponsor is light scream\nAnd I want to tell you right now that I'm confident that many of you listening if you've got credit card debt that you are paying way too much in the a PR the annual percentage rate the interest that you're paying\nGee a surprisingly so uh there is a boat storage right at twenty feet from my house and all that got destroyed boats and were pulled into our yard aluminum metal siding from the roof of the structure\nThat was that's a big problem was that was that the big boat tell that it's all collapsed\n[noise] now that I'm not all collapsed partially a that Governor and that is right around the corner\nStatue while while because I saw the aerial shots Jacob yeah what was it ...
