question and that we might have some fun open up the phone lines and and have people try to guess what is that sound\nOn a very serious note here that the show he thing I Want to open up phones early on ... and the situation that we're in here in the United states with our allies the Saudis I reluctantly call them allies because\nI've always been suspicious of the Saudis I still am suspicious of the Saudis there an amount of nine eleven conspiratorial is at all but there there's more inside the Saudi royal family with a knowledge to nine eleven\nThat I truly believe and also remember in the nine eleven commission report\nWe have all of that stuff regarding Saudi Arabia and the Saudi royal family and there's an absolute monarchy this autocracy or redacted\nThat leaves the nice a big black lines that are are blacked out and with the Saudis a lot of stuff was just block down so what is it that we're not allowed to see regarding the Saudis I've always thought that\nThey were a very um you know what have you done for me lately or or very fair weather out there on our side on some things and then other things I think that the uh the kingdom kingdom\nA has clearly a diligently and horrifically works worked against the United states and our interest so it's it's it's a bizarre relationship I was never comfortable with George W Bush's relationship with the Saudis\nAh the proper relationship it seems to be along the same lines as George W Bush's relationship I just I've never trusted the Saudis but this is a very bizarre gruesome\nAnd difficult very complicated matter in the sense that the Saudis are good\nActing as a check to the out of control terrorists in Iran and the mullahs the Ayatollah Khomeini et cetera uh the Saudis or a very good check\nTo the Iranian power imbalance in the region\nSo I Do have a question for you I Want to get into more of the details here more a little odd and nuggets are coming out about the show the\nBut the question I have for you the Schmidt audience if you're watching us on Newsmax television if you're listening to us on nationwide Schmidt affiliate radio my question to you is\nIf the Saudis were completely involved\nAnd executed this American resident empty I mean he had a green card as a permanent us resident Jamal ... living in the Washington DC area writing for the Washington Post as a columnist\nHis kids are American citizens from everything I've read\nOr what should the Trump Administration do so very clearly if the Saudis killed ...\nWhat should the Trump Administration do\nDo we look the other way and this is complicated because of the Iran factor because of the oil factor and yes the Saudis if they want to get nasty and belligerent\nThey can rock the world oil market no doubt about it they can say even though we're a the the biggest producer of oil right now or last I saw the Saudis and their influence at OPEC they can obviously move the needle which would be painful to us the United states you me\nAt the gas pump the question though is if the Saudis killed his show you folks\nIt's looking like they did this looks like a a Keystone cop a really bad elimination scheme gone really really wrong at a total miscalculation that's what this looks like\nSo you know my bet is is that they try to rub ... they they want the Rob amount and they were successful in robbing them out that the Saudis at the direction of NBS that's a Mohammad bin ... he's the crown prince\nThat his goon squad and we even have names and faces attached to him and his top level of security that flew in ah folks I I don't think trust me it's a much better bet than these losing mega millions tickets that I have right here a much better back to the Saudis\nRubbed out to show me and not even\n[noise] fathom being not even having a clue that it would explode into this international come full of grace in this incident of humongous proportions\nIn which are the world is horrified and what appears to be an official state sanctioned hit a nasty\nWhen you hear the details and we've been talking about this for a couple of days but my question to you is\nFor radio and TV viewers and listeners the question is what should the Trump Administration do if it is absolutely proved that our ally Saudi Arabia\nMurdered assassinated completely rub without a U.S resident not a citizen but a resident alien or a permanent residents of the United states wants the Trump Administration do\nA eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's the nation wide number and as I told you yesterday I told you just a five minutes ago\nThat cause show these kids are American his kids are U. S. citizens\n... how should the Trump Administration I Want you to be ah my palm paleo I Want you to be secretary of state or I Want you to be a Trump Administration advisor ... what would you suggest what would you tell the president what do you want to see President Trump do if it is\nAbsolutely proven that the Saudis murdered his show me\nThe number is eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's how you get in will grab some calls coming up in just a bit so the latest details are that secretary of state Mike Pompeo\nAnd the president they appear to be giving Saudi Arabia well a lot of line of duty they\nGiven Assad is a lot of leeway as this investigation into um the mysteries disappearance of ... as it rolls on now the Turkish are getting frustrated\nThe Turkish they see and that's what I I uh I've got major issues with Oregon and turkey and uh I don't even think they should be a NATO that's a whole different story we've talked about are the problems with turkey as well a fair weather\nA play both sides of the fence a non not supportive of many of the ... of our US interests which are bizarre because they are a NATO\nAlly and there are a member of NATO or but anyway the Turkish they're getting frustrated and they're looking at what they think is at least\nI mean an aura of ambivalence on the part of the Trump Administration\nAre now in all fantasy her where is the proof it's looking like the Saudis did kill ... bought a as Trump said maybe a little too flip and leave with the Associated Press where he told he told the a P A quote here we go again\nWhen you are guilty until proven innocent I don't like that\nI was I I agree with the premise that yeah you're you're innocent until proven guilty\nOr give us the facts give us the details now where we don't know is behind the scenes if the Turkish\nHave already provided us and tell or the White House or Mike Pompeo a whiff of details did they play this alleged audio recording for my palm pale when he was in Turkey after we left Saudi Arabia with the smiling creepy crown prince and the and the the er the king\nMe a break [noise] so the Turkish you're getting a little frustrated here and ah you know they\nClaim to have this audio and video evidence of the murder now where is it are they going to provide and again proof is necessary here uh you got to have the proof I I agree with the president on that so there are very specific details that are coming out\nFrom the alleged audio of this execution and folks the details as we told you we had some of the details yesterday or they're ghastly I mean they are gruesome Graham ghoulish a will for all the gene wars that it I mean it's really some nasty stuff here\nAnd the Turkish are concerned that we the United states are essentially ... the Saudis in a cover up\nOh really is the price starting it only Nineteen Ninety five among visit ... dot com that's oh MA or call an eight six six six or nine nine three seven seven to find out more on the phone your small business deserves\nI used to be voice mails for myself because the only one I could trust to get something done right was may\nYou may remember to order the goggles got some milk on your way\nBut now I use Granger ... got the technical support you'd expect from America's number one source for industrial grade supplies during the business of helping my business so no more talking to myself now I talked to Granger because when it comes to keeping your business running ... got your back color click ranger dot com to see for yourself Granger for the ones who get it done\n[noise]\n\n\nTheir\nShow now continues I saw that's the question I haven't gone through some of the additional gruesome details leaking out allegedly um the murder\nOf cars show get the hands of the Saudis my question is what should Trump do about it how should Trump handle Saudi Arabia if they killed this us a Reza ... not not a citizen\nNow tell me a favor I'm I'm a carry the silver Anthony is in Kansas City Missouri\nAnthony online to Anthony can you bring up too quickly on James [noise] I Anthony you think that the Trump Administration should do nothing is that correct Anthony how are you there [noise]\nHang on a sec I guess we can hear him hold on I mean I I was going to carry him over anyway so I guess we really went back in a minute [noise]\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates days locked but you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial approval only about on certain through your ...

more than sixty percent of cell phone capacity is still out in Bay county the Panama City area followed by Gulf cow to get forty three and a half percent and Franklin liberty counties at twenty two percent of peace\nWith news on the Florida news network I'm Gordon bird\nThe underground command post mark Levin is on twelve fifty W H in the week night seven to ten showing manner\nIs a very complicated situation because as I said that the Saudis acting as a counterbalance in the region to\nThe terrorists governments of the Iran and\nMost of the the Saudis are not smell like Rosie is a rose is most of the\nTime as well but you know it's sort of the the lesser of two evils and again it's it's been a very fascinating read relationship to say the least again with the Saudis and I believe much more knowledge or maybe not at the highest levels of the royal family but certainly with the large royal family\nWithout a doubt a there was more knowledge of nine eleven and the hijackers\nThen we were told that I'm not a conspiratorial as a I just have always been very suspicious of the Saudis now with Jamal ... oh you have the economic issues an oil obviously in Iran and just it's really just a a big giant messier now live show he though you know this individual doesn't\nThe the the the proverbial clean his hands of all I've read numerous pieces about\nHis friendship and high school with Osama bin Laden doesn't mean that he was tied to nine eleven but uh\nAnd you know talk of a a\nMuslim Brotherhood connections of Jamal cause Yogi wasn't even if all that is true and for instance here here's a here's a blurb from front page magazine or in high school Jamal cause show he had a good friend his name was Osama bin Laden\nWe're hoping to establish an Islamic state anywhere 'cause show he reminisced about their time together in the Muslim Brotherhood and\nA lot of folks regarding onto that did well he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and well he deserve to die a lesson I I'm Still concerned it didn't appear the show he was involved in any activity a detrimental to the U.S in his later life or really for that matter\nAnything directly or impactful in a negative nature to the United states are but some are trying to say oh he was a Muslim Brotherhood members so well he deserved\nI don't think we can [laughter]\nI don't think we can jump on on that oh by the way I Am funny ah from Kansas City who I tried to grab just before the break a he was there and apparently he couldn't hear me or something with the phones let me try to bring up Anthony here quickly Anthony in Kansas City Missouri can you hear me now\nWhat's up\nPay very ... like you say that again I Want to prime the pump 'cause all the lines are jam because I've asked the question if it is prove that the Saudis Rob out this could show you guy what should the Trump Administration do and on my screen or hear it says you think we do nothing\nI Would say do absolutely nothing no surprise that keep them married to the dollar deal that you made when he was on air coming in the United states offer\nRight so what if they kill the u._s.\nPresident that's killer\nYou as president that would be a different story that they\nDon't have to retaliate but wait a minute but hold on one wonders what all monitoring well well well\nEvery ... every ... show he was a U.S resident without a head of a ... I said I said resident he 'cause he was getting karma ... show was on\nThe show he was a U.S permanent resident he was not a citizen but his kids always got four kids that apparently all us citizens because they were born here so us resident or you you certainly do nothing even if he was a resident so I Do mean citizen or a resident\nThey said that\nAll right that he learned as collateral damage to the camera and keep our workers work then they got a lot of money left came for coming in to the United states offers\nSome famous ... nothing I saw America fires\nAnd I've got the article over here as well according to the daily mail the Saudi consul\nSo the the Saudi that runs the Saudi consulate the Saudi console can be heard on this audio recording what's that whole story is fascinating as well so it it essentially sounds like it means that the Turkish had the Saudi embassy or consulate bugged\nBut on this audio numerous sources are saying you can you hear on the audio recording the Saudi console saying to the hit squad that was brought in to rub on cars so gay\nThey were cutting off his fingers one by one the Saudi consul said do this as the daily mail\nHe's heard a this is one of the sources has heard the seven minute recording of the show he's dying moments and he said that could show he was dismembered while he was still alive on October second\nTurkish police also continue to operate under the theory\nThat he was brought in the hit squad also was coordinated because they knew he was coming for the uh divorce papers as well as the new marriage license they knew and they sent the squad him\nTo take him out\nTurkey says and he found certain evidence we told you yesterday that his ah that there was some type of toxic material found a new a freshly painted walls was out because there was blood spatter all over the place the allegations that a bones saw was used to take them apart\nNow\nThere is a a a Syria working theory that they might have used asset to the dissolved his body one of the series was they cut them up and pieces and took them out in a diplomatic bags and diplomatic pouches\nSo I I mean yeah the details are nasty on the table one of the killers tells the others to wear headphones and cranked up the music\nWhile they carried out the torture and the dismembered Mitt that's allegedly also part of the story according to the daily mail source cause show these fingers were cut off one by one on a desk in an office\nAt the Saudi conflict and then they trapped his head off [noise] ah is is the story we're getting\nSo I mean just nasty and grizzly and gruesome I earn a gun the president of turkey would love nothing more than a to mess things up obviously between Trump and the Saudis 'cause they've got a nasty relationship that this whole thing is just a complicated freaking mess\n... back to the phones here let me grab by Eric in Jacksonville, Florida Eric you're on Schmidt high\nAt a ... this whole thing it's got thing and despicable and I agree with what Senator Rubio regardless of the arms deal a human being was knocked out in it and not absolutely cannot and I hear that President Trump has proven that families are behind it and I believe they are so does my wife\nHas got dropped the most extreme sanctions come up with and I would definitely like to see a than a navy seals in there to capture lawn and cut off the ground rules my wife would like to see among strapped to his faith that rocket and released into the atmosphere like my owner of the good with\nOne of us [laughter] or go Eric I this is just the ... on so many levels this is just a mess but ... ... just because he wasn't as a citizen he was a resident alien he had permanent residency here in the United states so he\nHad some ties with Muslim Brotherhood and at some point in his life\nI just you know we all ... of course and and listen I I Am a I'm a staunch anti terrorism individual I I I Want to fight these monsters\nTooth and nail to the the highest degree but I just don't know it must have you got a ton of Republican uh congressmen and senators you mentioned Marco Rubio young Lindsey Graham\nAh this just can't be tolerated you can't give a country a pass\nTo just decide that they want to take this guy out because he writes bad things and there's bad blood between himself and the Saudi royal family just can't be done Eric thanks for the call appreciate it let's grab Wendy in West Palm Beach Florida Wendy what should try that thirty five seconds Wendy once Trump do if it's proved\nWhy don't we try getting off the oil and this guy was this guy represented freedom it doesn't hang it can't we get off the oil somehow well done\nWell we're using less Saudi oil obviously we're we're producing more oil and the United states uh then we have a ... maybe ever I thought I saw a report that we're producing more oil than we ever have\nAnd we're the number one producer now so I saw that in the last a month or so uh but what happens is because the whole package world oil trade a OPEC and can obviously controlling swing prices even though we're a large producer and ... it's a supply and demand so they could they could screw around with us but I like the concept\nOf the nation will\nSee is\nFrom the underground command post marks live in is on twelve fifty W H ... weeknight seven to ten [noise]\n\nThe following is

[laughter] on many levels there's no doubt about it with a couple\nKeisha with Iran you've got the oil complication the economic complications of this just a mess here and then we have Jamal could show ... who I brought this up by earlier in the week I brought it up last hour I Want to have more time not to get into a little more depth ear\nAgain the story of Jamal ... show he is not that of\nA lily white and completely clean hands\nNow did he planned terrorists hijackings no or not to the best of our knowledge however\nUh yes his writings are questionable from uh back in the eighties for instance his sympathies are also questionable\nSo it's not like we're dealing with a a choir boy here but it still doesn't add up to we should just stand by while a U.S resident\nLiving just outside of a Washington DC I'm In DC verbs are is dismantled murdered tortured\nBy a Saudi hit squad I mean there is still a certain decency a so you're the good the bad and the ugly on Jamal could show you again I was mentioning front and a front page magazine\nAnd Daniel Greenfield who wrote a of a long piece on the show he and he's specializes in Islamic terrorism and his piece they talk about cause show he ah in high school was friends with Osama bin Laden\nOr they talked about establishing an Islamic state anywhere they could ah they believe that the first one would lead to another et cetera the friendship of Jamal to show he\nEndured and it's even reported that could show even followed Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan to show he credited Adele ... G listed at a one time is one of the world's foremost terrorists finance there's a finance ears by the Treasury Department bring him to Afghanistan to report on the fighting\nThe media calls 'cause Soviet journalists by his writings from the eighties\nIn Afghanistan read as jihad as propaganda titles like Arab mujahideen in Afghanistan or exemplifies the unity of Islamic law\nWhen Osama bin Laden set up al ... and he called cause show you what the details are after Afghanistan Jamal cars so he went to work as a media advisor to former Saudi intel boss prince Turki a bin ...\nAlleged to have links to al ...\nThose allegations came from among others Zacharias was Sally or that the alleged twentieth hijacker\nOr when the other Nineteen hijackers uh\nFor pet a perpetrator the attacks on September eleventh to show you wrote\nThat the Saudis would not give them to American demands for unconditional condemnation and total cooperation Saudis tend to link the ugliness of what happened in New York and Washington with what has happened and continues to happen to ... in Palestine\nAnd his time in the United states comes to understand the effect of its foreign policy and the consequences of that policy he declared again I'm not saying that this guy was an angel\nAnd again some of ah Jamal could show he's writing I find very disturbing and I am one hundred eighty degrees opposed to no doubt about it\nA Muslim cannot be happy with the suffering of others even if the suffering is that of Americans who neglected the suffering of Palestinians for half a century\nThat's the real cause showed me a cynical and manipulative apologist for Islamic terrorism not the missing a the mythical mortar dissident who's disappearance the media spent the worst part of a weak raving about\n... was not a moderate some describe them as the leader of the Saudi Muslim Brotherhood or the Islamic is network admires or anyone goes into a hole and there's a long piece I'll put the front page piece up on the website on Smith show dot com we'll put it on today's Schmidt lifts up\nSo it already is up on that show dot com on today's Schmidt list\nSo I mean there there are a lot of issues what Jamal to show me however\nAre active in any uh terrorism per se or nothing we can really determine I his writings I find disturbing from decades ago a where his sympathies lie or lied or lay a or a past tense where they are lane\nAh because I don't think he's around any longer he's in pieces somewhere a ... it's still to me it doesn't justify a what the Saudis\nDid [noise] and and ... and and\nAgain it's been a very complicated relationship because he's been very critical of the the Saudi monarchy and the Saudi royal family\nAnd uh the the young mock the crown prince Mohammed bin ... mom who apparently ordered his hit I was I Want to move on to some other things here today but like I Want to give you the full picture because a lot of the media is not giving you the background in history of Jamal\nA cause shown gee I\nAm I'm giving you some of the background on him and it's not all lily white however again I Can't condone what the Saudis apparently did an embassy and as human beings and as a civilized nation\nI don't know how we or how Trump can just stand by Trump said listen Trump said if it was proved that the Saudis I took this guy out that it would be very bad and there will be consequences so the president has said that because that's the right thing to say that's the humane thing to believe and\nTo act upon uh let me grab a couple of calls here then let me move on to some other things ah again\nYou have no idea how things are going to take on a life of its own and every line is jammed let's go to a gym in New Jersey Jim you're on Schmidt high\nOn a little while only Schmidt uh yeah this is a freaking mess\nYou know what to me forget the business and it's clearly human rights violations fish and they get them out of the un\nDisassociate yourself with the Saudis get rid of them let them go go do it on and and just you know aren't worried about the early\n... you know the question is if it is prove and that's not what opened up this can of worms today as I said if it's proved on you know here's the good the bad and the ugly on a ...\nOr if it's proved that the Saudis did a torture him or dismantle him this member and what should the Trump Administration do and that's why you know phone calls hanging on for an hour here ...
