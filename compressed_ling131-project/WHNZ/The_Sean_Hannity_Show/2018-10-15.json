fifty W H in the week nights seven to ten [noise]\nPromise to little song here which might be politically incorrect but hold on I guess not in the second verse some news in his broken in the last\nHalf an hour or so here [noise] a CNN is reporting\nThey're claiming that there are two sources\nThat are claiming that and by the way this is a flashing on average now tour was a little while ago I in big red letters a big red fond of the reports are the Saudis are getting ready to it meant\nThat Jamal ... the U.S permanent residents who\nFor the Washington Post at the Saudis are going to admit that he did die in their custody\nWell that means is that the salaries they lied to President Trump and President Trump was on the phone with the Saudi king and all we had nothing to do it there's well then they uh initially like you know what's happened here folks\nIs the Saudis had no idea that this thing was going to explode into this kind of a story the Saudis had no idea that this was going to be an international press conflict ration of\nMy God they killed vis vis a vis a Saudi national or who has permanent us resident status his kids are us citizens\nAnd he was just popping in to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey to get papers for a marriage license to marry his fiance who is waiting outside\nSo here's the story according to what CNN is going to report the death was the result of an interrogation gone bad so they were planning on interrogating him and something happened now let me go\nA couple of other stories and sources that are popping up here\nAnd if you click on\nIf you go to the drudge link that takes you to Jake Tapper as\nA Twitter feed so top of drugs right now in red font reports Saudi to admit killing journalist\nDuring interrogation so again with the Saudis things have gotten so out of hand they had no idea of this thing was going to be this humongous of the story on the world stage and was any journalistic organization worldwide then I can stand for this and they're going to make a big deal at one of their own\nWas taken out by a ... a government by a governmental entity so that's\nGoing to be the claim and I'm sure they're going to try to paint it on one of the interrogation team members that it went too far he got out of hand this wasn't our intent\nBut they realize that they were backed into a corner that they couldn't deny this ... he was denied that I Know I we did nothing I he we didn't kill me didn't they ... this is there's no way of the Saudi king tells is the President Trump for the phone call my pumped pale on the way to Saudi Arabia arm secretary of state\nSo the Saudis realize oh my God what the hell of we've gotten ourselves into\nOh hang on to say oh my Allah or what the hell we've gotten ourselves into so they ... they clearly\nHad to come clean and now if they're going to do is begin to they're going to absolve themselves as a whole and they're probably going to pin it on ah some of the interrogation team members and then they'll probably make that individual individual sacrificial lambs there'll be punished they'll probably be executed\nWhen in fact uh they probably were doing exactly what they were supposed to do\nMake him disappeared like a Roach Motel\nTo show each activity doesn't check out to the the Saudi conflict so that I'm telling you\nThey realized that oh we there's low we we are in deep events we can't carry this charade and ms lie out any further we've got to just come clean [noise] All right so I promise that I Would come back with a little music and of course we're talking about\nEarly yeah actually did say it but I just don't think that that little Biddy in the we'd see potential sliver [laughter] is worth a million dollars when all is with war and wouldn't even qualify for Native American benefits in fact I have I have a a whole list\nYou're a Native American DNA requirements which this is fascinating\nAnd I get to that coming up it's probably going to be our number two and again we have got a lot of ground to cover we've got to talk to some folks are glad their homes destroyed a in the panhandle we've got to deal with the latest

go to try and you have to have an ancestor own that travel\nRole in on the registry right and that's that's some of what I'm going to go over a year or next hour because it's really fascinating on the requirements and you know I've got a lot of information you know regarding Cherokee Nation uh and and ... there was\nTalk about her being part Cherokee and also of Delaware Indian heritage so I Want

results which she fully controlled with this bustamante I wouldn't want independent analysis\nI think there ought to be a secondary and tertiary test just a loss like getting a second opinion but even that\nIf she is at best\nOne thirty second which that's a stretch because the expert says that there's some ... with his expertise he's claiming that there is an American Indian blood DNA going back somewhere between six and ten generations\nAnd if it's ten generations that's where you get that she's only one and one thousandth perceptive actually one and one thousand twenty four percent Native American which is\nAnd I'd probably far outskirts of of the solar system folks I mean that's that's crazy and it was illness and every line is jammed here but the question is I think it's a very good question\n[noise] with that should Trump\nHave to pay the million dollars even if there was a tiny shred or or should the benchmark or the threshold be that she has to be at least recognized as a Native American of that tribe based on the percentage that they require\nNow all tribes are different folks\nI could do the whole damn show others today 'cause there's so much and this story is so fascinating and which made it even more fascinating is why the hell she thinks that this is a good thing when the evidence is so scared that it's a tiny little ... in the way the TPP would even ...\nWhy she thinks that ruling saying that the documentary the five and a half minute long documentary which I didn't even get to that audio yet\n[noise] a couple of things you and then we're going

visiting the Panama City suburb of blame have a hard\nSeen pictures but it's hard to believe when you're\nAbove us in a play and this is a total devastation\nThe president says the federal government is doing everything it can for survivors governor Rick Scott has been accompanying the president and first ladies got says he's not making any appearances in his Senate campaign for the foreseeable future his wife another surrogates will fill in on the campaign trail Scott's rival incumbent Senator Bill Nelson was on the ground in blood town\nHe says we need to remember that small towns away from the coast of also suffered from Michael Calhoun\nJust like all these other small rural counties are really got his or\nOr it could be in the outlying areas a month to month and a half before\nSome of them are getting electricity\nJust a few miles to the east life is getting back to normal in Tallahassee in the aftermath of Michael and they're making room for refugees from farther west\nMany the panhandle residents who lost their homes to hurricane Michael could end up is temporary refugees in Tallahassee mare Andrew Gillum says they're expecting a couple of thousand new residents what's being starts handing out housing vouchers\nThe federal government has offered vouchers to those communities and my guess is is that Tallahassee will become a major repository for folks using their vouchers for housing in our area so we may see some swelling of our population here\nThe city is already assembling a list of housing available for me to eat right\nHurricane refugees Rick like Tallahassee eight Sears and k-mart\nStores are closing across Florida Sears Holdings plans to shut down one hundred and forty two stores nationwide after filing for chapter ...

twelve fifty W H ...\n[noise]\nA million dollars fear factor and charity\nIf you take the test or the judge here and there\n[noise]\nThe question now is does Trump all all is well worn a million bucks or to her favorite charity\nWhat should the threshold me again\nThere are different tribes there weren't even different types of charity tribes you know some there there is a potential tribe which shows that all she needs is some lineage again I ... we don't have all the exact details here of what the claims are\n[noise] before I go back or you don't let me go back to court because this is fascinating a little more on Native American DNA requirements and uh the difference between percentages and are just not a living a requirement to hang on\nWe'll get to that in a second as man this this is to me this fascinates me but what is even more fascinating is why the hell ... with Warren\nDecided to with this scandal miniscule evidence\nDoubled down and make the claim look see I Am a Native American wedding is potentially as little as one and one thousand twenty fourth [laughter]\n[noise] not a sixteenth nowadays not on a corner one one thousand twenty four on the outside if she falls or if the descendants or six to ten generations back\nTen that brings to the to the one in one a\nOne and one thousand twenty fourth between six and ten generations ten being the outset a and six being just one thirty second even at one thirty seconds and qualify as I get to the man for the second because\nDemocrats are scratching their heads saying oh really it's not like she's a quarter or a three sixty ... this is really big and there's a digging deep uh Rebecca is in Fort Myers Florida Rebecca you are on Schmidt welcome to the program\nThank you\nAnd Rebecca your thoughts are should Trump path to pay the million bucks to her favorite Germany\nWell the whole thing is arguing Symantec if he said if you can prove that you are part Indian she's got him she proved that now for the rest of that\nIt's absolutely ridiculous the small amount it couldn't you know no affirmative action yes you have to be a certain percentage to get anything but he asked he said if you can prove that you are at all you know Indian and see any one what is that you said one thousand and twenty four\nI guess it's something that she got him he didn't he get his say you have to qualify for your tribes wherever he said you have to prove that you're Indian she proved ... he's got to pay up to her charity or well wording\nBut Rebecca let me come back at you with this should there have to be an independent verification men\nWould Trump be within his right to say okay so you use this uh this bustamante guy\nCertainly he's got a very impressive resume and and the movie but if you don't mind we'd like to do two additional DNA tests and see how they come back to it's like a second and third opinion if a million bucks is on the line\nDo you think that there ought to be a a ... a control or should there be a at least verification from a different uh testing source\nI don't think there's anything wrong with going out and get him verification if she thinks she's Indian or he's going to stand by it and what did she care how many tests are going to be done and then I was going to come out that she's a snow again that's all she needs that how he worded at\nYou know I mean yeah try to get anything affirmative action and all that she doesn't qualify for any of that that's ridiculous she's probably as much American indian as I Am which is miniscule which is pretty much matter\nDivided by one thousand twenty four\nNo no no no not one thousand twenty four were taken a fraction of one and one thousand twenty four percent which comes out to a desk all of a point to own nine seven six five three to to to want whatever it is so [laughter]\nThat that that would come out to be it looks like Ninety grant\nBut it's a whole lot better than than a million dollars on us I think\nI I think that would be great if you actually pay them off that you know whatever your mouth comes out to be an error you know you could have had a million dollars a year you know your Democrats want a shelter for air quotes ...\nAnd by the way my math is wrong and I never claimed to be a math genius you're my math is wrong and somebody call up and correct me a eight hundred eight

over the weekend that he is a a distant relative of the U.S as I said to show that was like a famous a Middle Eastern arms dealer back in the Nineteen seventies and eighties and it turns out that he is a descendant it's it's a distant relative ...\nBut the Saudis apparently are going to admit that they killed ...\nAnd they get to claim that they set this interrogation team in to interrogate him and that during the interrogation something went awry something went very very wrong\nAnd remember the Saudi admission allegedly is coming after the the king the Saudi king told President Trump in a phone call we had nothing to do with his disappearance of his death\nNothing so now they he lied to Trump\nOr less the claim is going to be well a lot the McCain didn't know or the king is just found out since\nSo they can't get a cold front back and say oh never mind I'm Sorry yeah we kill the big big mistake just they got out of hand it was just said you know it was like a good fellows type interrogation thing that just went ... went bad it just it it took I took a bad turn\nOh my God I'm you know the\nYou know the the reports last week there was some there were some reports that they that they called in a like a forensic a doctor\nWho saw him up a again last week we had a unconfirmed reports that yeah he was murdered inside the the Saudi conflict in Turkey in Istanbul and that they actually caught him up and removed him\nIn pieces and they use the bones saw\nTo take them apart which my dad is at is gross that is disgusting\nSo what are the consequences biggest a President Trump said if they killed Jamal ... he said this on sixty minutes he said this on numerous occasions the last couple of things that if if they killed ... that ah there's going to be a heavy price to pay\nYou know the sun and the Saudis they came out like tough guys the Saudis over the weekend and you know this morning a ... they were rolling out essentially threats\nThat hey if you're pursuing this if you if you claim that we killed because so he uh that we're gonna we're gonna a Jack up oil prices\nSo the Saudis have essentially they they threatened before now what what apparently is this mission which is coming and I can't wait to see how they actually handle this\nUh you know 'cause also President Trump and said that there were road killers potentially get Trump suggested that there might have been rural killers responsible for what ever happened to cause Yogi is Washington Post columnist missing since October second\nYeah as as President Trump left the White House\nOn the way to tour the devastated Florida half panhandle parts are today\nAnd uh he did land obviously earlier today and at Eglin air force base for his uh aerial view which focuses on believe in fact I'm going to try to get a hold of some folks in the panhandle uh later this hour to get an update but President Trump on the way the Florida Panhandle today\nI said that he had spoken to the king and the king firmly denied any knowledge he says he doesn't want to get into king Solomon's mine but says it sounded to me like maybe these could have been role killers\nSo is that they're going to more fed into the the road killers are these Saudi intel interrogators that that killed to show the inside the embassy so it it was an interrogation allegedly gone wrong\nIt was so wrong they had to take them apart on a bone saw\nAnd this member him in and carrying them out in the in recent pieces\nOh All right so I I Wonder what the administration what Trump is going to say uh and how the Saudis are going to admit this how are they how and you know ... when does he has pump pale left yet\nOr you know my pen pals going over so I you\nKnow is I mean I I Believe is he's got to be and I thought the president said he was on the way soon so I Would imagine ... en route to Saudi Arabia\nWanna mess that the Saudis they had no clue that this thing was going to explode like this that this was going to be an international incident mad that they miscalculated is now the question is do they plan on killing them or did something really bad during the interrogation\n[noise] I'm guessing they get a pin it on one of the interrogators and there's going to be a scapegoat in someone's going to take the fall or even if and I\nDon't think it's out of the questions they plan to take them out and make them disappear anyway thinking this would be just under the radar and nobody would know and not an international stories when it comes down to an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred\nAn eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine also I think what's at play here is the Saudis are coming clean because the Turkish must have some audio and video prove as they said last week\nAnd the whole claim and I'm not I don't have an apple watch uh I don't have an iPhone and Android guy bought last week\nYou know I was saying man you know it sounds like that the Saudis have the the conflict bug that they had audio and video a inside the conflict to capture this or that some videos taken and somebody leaked it or they're they have a spot and then someone on the inside\nAnd then it came out oh no he transmitted his death by his apple watch\nAnd then the story came out that that's technically impossible\nThat you might be able to control your cell phone from your apple watch but you can't take video with the watch and then transmit that or would be not to the class so that that doesn't add up from a technological standpoint from what I understand\nI ain't hunger and James who's an apple not my uh and James my a technical engineer a James as an apple watch analyze phone and he says he says I Am correct because apparently his phone his iPhone was left with his fiance outside of the conflict\n[noise] so I\nI and I think I think my first guess last week was wow you know what this means that the Turkish have bugs the Saudi conflict\nAnd and I I don't think they want to admit it but that was my first\nGuess that was my first inkling last week when I talked about this and then the apple watch thing came out and apparently the technologically that whole story is falling apart I wear an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine oh now the wall Street Journal folks breaking news the wall Street Journal is now reporting the same thing is CNN\nSo the wall Street Journal has reporting apparently that\nAre independent reporting aside from CNN Wall Street journal is saying that the Saudis they kill the show he uh and interrogation gone bad inside the constantly wow there's thing is a\nReally you know what this is beyond ugly this is fun ...
