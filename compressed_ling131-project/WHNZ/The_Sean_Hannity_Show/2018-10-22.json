about this and if there's any proof and Trump said you know what you should do John go to the middle of the caravan take your cameras in search\nAgain I I I I Can't sit there and say there's any proof of middle Easterners that have infiltrated certainly it's a possibility but I haven't seen anything to suggest that it's actually happened\nThe the caravan has those that are trying to hit the United states border they are apparently some merrily rejecting what the Mexicans are offering and the reason why\nAllegedly is they don't believe that they're really being offered the asylum\nA per se they believe that the Mexicans are trying to round them up in order to bend the port them back to their home country of Honduras has a ... it's\nWhat we should be able to do to them\nNo less I I'm not I'm not arguing I was on I was telling you what you're saying yeah oh yeah I'm I was telling me what they claim is that the Mexicans have offered these caravan ers asylum but those in the caravan are turning down because they want to come to the United states Linda thanks for the call\nAppreciate it Jacob is a next in Birmingham, Alabama Jacob Iran Schmid welcome to the program\nOh thank you very much appreciate you taking my call I'm going to touch base this on the migrants\nHere and um but it's\nIt's a big problem we have on the border um I Believe that Trump's definitely riot act as murder Syria should call up military and stop them from coming in our borders a lot of gang members they're criminals and also people who are for getting up one of the ideas as well as\nDiseases such as polio is a problem now and now in Africa there is a problem with Ebola in Africa now\nAnd then once I I'm not I'm not going to dispute health issues as as a whole litany of of issues on but the number one thing is we're a sovereign country we have a right to protect our borders and we don't have a free flow\nAs many Democrats want many of the progressive one there's one open their borders just come in everyone just flood our country you know that's the main concern you know the unsubstantiated stories or even President Trump pushing that they're a middle Easterners in here and there could be terrorists than this and I mean I\nPut that aside I've seen no proof of that\nAs far as a a gang members and criminals in the caravan I'm sure there are those with some unsavory records that are in this caravan\nI think the bulk are law abiding individuals that are looking for a better life I think that there are politics attached and there is an organizational effort here I I I think there's some usa shaming that's that's a at play here but the book I think are not criminals\nOr they want to come to the United states which go gosh well guess what you know I I I I'd like a you know a a gulfstream gee six fifty jet but doesn't mean I I'm going to get one right\nOnce they get here though they're going to get the benefits and there'll be area where you were a lot of you sort of have

stories where some some teenage girls are from the U.S said a made connections online and they were headed to join the ISIS harem and then be turned into you know sex slaves or whatever yeah listen I saw the stories but however was if we can't instantaneously\nAnd fully make the leap\nThat there must be middle Easterners in this caravan I just I Am in Seattle being honest here I I just haven't seen any proof to substantiate what the president's claiming on that front and I went this way President Trump from using that\nI fully support the president in we're a sovereign nation we need to protect our borders\nThese other countries need to stop their citizens from trying to rush our country and make up the line well they're Fifteen hundred miles away to the U.S border I fully on board

I mean are we going to get into a new arms raised we have a new Cold War breaking out what was that things have been pretty damn chili anyway\nThey should be a little more chilling because Trump should have been more forceful of putting in Helsinki but that's a whole different story\nSo both of them\nIs in Russia because this is a a a continuation of ... was started in Helsinki at the summit you know a couple of months back\nSo we'll see what happens but we are pulling we made the announcement that were pulling out of this this Nineteen eighty six treaty this I N F treaty\nWhich I think

meeting a conference he was that in Sochi in Russia where the Winter Olympics were held so Russians will will go to heaven as martyrs in the event the nuclear war because Moscow\nWill only ever use nuclear weapons in retaliation that's what ... said this was last week we have no concept of a preemptive strike\nNow that's that's not that's not true they have all the contingencies for all types of strikes including a first strike just as we do as well\nI you know it's not our intention that it would be essentially mad or mutually assured destruction in that uh if somebody did first strike us that while they would be completely obliterated 'cause we have the response capabilities but\nYou know for for ... say we have no concept of a preemptive strike that's just a flat out lie so this was this this a forum\nThat ... was that last week\nAnd it was a question that came in\nFrom the audience he said in such a situation we expect to be struck by nuclear weapons but we will not use them first he said\nThe aggressor will have to understand that retaliation is inevitable that it will be destroyed and that we as victims of aggression as martyrs we'll go to heaven\nThey will simply die because they won't even have time to repent\nOh he's getting all religious others really this is is ah Mr KGB ice in the veins he sees a preacher religious stuff you know really\n\nI don't remember it

I'll tell you right now that law to report and saying that you know they have no concept of a preemptive strike is absolute crap that's crap on a stick crowds crap in a bucket\n[noise] because a Russian war games\nConstantly are\nTackled from the angle of a ... of a of a first strike\nSo he has his own war games\nUh many times include a first strike or a preemptive strike on the enemy and of course those games are absolutely fully going to include us so [noise] ah well we'll see what develops here but certainly things continue to chill between us\nAnd that's not chill and a good sense of some of the the Russians there's no doubt about it\nAt yeah putting also went on to say that yeah that the Soviet republics are those break a ways that they regret the end of the USSR\nAnd we know

an absolute mess and the president\nIs also in this mess or because the president has been he's been darting all over the place\nYou know believing the Saudis not believing the Saudis are finding their description plausible you know I I even tweeted out on one of the inauguration of President Trump's\nAnd listen I I just wish she wouldn't give his his detractors an enemies ammunition here I just don't know why you know just stay quiet\nJust say hey listen there's a full investigation will bring you details or when we know them\nCommentary once the investigation is done but to suggest that their stories plausible and this and I mean I I just don't understand why the president opens himself up to scrutiny sometimes he just needs to shut his whole I'm telling you\nHe just needs to just it just put a cork in it and just stop yeah can\nYou say one conversation sometimes he changed his position three times\nWhich it shouldn't happen that way it's just stupid\nSo you know I I've facetiously I tweeted out over the weekend\nWhen the president had said that the Saudi explanation initially was totally plausible I tweeted out in a dripping Lee sarcastic fashion I agree with at real Donald Trump the Saturday explanation of the show he's accidental death during a fist fight is one hundred percent plausible I\nAlso believe his body than accidentally fell on a boat and saw
