Indian blood going back between six and ten generations in Tempe generation\nThat would've made her a percentage one one thousand twenty fourth one slash one thousand twenty four\nOriginally the Boston Globe had that at one five hundred twelve so they they had a double it they were wrong so then\nThey had at the six generational point the Boston Globe had senator Warren's Indian percentage at one thirty second turns out guess what that\nAlso was wrong and ah\nThey update back to one sixty fourth so listen everywhere you slice it it's just a joke here and I pointed out yesterday a couple of things the CNN website they had a big screaming headlight or a headline\nIn headlights a big screaming headline that a Senator Warren uh shows that she has Indian heritage\nAnd you know you had to get to the story to find out you know with the it was in the small print proverbial job in the proverbial small print that uh it was a six and had it was way remove way down the line and that was\nThat was sort of buried in the CNN story so on TV they were going to get any on their Web site they were all guinea well guess what\nNow we have a Chris Cillizza the CNN editor at large and he does a lighter writing on their website a sill is also appears on a lot of the the CNN programs so he writes a piece\nTwenty four hours later ear all lizards Warren might have actually made things worse with her DNA gambit\nDraw I haven't really uh you think\nI mean I we pointed this out immediately and many\nWhich are intellectually honest you know in my line of work on there is on the conservative commentary side and it wasn't just that actually some mainstream media also pooh poohed this that wow she's making a big deal out of this you know the the video\nThe five minute ... I think thirty seven second video that this campaign style little law many or a bio pic little documentary that she put out it was deceptive you know one of the terms that the my my wife loves to use she's an attorney she was a prosecutor for a bit until we had\nKids and my wife always ah even with me or the kids if you don't give them the whole story\nOr my wife loves to use the terminology this seat by own mission\nAnd you know I'll chew it up and I'll play an after the break I'll play the audio but it was totally deceitful in Elizabeth Warren video when she has the DNA specialist is Dr

to speak\nLike it's some kind of TV reality show the big reveal the clip she's on the phone sitting down at a table in her house and he's in his office oh and I and he says that Oh yes you do have a Indian ancestry what they did point out was the fact that it could be back as far as ten\nGenerations\nMaking a tiny little Biddy fraction they eliminated that you know I Want to chew that up here and just a second 'cause I I think it's very important\nFor you to hear that to solidify the point I'm trying to make fun again we were all over this yesterday was she thinking she is she should've just stayed quiet she's made matters worse Democrats are saying well why the hell did you do this this close to the midterms and guess what this was not a slam dunk\nThis is not even a base hit this is not even getting hit by a pitch\nThis I mean this was awful\nAnd is a total backfire an\nAbsolute complete backfire in fact earlier today CNN headline that all lives with Warren a DNA than they did it

practice has been released this interview was going to run on Fox Business tonight at eight PM and they've released this clip\nTurkey's looking at him very strongly we're all looking at it together but turkey and Saudi Arabia looking at a very strong land this offends whether or not they came with the crown prince\nKnew about it in my opinion [noise] number one what happens like whether or not they knew about it if they knew about it that would be bad\nYes I Would concur [laughter] a little bit of an understatement that if they knew about it that would be bad\nWell folks were talking about it a an autocracy we're talking about this mole tight knit family they nobody sneezes nobody does the number one or number two without them knowing about it they've got a ironclad grip\nOf course they knew about it it's strange any reasonable aspect\nOf anything to suggest that they had no clue that this was an operation they had no idea but come on\nIt it ... strains credulity beat to the tenth power to uh to to chat ten generations back we're a little bit more in the city makes no sense anyway or a guy on the Turkish leader\nIs dropping some hints here and for those that have gone to a full grasp\nOf the story just a quick little recap here about two weeks ago Jamal 'cause show ...\nA freelance writer columnist or did writing for the Washington Post a historically at odds very critical of the Saudi kingdom or the crown prince the king very critical they don't like that\nAnd when you're that type of a government that type of an autocracy or you you have\nThe ability to do whatever the hell you want without checks and balances and that's what they did here obviously but they've gotten caught which is a big problem so Jamal could show he walks into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nAnd that was about two weeks ago is October second if I'm not mistaken and he hasn't been seen or heard of since\n[noise] why do you go to the embassy well he went into the embassy because he's getting married to his new fiance but apparently he needed new paperwork and documentation he needed Saudi Government approval to divorce\nIs dropping sinister hints about what may have taken place well pump pale was meeting with the Saturday leaders are gone dropped a bombshell Oregon suggested the presence of toxic substances\nAnd freshly painted walls inside of the council he told reporters my hope is that we can reach conclusions that will give us a reasonable opinion\nAs soon as possible because the investigation is looking into many things such as toxic materials and those materials being removed by painting them over\nSo yeah I Try to cover up the scene of the crime I mean\nJust as dirty nasty dastardly is against folks ugly and on top of that a Turkish government officials confirmed that 'cause I can show his body was cut up into pieces [noise]\nAnd then probably carried out in these diplomatic bags are wrapped in plastic sold the blood wasn't ripping from ... ah wow\nI\nAnd oh by the way ... governments are not all you have a lot of X ray the bags on the way out you know the Turkish investigators acknowledged that searching the conflict Thirteen Days after his jokey vanished wasn't the best uh ideally ... hours before they enter the consulate\nNews crews even filled a cleaning crew bringing in boxes of cleaning material I mean that's pretty don't feed it to enable people to see that\nWell what a what a stupid Keystone cop operation just dopey hey folks are speaking adobe\nOr you're paying too much infringed on your credit card debt lesson lots of

B.\nS. and I think he's on a and a bad track I can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us for it and what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia is longest this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them but I'm not going to I've been their biggest\nSelling Lindsey Graham is try to power play this that that they have to if it turns out that MBBS Muhammad been sold month this cocky princes crown prince\nMost likely he ordered the hit but did his father did the king no that's the big question here\nAnd Lindsey Graham is essentially power playing saying that the Trump had better do something that this administration better do something if it turns out that\nThey were responsible and they knew as you know they're trying to pass it lowered down the chain that they didn't know that this was an operation they weren't aware of which one of the initials for Mohammed bin Salman NBS yeah take them away it's just BS\nBecause of course they know everything and then one of the sound bite and then we'll move on to horse face this is Marco Rubio junior senator Florida on with CNN and Alison ... this morning talking about\nA human rights and well the audio bite is very self explanatory on the show you\nMurder is one journalist gruesome murder enough to blow that up [noise]\nFar I can tell you the human rights is worth worrying that up and learn someone into a conflict where there are there by murdered dismembered and disposed of as a big deal\nAnd by the way this happens to be a green card holder the United states and uh who who have been a journalist but he could have been you know a maintenance worker and at the Washington Post it wasn't a matter as a human being whose life was taken by an indirect act of a foreign government by lowering them into a diplomatic facility and a third country\nI mean any one of those factors as bad put them all together and it's catastrophic\nAnd as far as arms sales are concerned it's not the money you know there are other countries we can solve that too important and it's just not the money in the arms sales does give us leverage over our country when they have our weapons systems they need our our maintenance they need our voice ... and the like and it gives us leverage over their behavior you know that's why we're talking about arms sales now because it's leverage\nBut don't buy those weapons from someone else but I don't know I don't care how much money and is there isn't enough money in the world to purchase back our credibility on human rights and I and the the way nations to conduct themselves right\nSo you've got Lindsey Graham\nIs been a very close ally of the president especially of late with capital a Marco Rubio sea of two Republicans here are speaking out\nAnd if the Trump Administration doesn't do anything if it's proved that the Saudis weren't responsible and this was all just a horrific stupid plot gone bad or discovered\nA does is put a whole bunch of Republican senators are Democrats or automatic but listen I mean both what's right is right and if the Saudis did this I mean there has to be consequences\nAnd you can't just say oh I'm a I'm a a a mega hat wearing Trump supporting a love Trump everything Trump all Trump all the time you can't if the Trump the if the prophecy goes easy here I mean that's just it's the wrong thing to do from a humanitarian from what's right\nFrom a moral standpoint I there's got to be a ton of bricks coming down on the Saudis and there's got to be punishment and the president has alluded to that it'll be very very bad again this interview that's coming up on Fox Business tonight alludes to that and I'm confident in this case the president\nIt'll do the right thing now horse face\nAnybody want to comment anybody okay with the president calling Stormy Daniels horse face\nThat was a very important question ... this could be the most important question of the day you the Schmidt listener so Trump had a victory\nPresident Trump tweets up this morning in Lebanon for am eastern time federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees\nAt Fox News great now I can go after a horse face and her third rate lawyer and the great state of Texas she will confirmed the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total ... on\nMy question for you the listener nationwide is\nOn the president can tweet about the federal judge throwing out the suit the ... the the president can gloat about that if he wants but should the president of the United states call this woman\nHorse face is that fair game as Trump can say whatever he wants and he's shown that to be the case and that's what's made many aspects of is a political rising a successful but\nAre there limits or is there decorum\nShould Trump have called the porn star Stormy Daniels for space\nAnd ... and the number to call eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine I Love to hear from you on this horse race appropriate or not [noise]\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is the nationwide number\nSo just a quick little recap here a federal district court judge in California yesterday ruled to dismiss the Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit against the president and also ordered that Stormy Daniels pay his legal fees for the defense of the case up until now\nNow she filed suit against Trump in response to his tweet which called into question her claim about a man threatening her in a parking lot member that April Eighteenth\nA sketch years later about a nonexistent man a total con job playing the fake news media for fools but they know what that was the Trump tweet\nThen of course Trump tweeted this morning the whole horse face deal a few minutes later Michael ... tweeted his response to Trump's tweet\nCold you are a disgusting massage units and an embarrassment to the United states bring everything you have because we're going to demonstrate to the world what a complete shy stir and liar you are\nHow many other women did you cheat on your wife with wild you had a baby at home\nOh man that nasty\nAnd then Stormy Daniels tweets out and well\nThe presidential pain is back in the equation here folks\nYou know after Stormy Daniels gave the interview and the describe the president's agenda tell you which that fueled CNN for like two and a half days\nStormy Daniels tweets out\nToday ladies and gentlemen may I present your presidents\nIn addition to his alma shortcomings he has demonstrated his incompetence hatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter again and perhaps a penchant for bestiality\nGame on tiny\n... [noise]\nSo I essentially calling the president's private parts time we got hoarse face we've got tiny we have shortcomings I mean folks [noise] welcome to politics twenty eight team\nIPhones are loaded here will go to your calls in a second eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you're on hold hang on you want to try to get

is uh most of the the president obviously has a right to a voice his opinion about Stormy Daniels the lawsuits are ... it's just a pain in the ass a bunch of Trump called her horse face in a tweet from the president the United states\nHas to do whatever you want it now that lady lied about him ... tons of money take on decline hurting his family I mean I it's harder hurting me got mild compared to what I Would want to call\nIt a minute you said that she lied about him what exactly did she lie about\n... anything that do not have quite today well uh yeah\nWell well she she brought about a
