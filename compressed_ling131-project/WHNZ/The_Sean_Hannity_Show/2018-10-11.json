is you know the communications are still down um you know and if they somehow did survive and we obviously hope that they did ah you know you deal with this ... you deal with the mental um\nAfter effects of it because let me tell you something if you survive a hundred and fifty five now in our hurricane\nOr you're thinking about her for a long time and it's just not only are you trying to survive physically but you're trying to survive the experience mentally and I can tell you anyone that's trying to write out a hundred and fifty five mile an hour storm is something that will never forget it for the rest of their lives\nOne image and I'll let you go to second in one image is made the biggest impact on you or that you saw role in from the various uh feeds that you see\nWell you can just see it's it's again it's how how how far inland more water goes um you know I've covered hurricanes are covered if you go uh in in Myrtle Beach South Carolina\nAnd and I think I'll tell you the story before you arrive and when the hurricane is ongoing you're just amazed at the water can make it in places that you never think of water is going to make it and I think that's the case with\nWith many hurricanes that make landfall the water really ends up in places that normally you would say it's too far away it can't make it here and it does\nAnd you're stuck I mean ... we just kept on going backwards and we just kept on going inland about when you're in a in a home or a house in the wind's blowing the hundred and thirty miles an hour you just can't get out and walk down the street you're kinda stuck\nAlthough ... chief meteorologist at Fox Thirteen and Tampa Bay with decades of hurricane experience Paul thanks a lot and I hope we're hope we're done with these conversations yeah\nAll right for the season Paul thank you Bye bye so pulled only got a Fox in Tampa you know full disclosure long time a personal friend of mine as well as a great a TV personality as well as a certified meteorologist AMA and all you know all the the seals and and everything\nAnd you know he's has a lot of experience you know when you see some of the details here and yeah you hear from people along the Florida coast like Mexico beach and you know people that have been able to look in the description is it looks like an atomic bomb went off\nI mean that really does say at all and as you know uh what's already creeping into the conversation is look\nLook what climate change has done\nAnd listen folks I'm not denying that the climate changes or the climate is always changing it's been hot or it's been colder I mean the planet has been hot or I mean you can look at the medieval warming period we could you know geology is no we know that the planet has been warmer the plan has been cooler\nYou know you've got a sunspot cycles you've got solar cycles obviously I mean there are a lot of factors now with a\nAnthropogenic or manmade activity I can apply to be here I mean I'm sure the planet does take on additionally but I you know all these stores here and there was a story last week\nJust last week there was a story that we've got the UN or with a new report out we've got Thirteen Years to stop the the climate warming or else we're doomed Thirteen Years what were they saying my early twenties thirties\n[noise] we're going to be totally doomed\nWell didn't we hear this same scenario I mean Al Gore's movie won an inconvenient truth\nWe adjust years the acting and that was a\nIt was almost one almost two decades ago that was two thousand three two thousand say whatever the inconvenient truth a movie came out from algal but we we've heard this before and I'm not a scientist I Know that there are some scientists that do subscribe not many do but\nYou know here we are we've got a hurricane activity which has always existed\nAnd now it's oh my God look what man made climate change is doing look at the the horrific effects\nOf hurricane Michael you know you look at some of the stats and this is where it doesn't quite jibe as far as it's manmade or anthropogenic it's global warming and climate change you know members global warming that it became climate change that we've talked about the politics of even the verbiage usage\nBut you know you look at some of the stats here\nAs you look at the cable news coverage and some of these experts and getting on and they're talking about oh yeah if if you don't believe in climate change now well ...\n... you're a lost cause but then you know then you look at\nThe stats and the same cable channels that are putting up a these experts that are saying oh this is clearly climate change that brought about the massive destruction and the the intensification of hurricane Michael but then they put up you know graphics\nThat show that well Michael is only the strongest\nUh as far as windows\nIn fourth place so it's only the fourth strongest as far as wind and then as far as a ban metric pressure Michael is in third place so the point is\nThe strongest when recorded was the Labor Day Nineteen thirty five hurricane before they even use names so Nineteen thirty five Labor Day strong a storm a is number one in the wind speed at one hundred eighty five mile per hour clocked wins\nThat was Labor Day Nineteen thirty five nights\nA Camille Nineteen sixty nine\nHundred and Seventy five mile in our wins you an Andrew under which which at homestead Florida Ninety two and Nineteen Ninety two hundred and sixty five mile an hour winds and then we have Michael in fourth place a just\nA yesterday with a hundred and fifty five miles per hour winds but then you look at the lowest barometric pressure is Labor Day Nineteen thirty five is still the lowest barometric pressure recorded Nineteen thirty five\nAnd eight hundred Ninety to ... and Camille in sixty nine was nine ordered Michaels in third place at nine hundred Nineteen little bar so it just shows that we've had storms from long ago and also the Eighteen fifty one storm\nI Believe was mentioned as a real devastating blow to the panhandle certainly not very populated back then but it shows these hurricanes they ebb and flow intensities I'll get into a little bit more later on but again\nThis settled science arguments all its it's manmade climate change its it's global warming but then you look at stronger storms that was stronger back in the late sixties and in Nineteen thirty five in the midst of the great depression [noise]\nAll right let me go to Brant a brand the is now in Tennessee and I

he sat in the oval office today aside from the believable words like BS and mother ... [laughter]\nYes [laughter] I I mean he did have some valid things to say but it was absolutely topsy turvy and I've got some of the topsy turvy audio to play for you in just a second you know I'm [noise] the thing that I Would\nNote is that I think the Kanye West situation with a visit to the white I probably could have had greater effect if it weren't this close to the aftermath of Michael\nI like President Trump going to Erie, Pennsylvania last night for a rally and we told you all about this we told you that the president was going to get a ration of you know what a for a media outlets\nAnd of course it happened on on the cable lose a fair last night on some of the channels\nAnd I had a well like you know October is now out my shell maybe that the reason that he was talking about is bipolar and up but they've been friends for a long long\nYeah well also but he he's saying that he really doesn't have bipolar disorder that he was he\nWas misdiagnosed with it oh\nOkay well I I didn't hear that part by radio and uh so no problem but uh you know they've been friends for a long time and and really a lot of people don't know that Trump is friends with a whole bunch of the party and every every walk of life all different races creed how does that mean you name it\nWell I you know again I'm I'm just I'm pretty ... I don't have a spring list I don't know everyone that the president's friends when I just think that the the ... meeting probably could have been a little more effective if it were not the day after this massive a natural disaster in Florida so that that's what I was suggesting\nYeah and he he's got a president and that's one thing and he got out thousands of people waiting for I'm In Pennsylvania and I think they're going to criticize him no matter what each\nOther there's no doubt about it and see now and and this this is where I I think that I I represent and I I think that my analysis is you should really fair because I'll tell you what he's right I'll tell you when he was wrong\nAnd I probably want to push the rally off and I think the bulk of the folks I was doing a couple of days later just you know in the middle of the natural disaster ... just gives the critics an opportunity to uh to to bear down obviously Mary thanks for the call I appreciate it\nA more ... coming up momentarily sponsor this hour therapy works relief off your loved one if you get a leg or a foot cramps you know how painful and disruptive they can be muscle cramps can joke you want to sound sleep interrupt your daily life listen carefully because I recently learned about therapy works relieve\nA non greasy form it's proven rules or to relieve muscle cramps fast and reduce muscle ... plus with daily Hughes Sarah works relief can even prevent muscle cramps before they start\nAnd you can get a full night's sleep through the activities that you love without worry Sara marks relieve only takes a couple of minutes to apply absorbed as quickly and it works people loved the results you might have even seen doctor drew Pinsky on TV talking about their works relief you got the holiday around the corner if you know someone who suffers with muscle cramps or muscle ... has\nThis is an awesome gift or just give them the gift of telling them about Sarah works really great choice for preventing and relieving muscle cramps making yours to get federal works relief today and the pain relief file and Walmart CBS Rite Aid and Walgreens or even talk to your local pharmacist learn more\nAnd thorough works relief dot com T.

that going to play golf after Daniel heroin me had it and after James Foley was they had it and then he went and got the\nAfter four Americans are slaughtered so that was not good\nWell listen I I Know that when an event happens with Trump we can go back and look at you know there's been any previous criticism and\n... there's the the tit for tat back and forth it's it's going to go on there'll be comparisons it always happens regardless of who the president was or use whether it was Obama and comparing him to Bush or Clinton or whomever\nSo if it's always going to happen you know one of the things that has has given the Trump critics a little bit of animal here feel is\nIs that back in November of twenty twelve Trump actually tweeted out or his displeasure\nBecause uh he tweeted that yesterday Obama campaign was Jay Z and ... and sprinkled steam while Hurricane Sandy victims across New York and New Jersey are still decimated by Sandy wrong\nOr exclamation point so you know Trump even he tried to tag Obama for campaigning with Bruce Springsteen and rapper Jay Z or in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and of course super ... storm Sandy which I did a lot of damage in New York and New Jersey\nYes so\nYou can see it go it goes both ways so with with Trump going to the rally\nYou can understand that his critics really criticize him when in fact he did something similar by criticizing Obama\nYes I say [noise] okay fine thank you very much\nWell thank you very much for the call I appreciate Brian is next Brian is in a beautiful Tampa Bay Florida Brian you're on Schmidt

last couple of days you know I had a lot of a hurricane\nMichael tweets and some thoughts that I conveyed and I think some of the hashtags are were seen by people all over the place and I picked up a lot of followers are looking to move back and so my tweets your quickly\nUh you know why\nI tweeted this out last night and it seems to have gotten a good deal of play I tweeted out\nHurricane Michael first responders county and city workers will do heroic work so it's not just you know your firefighters you EMTs your police officers but it's also going to be your county and city workers that are going to clear roads\nIn order for first responders to get through I mean it's just so many levels of people that are going to help so I pointed out they're going to do heroic work and also power company Lyman\nFrom utilities all over the country are staging and preparing to restore electric infrastructure through mutual aid agreements and they do amazing work\nAnd the point there is is that most of the power companies around the country they have what's called mutual aid agreements where or when power company a has a problem for instance a hurricane or power companies from all over the country will send cruise in their bucket trucks\nAnd linemen and line women to come down and fix\nThe snap polls the the transformers and these agreements are all over the country\nAnd it's really just phenomenal and I witnessed in the past I've seen some of the staging areas where trucks are lined up sometimes dozens or hundreds of trucks from utilities from all over the country that are there to help\nUh I've seen convoys of utility trucks also making their way and it's not just utility trucks you know the electrical ah workers you'll also see the free service companies or the big companies like when I I Am\nSpoon or they're big and there are a couple of other ones I've seen convoys of trucks also headed to areas to assist so there's going to be remarkable effort in the Florida Panhandle to get these areas back up and running\nA it'll take years for some places Mexico Pete beach the devastation there is just unbelievable and and totally complete devastation\nIn a good

just read you if precipitated a snip listener and I I re tweeted\nThis listener and\nThis listener I'm BJ oaks sent me a tweet ... early this morning responding to mind about the electrical workers and VJ oaks responded to me yes after Irma I cheered up every time I saw a bucket truck\nWe forget how lucky we are to have electricity\nPeriod heroes period\nSo you know these electrical workers folks these ... men and women that get in those buckets get on top of those polls and wires are they are truly in many cases unsung heroes\nOn that\nAh this was last night and I didn't watch it but this is just a little recap some of the audio here\nAnd this is kinda rough actually you know you had a CNN panel on with a Don Lemon last night\nAnd they were marking\nThe upcoming Kanye West Trump meeting which as you know happened earlier today but they were already marking it\nLast night uh one of the bites here they don't want to play this is from a Don Lemon show on CNN last night this is a book Corey sellers or South Carolina democratic a gubernatorial can order a\nLieutenant governor or something he he's a South Carolina Democrat and those in South Carolina you'll you'll you know more about him than I Do but but Cory sellers last night on Kanye West\nVirginia was what happens when you is what happens when negroes don't read 'em and then we have while\nKanye West is what happens when he said that\nIs now now Donald Trump is going to use it in providing some hunting weapons what happens when ... says what happens when they grow don't read 'em and then we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and say pitchers\nAre currently cells also he was in the U.S opera house of representatives for a while out of South Carolina a and then a ... who I Know and I converse with her uh on on ... and she she's not a big Trump fan but she's a conservative or she's a Republican or she had this to say about ...\nUm ... this is not and what's funny to me to watch all of these white people behind Donald Trump clapping away at the name of Kanye West when he was the last that long ago that Kanye West said that George W. Bush doesn't like black people as a carrier Hurricane Katrina\nYeah and you know ... so the ... but now that that in ... because he put on a ... hats\nAnd he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he's he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he's clearly has issues he's already been hospitalized\nYou know I tend to like mental health issues but I mean obviously cognac has taken a turn in a very strange way you read any of his interviews you can go back and re read his interview with Sharmeen that God it's all over the place so this is not exactly the best representation to bakari points especially\nSo hold a terrorist ... hold on I'm a Trump's token you earned it ah any thoughts their folks uh eight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine\n[noise]\nFrom the underground command post Marc ... is on twelve fifty WHM ... weeknight seven to ten [noise]\n\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nIt's called ... and here's how it works with the rate shield you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nYou're more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has re Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing ratio\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin rock and what you said in comparison to get a record ritual approval only balance or eight thirty or just turned ... information conditions equal housing winter licensing office he said and I'm watching for thirty thirty additional conditions or loses may apply\nAnd you know ... so the ... but now all of a sudden ... because he put on a ... hats\nAnd he's an attention war like the president he's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration so go ahead explain\n[noise] okay so there's a couple of things here\nUm I I've been a conservative my entire adult life I worked in conservative politics since I was Eighteen years old so I'm not on to disparage people of color decided they no longer want to be Democrats ... I'm not a Democrat I don't agree with the Democrat world view especially when it comes to issues in the black community\nHowever where I Do draw the line is with people who are now praising Kanye West as some kind of in white savior because he put on America\nHad when he can't really even cogent we put together\nThe reasons why it's more about\nDonald Trump that it isn't necessarily about conservative principles are Republican principles at this point and so people are claiming I've been off the accused that I you know I I just ... because he left the Democratic plantation and all kinds of crazy thing no that's not my issue with having my issue with him is that this\nGuy is clearly not stable\nAnd he's being exploited not by by Donald Trump and his and his supporters because he knows that he's not stable it's ... there's questions about Connie emotional stability for years now and it's kind of come to a head in the last year or so so he goes on these rats\nAnd he's been doing that\nNot making sense and then saying things about slavery is a choice and he did a rambling interview with Charlene the God who\nIs a well known a morning show ... nationally or listen\nTo I I Do the W all our morning show for three years or right down the hall from Charlotte and so you know I Know Charlotte I mean we had him on the show on several occasions so yeah\nHe's yeah he's a well known 'em you know I'm a black warning show host he did a hundred minutes interview with\nKanye over the summer it was a rambling met from ... and so he said things like there were only eight hundred slaves in the Eighteen hundreds like he's he just ignorant about a lot of historical things like take issue with now a lot of these Trump supporters\nWho or disparaging Kanye not long ago because of the comments he made about George W. Bush not caring about black people on up and then ... music he uses the N. word and all kinds of stuff in his music that he was no good then\nBut now all of a sudden he's embraced and I just think that it's ridiculous and he is being treated as a token so that Donald Trump and say oh look I have\nThis guy this last guy who is supposed to be very popular in the black community which he's not as popular as it used to be because of these rats that he's been going on in the strengthening thanks um and so we can point to him\nSo so in that canyon lean in and get willfully participating in it\nI said you're saying it's sort of tamp them out to the white guy that says hey you know I've got a black friend is that what you're saying\nOkay a thousand percent I mean the president went on Fox and friends this morning and basically said he just wide and said that his popularity in the black community went up twenty five percent one tiny endorsed that that's\nNot true and that's not even measure of off and this is the guy that was on Saturday Night live a couple of weeks ago dressed in a Perrier outfit on anything come on\n... on I ... let me ask you as a conservative your entire adult life or a black female or working in geopolitics uh and you've been outspoken against a many policies of Trump for his behavior or it'll what we've seen\nHas has proper the White House have they ever reached out to you have they ever they ever try to have a conversation with you and what's your issue what your problem we try to bring you into the fold or have they ever tried to have a conversation\nNo but I Do know um I you know folks in the White House I mean like I said I I've been in Republican politics or twenty five years liberal arts in twenty or I you know a lot of people on the White House had friends that work there but they know that they're the way that this White House ... through the functional\nIt there is no room for any difference of opinion it's all about blind loyalty I mean my very good French or Michael single and moved to a young black Republicans art as a whip you went over to a hut with a with Ben Carson who needed that needed to help lead me\nAnd um they removed him from his position because they went back and discovers wrote a critical article about Donald Trump during the during the campaign\nThey literally escorted him out with the security because of that despite the fact that he was confident smart and deserved his position [laughter] this is not a this is not an administration that welcomes any kind of difference of opinion or even confidence necessarily and in in in there who they choose for a certain position [noise]\nTo let me just say one other thing that I thought that the attacks that I've been worth\nEating are people feeling uncomfortable the word negro on\nI said a tongue in cheek to make a strong point about kind of the hypocrisy of people in the way that they're treating ... versus other um in in the past I mean no one was upset with Rush Limbaugh when he for eight years\nThis respectfully if this is respectfully in my opinion you supply of parity called rock the Magic Negro\nAnd that was unacceptable now we're talking about the president the United states I wasn't a ... than I didn't vote for him I was against the policy that's what he did an awful thing for this country but you don't disrespect I don't care what the parity or not he called ... it was called for Iraq\nThe Magic Negro where all these people who are attacking me for making the point I made about ...\nAnything like that um when with with that I think that that it's ... also the word negro in the black community is not like the N word it's different you have still have United negro college on the national council of negro women right it is a colloquial term that's used in the black community a\nLittle bit differently not like the N word I I don't justify that but so everyone needs to really does take a step back and think about the point that I was making and and look at the way the economy the haves and hypocrisy and look at what he did today in the oval office\nThat was so disrespectful so demeaning and and and it's just not what the Oval Office she'd be I remember when Republicans freaked out when Brock Obama invited coming\nTo the White House who's actually an old guy may disagree with some of his rap lyrics yup but he's a very talented intellectual actually does you could work and his community and Republicans were excoriated the president for that but they're okay with this clown Kanye West\nClowning himself and disrespect ... this way and the president inviting him to do it\nSo you subscribe to the fault the Kanye West is only in it for Kanye West\nA hundred percent you know\nAnd I don't think he can help it I mean we're not looking at any one is looking at this guy he clearly needs help and I was not by any means mocking people with mental illness either that somehow that got thrown out there which is not the case at all I was simply pointing out immaterial fact\nThat he had been hospitalized for emotional issues and that he's he claimed he was diagnosed bipolar but then he himself today dismissed that in fact you know he he didn't\nEven own diagnosis and talk to them jumbled mess about that so but this has nothing to do with that he's not actively seeking help to ... you know to get that are like a lot of people who do struggle with this issue and they shouldn't be elevated exploited if they're having an episode I just don't think that that's healthy\nTerrorists up Meyer a former GOP communications director or does a commentary on CNN and not you still doing ABC is well correct\nI I don't have any impact at all on us tariffs though I gotta get while I'm\n... will have me on anytime you want and let me ask you one as a black female and a conservative\nAh when I hear the argument really 'cause I I despise the N. word and when I hear black people try to justify that no black people when they use the N word it ends in an a a versus when white people use it it ends in ... or earlier and it's different your thoughts\n[noise] so I agree with you I mean that that term is so violent and let's associated with that\nTerm is beyond the pale and I agree there is a complete double standard when it comes\nTo that and then you can and then when white people turn around and use the term thinking it's\nA term of German it's a little confusing so no I don't subscribe to that the issue with the negro were and the reason why I say it doesn't quite have\nThat same thing yes it's associated with Jim Crow and were negative connotations with the turf ie grow but there's also a like I said a historic um value to that word that\nDifferent than the N. word that still use\nLike I said with organization stay in the black community like United negro college on like the national council of negro women you had any organization just like you have the national those natural those that but of\nColored people journals you know so\nThere there is a difference there that and I think that distinction is important when we're having this conversation if you want to talk about outrage\nWell terror certainly interesting day or I'm not a fan of ah the media covering all kinds of profanity\nAnd the oval office today I either it's well below I don't care who the ... the weather was Obama whether it's Trump George W. Bush or it shouldn't have happened but also we had a we had a Democratic president the totally disgrace the office by um\nBut he said and I'm watching for thirty thirty additional conditions or was it may apply many things scaring me kid\nVampires where ... children\nNot one bit but you know it does scare me downtime inefficiency scares the living daylights out of me that's why use Granger are America's number one source for industrial supplies\nPlus they've got the inventory management solutions that keep us running so we've got up time we've got a fish and see we got productivity when it comes to keeping your facility running ... got your back\nColor click ranger decamp to see for yourself Granger for the ones who get it done\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nTo do you\nWant to play this gentleman we take pride in presenting\nLet me start if we need to be carried over we will melody is in Sarasota, Florida melody do we look at you you there\nYeah hello Melanie what's sort of I Need to carry over I Will your thoughts on Tonya in\nYou know I if I was in front of the president right now talking to him I Would probably be all over the place to give an ADHD\nAnd how I look at Conway he looks like he would be ADHD he says all over the place he's like a little rabbit like oh look at what if I look at look at this look at that you asked my personal opinion okay\nAnd I think a lot of people are just going to bust him on that yeah maybe he's not popular anymore maybe he's making a life change that his decision when he wants to do\nAll right so are you I guess can identify because your personality similar hey so tell me all the calls to hang on we'll get back to them next and an update on a hurricane coming on hang on [noise]\nMine number ... does not look like a number two I don't know what to call it is there a number three [noise]\nPeople for for police\nAnything close to the restroom\nMiddle seat with the stomach problems\nMight be flying [noise]\nSound like you if it does you could be one of the many people with the digestive condition called ... efficiency or a pie I even if you don't know when he ... he is you might know the symptoms frequent diarrhea gas\nBloating stomach pain if you have even just one of these symptoms you could still have the piano because not everybody experiences he'd pee on the same way which is why it's so important to open up to your doctor about oh your symptoms and the good news is\n... manageable so don't keep a lid on it good why Denis ...
