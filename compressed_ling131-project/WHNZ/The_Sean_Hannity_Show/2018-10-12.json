throw their hands on the table to say hey I have ... we had your conflict bugs ... we had an audio and video listening in monitoring equipment inside your conflict\nI mean what how else how else what the the the Turkish have audio and video from inside\nUnless somebody had a a camera phone or ... or ... or ... it\nOr somebody had you know some kind of video and then they leaked it out to the
