district of Columbia to Florida to California and as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division and our world renowned experts at the FBI lab\nIn Quantico but but and I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today

Van Jones Van Jones from CNN was pictured on the side of this guy's van with a cross hair\nA rifle scopes cross hair over Van Jones also looked like it might have been Kathleen the building is as well and uh I mean there are a number of people on there or you know from yes to time and also there was a big CNN logo and it said CNN sucks\nI mean this this this was a a ruling attention getter and in fact\nUh someone sent me some images of the van rolling down the road at an earlier time social this van was already recognized and photographs by motorists and I have a picture of a wasn't today I have a picture of the van in traffic that someone talk\nFrom I don't know whether it was days ago weeks ago a month ago I don't know\nBut people were aware of this\nThis van and this guy so I yeah I

or\nA improvised explosive devices and you know he was very clear that you have these courts have blown up he he said that these were not hoped devices\nI like to know why none of them blew up the components appear to be there you know how significant a blast would have been I think that's to be determined I'm sure we're going to find out more especially on why none of these Thirteen devices actually blew up and of course\nThere were more devices that were discovered\nToday we had some ... to to count here the first device was sent to Georgia source so that was the the device that was first discovered\nAt George Soros this house the Clintons got a package deal bombers got a package Maxine Waters got two packages and in fact apparently it was a evidence on on one of the Maxine Waters packages it was late and fingerprint\nFrom one of the package of sent the Maxine Waters that they lifted the print off of that you know with with all of the the potential areas for an individual to screw up\nBecause you look the fees on below up she looked at these devices they didn't look very sophisticated so I figured that was going to be a skin or a hair or a fingerprint\nIf all of a scotch tape that was used to\nPut the labels down that were printed on a laser jet or an ... printer\nTo cut out and then plastered on top of these manila padded on blogs and then you know shipping tape clear shipping tape put over you know they got a fingerprint on one of these packages and that's what the on well this and then of course some DNA evidence was also\nOn ah some of the other packages as well\nSo late in fingerprint from ah was it the one of the water's ... belongs\nTo them and maybe some DNA from one of the waters I was trying to write and and pay attention during the pressure and I got something an audio we'll get to ingest admitted so that Clinton was Obama's George Soros a Maxine Waters you had um [noise]\nJoe Biden and with two packages or you had a the

then a a Tom Sawyer and then apparently Tom Steyer also was the recipient so I Wonder if if Chuck Schumer is feeling left out\nIs Nancy Pelosi feeling left out hey I Want to go to phones here and I I'm going to be very very very very clear I Am going to be very direct\nThat the phones over the last couple of days have been packed\nWith caller is saying that this was a democratic false flag that the Democrats were behind this you know many people thought that the Democratic party or or of a democratic operatives were behind this to make it look like a Trump nuts\n\nAnd I'm looking at the whole screen here for colds that you know want to maybe correct what they said I'm just I'm just not seeing those types of calls\nHold folks whether you want to believe it or not I'm going to say this

exactly why he he came up with this idea and the the the only one or there's are there others beside him\nAnd the Democrats have asked for people who have the Republicans having the president has been saying stuff I mean he he says you know that the rhetoric or whatever but they're not going to do with this guy they find out why he did this and if he's there\nAs as a perfect way to blame the president by looking at van for gun right now I think could be set up you could be a a A R ... be a top of things here and by\nThe about apparently he did register as a Republican and he did vote for Trump be voted\nRepublican in twenty sixteen that's a long way to lay this that I just think we were dealing with the ranged individual then I think like Trump and dislikes the Democrats and as far as finding out others involved\nUh there were apparently five pen register warrants on this guy civil deal to see any calls that he made who we spoke to a mate or received phone calls I'm going to get

agency in Broward County now the arrest was made implantation the arrest was made at an auto zone get into the cell phone on ozone ah this this was a uh\nApparently he was a frequent customer the auto zone\nA initial report said he was an employee there apparently that's not the case but his van was parked in the auto zone they were following him they've been all this guy for a least a day\nOr a day plus they pretty much had their sights on it they they took him down at the auto zone and this is police traffic audio\nOr a police scanner traffic a and you can hear them talking about the suspect vehicle\nAnd they even use signal forty six now in in Broward County a signal forty six that's code for bomb threats I and many other police agencies also will you single forty six a brown county single forty six is definitely bomb threats\nSo listen to this police scanner audio from just before the takedown just before the arrest\nOr just on when the ... the um\n[noise] are offering\nFor a correction just just after the arrest is what I should say so here we go and we're all from the beginning\nWe just don't I mean the company I'm referencing a forty hour car and I'm not sure we weren't around shut down and then we're very accurate and we use the mark you're wearing the than the north of the auto zone\nSo they're asking for more units to clear the traffic because you know they're trying to figure out you know ... is this van clear to is there an explosive devices what materials in the van hey folks this nut job might have made the bombs inside the van because there's some speculation that might've been living in this van\nThe van is a cluttered mess the windshield that when when the tarp blew off a\nAnd you could see the expose windshield from some of the proper shots as they were hauling the van away I don't know what the hell's on the front dashboard of his old dodge ram\nBut I it it looks like maybe a whole bunch a baseball cap the whole front dashboard is littered\nAlmost to the extent that when you know people back in the you know a couple of years back he's the take all those stuffed animals and and cram 'em in the back windshield or the back window of their vehicle you know what I'm Talking about this man is just a cluttered mess so that that's the audio\nPolice scanner audio Broward County implantation Florida just after they took him into custody at the auto zone we\nJust don't I mean the company I'm referencing a forty hour car and I'm not sure we weren't around ...\nAn hour is the single forty six is bomb threat he says we want the road shut down\nAnd then we're very accurate and how we use the mark you're wearing the lord of the auto zone\nI said earlier just a little flavor as to what's going on now before I go back to phone calls and I got to get into the chip and held dancer aspect of it there's a system some nutty stuff that's coming out here oh Hillary okay now\nSee I've looked at my wall monitor CNN sources suspect that the suspect was living in the sticker covered van that he was living in a van down by\nWith a whole bunch of stickers on it\nSpeaking of the stickers and we just took a call before the bottom of the hour break\nAnd the caller was like you know I'm calling from Orlando I live in Florida and it was the folks I I've lived in Florida in Nineteen Ninety two I've had stickers on some cars I'm not really a sticker person but you know some stickers a faded some stickers have have done fairly well but the caller\nEssentially emulating what a bunch of ah my my Twitter\nFollowers or people that have responded to me on Twitter are saying and they think that this smells that the stickers or in too good of a condition\nA my president no path to Seventy landslide it was three and six nominee uh and then there's you know images of ah Toby Allen\nThere's the images of a couple of other countries singers I Believe\nI you know this collage it looks like it's one a sticker or one poster board type sticker\nThat he could have had multiples if he's been driving around with this for a couple of years or he is the digital file on a thumb drive and what it said he goes in Princeton New one I mean so if\nYou have to go Schmidt yeah I'd just like to say this guy supposedly is living out of his van maybe to get the money for the full color graphics and the postage for all these pipe bombs\nWell the postage you know six forever uh stamps is three bucks\n[laughter] so you know he's he's got a pipe\nBombs this pipe bombs way what would cost Fifteen to twenty bucks to ship ships all the time\nRight and guess what I don't know the weight of them they were they weren't metal pipes they work PVC pipe so that's going to be a whole lot that is going to be a whole lot to hold on a second ... put Dave on hold let me listen to the Trump\n... where I president from speaking I just moments ago on the White House lawn rightfully\nSo it was a big thing right now we have this on the Republican vendors haven't always in the valley\nSo he was talking about the the bombing arrest\nDo you have a lot of Senate races where we're leading\nTo the president now talking about the upcoming
