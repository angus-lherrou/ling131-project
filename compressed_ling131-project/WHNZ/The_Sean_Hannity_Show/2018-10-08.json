[noise]\nDon't know why I'm going to get into Kevin on just a second just to review some of the of confirmations a for years gone by and understanding this\nColossal shift in\nHow regardless of what side of the aisle you were on how we essentially used to vote and we'll get into that and just a bit but as far as this this horrific limousine this a stretch SUV crash\nIn New York state now when this happened is a place called sky herring and sky Harry and I think I've been through there is about forty miles to the west of Albany and when you think about twenty people dead Eighteen andme a limo\nSeventeen passengers the limo driver that's Eighteen died in a limo and then to people\nOutside of this a farm stand a restaurant now we're in the parking lot at the wrong place at the wrong time for a total death toll of Eighteen people the governor of New York who I Am not a fan of at all obviously\nI find them to be quite an in Brazil actually bought a he had said and I the politics out of the equation I just you know I'm not a lot of Cuomo fan or obviously\nBut he had said earlier today the limo had recently failed its inspection\nAnd this vehicle should not have been on the road at all\nAnd that the driver did not have the correct endorsement he didn't have a limo license so and the limo company apparently has a litany of issues where vehicles have been taken out of service due to inspection issues\nAnd their problems are multiple times the national average from limousine companies with the number of problems they had just just an awful awful story and as I was telling you before I'm not a tweet but a text message from one of the deceased\nInside this limo or turns out that uh she sent the text message to a relative\nThat the vehicle was in terrible condition this was prior to the crash just awful now as far as my little speech here\nI don't know why people drop their guard\nFor whatever reason people will get into the back of limousines and one is this feeling of inherent a safety that oh we're not going to have a car crash there's not going to be an accident don't need to put my seatbelt done I don't know what it is but it's not just limousines\nIt's also people that ride in taxis people that ride in the you know ... for instance or a Juno wars you know some of the other\nYou know v is some of the other uh you know car come in a nationwide is pretty much over and lift but you've got some places that are that have some of these other young up and coming services as well why is it hey I'm Bob Simon the CBS News corresponded sixty minutes Bob Simon\nHe died in New York City a couple of years back Bob Sykes\nAnd one was in the back of one of those you know black cars you know the Lincoln town car services and he was in an accident he was in the backseat didn't have a seat belt on\nWhy is it that people that there's a false sense of security when you ride in the back but especially I feel that when people get um delivery cars taxis or over type vehicles limos that oh what changes\nWhen you get in your car\nIn the front seat or the passenger seat buckle up most people buckle up but there is this this this dropping of people's guard when they get into certain vehicles and I was mentioned Bob Simon from CBS News he got into a a a one of these black car limos\nUh because he spends millions of dollars on signs on highways a naming bridges after his father and not a dime for for a traffic light at the intersection or some sort of mediating traffic device that might have a a forestall the prevented this accident\nI'm sure there's going to be fully investigated the NTSB again involves there'll be a full report on or any of those culpable in this crash George thanks for the call I appreciate it I back over the cabin on and I wanted to grab that call because it was very relevant to what I was just discussing\nSo as you know a Brett Kavanaugh has been converted a confirmed on Saturday and I'm just looking at at some of the numbers in years gone by which really is fascinating so if I watch this I Know that a lot of the country was glued to the television to watch\nUh this historic vote\nOn a Saturday\nA and of course this is a a a totally divided Senate along party lines for the most part a fifty to forty eight votes to confirm Kavanaugh yeah it doesn't add up to a hundred you had the Republican Steve Gaines who we told you was going to be walking his daughter down the aisle\nOr in his home state on Saturday he wasn't present a Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or was not at a winning a she was the lone Republican who voted against cloture\nTo end debate on friday and you know at the last minute she offered a little bit of an olive branch to Republicans ah she ended up voting present instead of no against\nKavanaugh and when Murkowski voted present\nOut that was more of an an optics thing so Kavanaugh was not confirmed by just one single vote since Danes was that his daughter's wedding and was not there to vote yes you know the last time and this is where I Want to look at the stats here\nThe last time that a justice was confirmed by that slim of a margin was in a teen eighty one when Stanley Matthews was confirmed twenty four to twenty three\nAnd even Clarence Thomas going back to Nineteen Ninety One after the whole Anita Hill affair Clarence Thomas was voted in with a four vote margin so that's\nThe way that Kavanaugh ended and fifty to forty eight\nVice president Mike Pence see did preside over the vote because the vice president United States is the president of the U.S Senate and he was there as a tie breaker if needed but again you know he was constantly interrupted by these a noxious screaming mean these\nAre protesting yeah they were they were going off like death charges it was like every you know it was like what a what a building is demolished and the charges are are staggered\nHave these protesters daisy chain staggered and one would scream they'd be hauled out and then they get going again another would start screaming and then rinse and repeat it just happened over and over again or\nThe president tweeted a and for Fifteen PM so that the confirmation happened in the Trump tweeted I applied to congratulate the U.S Senate for confirming our great nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court later today I'll sinus commission of appointments and he'll be officially sworn in very exciting\nAnd he was sworn in using a family Bible by chief justice John Roberts\nAnd retired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there at that private ceremony because Kavanaugh uh obviously clerked for Kennedy also replacing Kennedy now some of the confirmation vote tallies going back\nTo uh the last well we'll we'll go back a certain number of years here will go back to the seventies\n[noise] uh Neil Gorsuch a Trump's first nominee Gorsuch was confirmed fifty four to forty five back in twenty Seventeen a language

twelve fifty W H ...\nMichael and we have the latest advisory come out\nLittle less than an hour ago the five o'clock eastern four\nO'clock central advisory and regarding hurricane Michael we have a lot of listeners in the panhandle\nUh my show was heard in Panama City on Ninety four point five FM I'm also heard immobile and uh Pensacola as well so uh and I've been through this drill a lot joining us right now from the national Hurricane Center in Florida is Stacy ... senior hurricane specialist\nStacey thanks for coming on the show I Want to get the latest with at five o'clock advisory\n[noise] well as the five pm eastern time advisory hurricane Mike was located a very near the western chip of Cuba has continued move northward it's now probably located about do say twenty miles or so north\nOf the western to Cuba still moving northward a speech somewhere around eight to ten miles an hour which fucked up motion to continue tonight\nAnd tomorrow morning and then a graduate turn to the north northwest is expected tomorrow afternoon and in a couple of days we're expecting a Michael to make landfall somewhere in the Florida Panhandle\nUh near major hurricane strength now Stacy I've been watching this obviously and I'm trying to employ my listeners especially along the Gulf Coast ah to the east to Panama City to the big band and to the west to Panama City over towards Pensacola\nTo prepare and prepared quickly the difference here is\nAnd I tried to illustrate this for the audience typically you know we're watching these hurricanes as they they roll off the Cape Verde and they can they they\nThey courage across the Atlantic and into the southern Caribbean and if they just take a long time and we were able to watch and you watch the cones shrink and grow and and you know all the forecast in this case the difference here with Michael\nIs this has formed in the Gulf of Mexico essentially\nAnd the preparation time is so much more compressed because we're dealing with an event that's really just two days away\nThat's correct Todd uh the system's only been a lot technically for about two days and it's going to make landfall in roughly another two days so this is gonna be you know easily less than a week\nOr event and we want folks in the Florida Panhandle everywhere in the Florida Panhandle not just focusing on where the forecast track is supposed to be but\nUh especially folks are living in the areas east of where Michael was forecast make landfall when people are going to be a very broad on the east side the Florida Big Bend area is highly susceptible to storm surge because of the concave shaping the coastline and the shallow water there so there's going to be significant storm surge many miles away\nFrom where the storm makes landfall and then of course everybody who's going to be located east\nOf where Michael makes landfall you're now in the heavy rainfall threat the tornado threat so uh just because this joined track might end up being sixty eight even a hundred miles away from you or you know to the west of you please don't feel that you're going to be inside company\nStacey did I see that the u._k. model is starting to run and more agreement\nWith the U.S models that is\nCorrect but it's still out there on the right side showing you know perhaps landfall near or just east of Appalachian coal Florida and we need to remind folks that are\nA two day a forty hour forecast errors or you know pretty much on the order of about a Seventy nautical miles so that could be anywhere from uh the Florida Big Bend area too as far west as almost to Pensacola so we don't want people focusing entirely on\nWhere our forecast track as a showing it making landfall right now that could change a little bit over the course of pot\nI let's talk intensity now over the years the actual forecasts path has gotten better intensity is still one of those areas where we're still trying to get better\nI so now where where where in a category one the five o'clock eastern advisory for central had a maximum sustained winds at eighty miles an hour or so up five from the intermediate forecasted at two PM\nAnd you guys are projecting it to intensify with two and then potentially a three what makes landfall on the Florida coastline is that correct\nThat's correct were explicitly forecasting a store to become a major hurricane and about thirty six hours while it's still out of where the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico or then as it makes a term or to the north northeast and biggest approached the Florida Panhandle might see a little bit of slight weakening but still be near", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "08"}
