Bush or whomever so again I support the president going to Pittsburgh the president of the temple the synagogue\nSays he's my president he's welcomed but you contrast that with the fact that the mayor of Pittsburgh the mayor's name is bill do though\nHe wants no part of the Trump he says I'm not I'm not going to be with Trump I'm not going to be at the airport when he arrives which is pretty standard for mayors and and and dignitaries to appear he says no not going to be there are also the county executive his name is rich Fitzgerald he's not going to be there\nThe governor of Pennsylvania is Tom Wolfe and he will also not meet with Trump and an interestingly all of the congressional leaders also declined the ride\nTo attend with the president and first lady so Mitch McConnell\nThe Senate majority leader Paul Ryan the outgoing speaker of the house of of course on the Republican side they said no that they did not accept the invite to go and then on the Democratic leadership side Chuck Schumer the Senate minority leader and the Nancy Pelosi\nOr the the devil leader for the house of representatives or below sea and Schumer also declined\nBut really the before we move on and we're going to monitor the president when he arrives in if he speaks and we'll bring you audio during the course of the show this I'm telling you right now that this is a Trump damned if you do damned if you don't situation\nPresident Trump deciding to go which again I think is the right thing to do a he's being met with some resistance but again you have the leader of the synagogue that was the center of the attack the target\nThe head of the synagogue is saying he's my president he's welcome you don't want that to me is what counts the most\nSo if Trump didn't show up\nIt'd be attacked or how callously disease you know he's on Twitter he's talking about this and he hasn't gone to Pittsburgh so I think this is a classic example of\nThe president is heading there and he's taken flack and and criticism from individuals but if he didn't go he'd be take the same individuals probably would be saying the same thing about or just reverse that can't believe the president is not making a trip so again damned if you do damned if you don't\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is the nationwide number Iran Schmidt I did see in Pittsburgh media\nThat a Mayor Bill or William for judo the mayor of Pittsburgh he wanted President Trump to wait so hold off on his presidential visit until all the funerals had been completed of\nThe victims which again I mean could the president have done\nMade a statement that he's going to wait I surely caught them but again I think that in a time of uh of grieving and morning that\nPresidents do make appearances to the best of my recollection on a similar timeframe so again I I I don't fault the president and I'm guessing that if he didn't show up\nThat he'd be the the subject of of criticism and and ridiculed for that I wound up show today you know Whitey Bolger them the famous uh mobster Whitey Bolger apparently lack\nIn a federal locked up in West Virginia the take home to the players\nAre so in West Virginia and why the ball he's been moved all over the place where every big Boston mobster and then he was on the run for what about sixteen

Bolger head FBI protection for years because he was a an informant so I Wonder if that has to do with you know why he was taken out and did they know that they put them in a facility apparently was some other inmates connected to the mob\nOr ... more is going to come out but the ... those are the early rumblings so Whitey Bolger taken out which is\nIt's quite incredible what's the fiduciary responsibility of the federal prison system to protect a guy like Whitey Bolger\nCertainly caught some folks off guard guessing the war was going to have a a finger to to\nAnswer might get a phone

Kara Swisher about she brings up about a Cory Booker saying you know kicked them when in fact he wasn't Cory Booker was Eric Holder 'cause we played that audio by not ten days ago whatever so she brings up\nThe wrong name Corey Booker instead of Eric Holder and listen to what happens next\nWhat do you think of quaint okay kinda hanging up by I don't want anything that anything and I actually start to get to that\nLike well I called her ... okay yeah I Know they all look alike I think\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell done they all look really\nI mean that if if a talk show host said that Megan Kelly for instance if she had said that that would also that's worse than what she did on NBC that that all the more that old suggestion that\nAgain if this had been a conservative if this had been a Republican\nOr even other members of the media or even even if it were a a a more liberal member of the media not just you know somebody on the conservative side of the media\nI Can't imagine what the hell broke loose the fire the theory that come full of grace should that would ensue if someone suggested like Hillary\nI tried to make light trying to make a joke even in that context to suggest that all black guys look alike really and\nIs the outrage torn to Hillary Clinton or the interviewer here and the waivers thing unfolding and then the laughter afterwards if you're unfamiliar\nIf you miss that I play in this at the very end of last hour I Want to play it again there was an interview some kind of a ... interview a panel discussion of some type or a moderate this woman an interview with ... code and the woman's name the interviews name is terror Swisher about\nIf I'm pronouncing that properly\nAnd she asks about the comments that was made about encouraging you know Democrats or you know ... kick Republicans when they go low Eric Holder said that that was on video and audio we played it a couple of weeks back\nAnd the interviewer confused what Eric Holder and said and claimed that it was Cory Booker and then Hillary corrects the interviewer from Reed code however\nWhat do you think of ... and kind of having to fly I adore ... start to get to that\nLike having Eric Holder ... yeah I Know they all look alike now they ...\n[laughter]\nWhoa [noise] so she says oh well done you know Hillary is snickering and laughing you can tell she was trying to make a funny there but if anyone\nElse had made that's funny my God I don't even want to him what\nWould happen\nIf a radio talk shows that said that if they were not fired than they would be boycotted there'd be a protest\nOr

they all look alike I think ...\n\n\nThat is on a believable where is the outrage\nAnd eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide nobody around ...\nIf you're on hold hang on a we're talking about race here I Want to just pick up I comment that we have a Lester Holt situations Jimmy Fallon situation we have what happened with Megan Kelly at NBC then we'll go back to your calls here and just a minute so it's been uncovered that Lester Holt\nFor Halloween once dressed\nAs Susan Boyle\nSo Lester Holt had some ... foot on an essentially Lester Holt put on white face NBC nightly news is Lester Holt so on the heels of Megan Kelly who didn't own Berkley\nUh say that a black face was\nShe didn't say hey what's wrong with black face a I've got no problem with it I ever wants to be able to do black face if they want first of all I disagree with that and I I'm also offended\nBy the the minstrel show black face and the exaggerations and the the attempt back then to make a black people look or an educated and stupid I I find that offensive\nAnd I had a conversation with my kids about this and the whole Megan Kelly story we talked about this last week and in fact went to YouTube and you can find some old black and white or Nineteen thirties a minstrel show or or black face acts on YouTube and it's like oh my God\nWith the dialect and just it just the cartoonish it's offensive\nNot Megan Kelly again she didn't put a seal of approval and say hey what's wrong with black face what she had done and she stepped in it you know a little bit but I don't think she meant that I I don't I'm not a professional Megan Kelly defender here my wife can't stand Megan Kelly\nI I I don't dislike Megan Kelly but with what happened with her it was not recognizing
