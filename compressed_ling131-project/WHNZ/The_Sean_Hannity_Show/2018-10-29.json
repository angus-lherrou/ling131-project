were\nKilled I mean that's thankfully no children were killed it it doesn't make it doesn't take the sting away from what happened but you know the ages of those that were killed were between fifty

the monsters name Robert Bowers forty six years old and he's been smacked with twenty nine criminal counts\n\nOn this attack at the synagogue in Pittsburgh which by all accounts everything that I've heard and read this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the United states\nIn our history\nWe've also been now made aware that Jeff Sessions the attorney general has directed as prosecutors in Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh to seek the death penalty so this is going to be a death penalty case\nI Can't imagine what it must have been like Saturday morning if a tree of life synagogue\nThere were three different congregations that we're holding services on the Sabbath Shabaab\nOn Saturday morning to three different congregations were utilizing a different areas apparently and all three were affected ah from what what I've seen here\nWe have a six others so at the eleven dead and it was eight men and three women I mentioned earlier that the ages fifty four to Ninety

decades since they were little kids\nAh everyone loves them they were full of life and personality despite the fact that they had some developmental problems that we are a fixture epicenter God just awful so the eleven did\nSix others were injured including for police officers also the stories about the heroics of the Pittsburgh Police going in\nThat's what you do when you have an active shooter

the microscope\nWith Trump he is even more under the microscope\nCouple audio bites that I wanted to play from me Sarah Huckabee Sanders press conference from earlier today on the first news or in a long time I think since early September\nIf I'm not mistaken so little um altercation with Jim Acosta there was an interesting episode was Sarah Sanders and Jonathan Karl from ABC News will get into that in a bit\nNow with the president when I just said about the president being under the microscope whoever the president isn't with Trump even more so because valley's a different kind of president a different kind of guy and he\nClearly handles the media much differently\nAnd he's a bulldozer\nAnd he does things different than other presidents have in the past the president I must say that a lot of these issues and similarities didn't occur behind the scenes a lesson\nThat Obama's White House Obama's administration they had an adversarial position with the press the press were locked out of many events the difference is is that Obama would not have these temp sore spots in front of the media\nAnd subtle say hey it's better to have this out in the open it provides a or the ability for everyone to see what's happening it it it opens up a green pastures porn can\nView it's happening and see what's happening versus what happens secretly quietly behind closed doors\nAnd the Obama administration and his staff talking about the media who they like they don't like I had to keep the media away from certain events that Trump does it in public\nFor all of us to see and you've got an asshole so then if we're able to see all of their Senate if they get sunshine and sunlight that what the hell happens behind the ... that could be even crazier\nThe point I'm trying to make is the president's tweets from this morning\nI've been very clear I Do not like the enemy of the people I think it's destructive I don't think that it is any place for a president of the United states to call the media the enemy of the people or\nThe delineation of the fake news is the enemy of the people but then you know he'll call CNN and then and and the NBC and MSNBC the fake news so essentially he's calling them the enemy of the people because you're qualifying so to tweets this morning and again I just I don't think that\nThe president should be engaged in this type of Twitter activity especially under the microscope especially since we've had the pipe bombs from last week the synagogue shooting from Saturday morning the president this morning\nIn his first tweet this was [noise] see what what time was this a well he had to hit the actually three tweets don't want to go over because the one this morning rolled out at eight o three am but about twelve hours earlier\nIn the eight o'clock hour last night so Sunday night the president tweeted the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives enemy for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country\nFirst thing that the president didn't was condemned the attack sloth in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media\nLikes this goes on and they they tangled little further\nDown the road here Louis ministry patients that major news networks first public statement was to blame the president and myself included I mean that is outrageous that anybody other than the individual who carried out the friend would hold that responsibility for these are\nSo there we go and you could say she's riled up I mean and she's a mostly affected by what she just talk by the end the conversation but listen it's her job to\nActually have the president's backing and following his position even if she doesn't always agree and I don't think Sarah Huckabee Sanders always agrees and I I'm pretty confident she would not officially endorse enemy of the people\nIf you have the opportunity to honestly say whether she likes it or not so I promised

process for you\nNow that's Lynette Lederman she is the former presidents of the tree of life synagogue so we're we have the current leader saying the president is always welcome former president saying no we don't want the president here [noise]\nIt just shows you know there's a split among those that belong to the synagogue I just don't think I I\nI just don't think that a position of saying the president's not welcome I don't think that's warranted\nAnd the president United States coming to help the community heal and try to use the cover all he's divisive his terminology the words he uses a not help I I just don't think that that that has a place I think the president's ah the the the current head of the synagogue has it right\nThe rabbi Jeffrey minds he has it right the president United States is welcome any time and I think that's the right answer and not just a an answer I think it's the correct thing to walk and the correct thing to say\nYou know the president was hit with some criticism that he did mention that hey this might not have happened if they had an armed guard and listen that's a fair comment just not immediately\nAnd I think the Trump lacks that mechanism on sometimes timing of when to say what and I fundamentally agree with him I agree with that\nGuess what if there were armed parishioners or in this case a\nCongregants of the synagogue a that may be an armed or individual can stop this person or if there were security in the lobby or at the synagogue when you had three different congregations holding three different services\nI Do agree but I don't think I Would have rolled that out as one of the first things that I said in response to the massacre but I thought it was interesting to hear just two different takes on from coming to town I think it's the right thing to do and I I think the president first lady should make their way\nAnd try to help with the healing process\nIn Pittsburgh eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number eight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you agree disagree want to get on brings something new to the table another area of agreements that I have with the president is\nThe sending in troops to the U.S border now it has been up\nUh I don't want any type of military confrontation and most likely troops are not going to be arm or if they are they will not be permitted to fire at migrants that try to break into the country and I shouldn't be the case we should not that I I\nI mean that an image of some kind of a you know I'm like I had a massive Kent State like massacre I I don't want to see that but the president is a hundred percent right\nTo protect the sovereignty and our borders and one was eight hundred troops last week now it looks like they're going to be\nA about fifty two hundred troops deploying to the southern border as this migrant caravan keeps rolling north saying that they're coming in\n... court will reinforce along priority points of and freeze so as to enhance border patrols ability to harden and secure the border\nThat's terrorists are shorter a that's Terence oh Shauna see who was an air force general and he's the head of the U.S northern command\nAnd this was at a pressure in Washington\nAnd at the deployment will be completed by the end of this week\nI have no issue with is the president has all the right to protect our borders and the sovereignty of the United states of America\nWe want immigrants we're a nation of immigrants you do it the proper way you don't form a mob chain of a caravan and say hey we're about seven thousand strong now or I saw numbers fourteen thousand for whatever the number is\nJust mow your way to the southern border and say hey we're coming they like it or not no we don't like it and you're not permanent\nXena phobia that is not anti immigrant\nOh it's anti lawlessness and trying to smash your way through\nOur border and the president has all the rights\nTo request troops sent probes and now we're up to\nFifty two hundred troops and man is uh James Mattis the secretary of defense\nI'm also it said this was a this morning as well that ah the military has already started bringing in equipment and those Jersey barriers to assist the troops are to try to force this caravan\nFrom trying to push its way into the United states I have a couple of calls here eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's how you get on any comments on Pittsburgh\nUh oh some new details on the pipe bomb or with the fifteenth bomb I Believe discovered and then you know those that are saying oh false flag oh the stamps won't even canceled walk as I said last week there's an explanation for that\nOff and we'll get to that and just a bit how about we grab her in Danbury, Connecticut hurt your next on Schmidt welcome\nThank you and I appreciate your taking my call I also appreciate your attention dental actual honesty uh as someone who's more on the progressive side I appreciate your loving to fix the truth at times while your colleagues Maggie uncomfortable with that\nI'm having said that a\nCouple of things I just point so I wanted to make real quickly now as far as the people who are coming to our border from Central America they're actually coming as refugees which means they're or they're claiming to be refugees\nSo that makes them entirely legally entitled by all of our treaty to add to the United states as refugees\nAnd what makes your argument about not coming in here illegally disingenuous is the administration and Justice Department have her personally reduce the number of judges to hear those refugee asylum cases legally\nWhich fortunate these people to get back up at the illegal checkpoints and finally out of desperation a lot of them will come over the illegal checkpoints and immediately turn themselves in\nA while the current law I live in a car loan let ... let me let me let me ask you let let me let me take this step by step first of all I'm not being disingenuous and understand the the right for someone to claim refugee status and\nThe ability to a historically have a hearing the problem is we we usually you deal with some ones these Tuesdays fives these ten these okay a hundred or so this is a mob\nThis is a in many cases a scripted situation\nMany of the individuals that are being interviewed they've got the same story claiming to be refugees well I'll tell you what if you feel unsafe in Honduras in water you apply for refugee status and try to move to Guatemala one country up or what what about Mexico why don't you stay in Mexico than\nThe fact is is they're using in many cases and I truly believe it is the guise of I'm In danger I'm a refugee please help me\nThey're looking for that as a way to get into the United states just for economic betterment not necessarily 'cause there weren't any type of danger for the most part current I I think I see and most of us see right through this\nThis organized a pilgrimage which is politically motivated or economically motivated and I'm Sorry it's not like they're running to our back door because someone's chasing them through the woods with a knife\nAnd agree to disagree on that one I don't consider a bunch of stragglers mostly women and children to the mountain and nobody has been able to identify with a single Middle Eastern or in this for for less than five thousand and there's still a month\nI I never said by the way I never said that and I'm not one of the conservative talk radio guys that\nYou know foment did that story and I even called that out that listen I'm sure there might be a middle Easterner but there's it's not I mean there there could be but I'm not using that as a talking point to try to force the caravan\nNo I think the caravan should be Florida because they're running into the country illegally and they're trying to storm our border with uh hey\nWe're getting him come hell or high water but I've never been one to jump on the bandwagon and say oh there are middle Easterners in there they could be terrorists than there I've seen absolutely zero substantiate Asian\nThat there's any Middle Eastern or or any organization will ever to bring Middle Eastern resume that might have the ferry as purposes and I brought that up but last week I brought that up by numerous times\nI appreciate that and by the way they're attempting to come here legally as a violent shaking refugees they're not attempting to come in here illegally\nBut on our side by reducing the number of judges to hear these cases we've created a crisis that didn't need to exist and they were coming in more than one reason Jersey for a long time now but that's actually you are coming in now than there are\nNo I'm Talking about the ones that are trying to claim refugee status current I'm just I'm ... I'm not buying I'm not buying the story on a mass wholesale level that they're all refugees they just looking to make more money there's a better life in America\nAfter you leave the country that you're being you know needing I find them from that what what\nCourage is saying is absolutely incorrect according to the United nations\nSays on all did you hear what I said I said well then if they're coming from Honduras why are they seeking asylum in Guatemala or Mexico on age or you\nKnow the law according to the international law that they can't pick and choose where they want to go that the the country that helped him the first time that they cross through should've kept them there or sent them back\nWell they have no right cause they 'cause she thought about signing limits about they want to come to America because there is a better life better cut that my tax dollars [laughter]\nThey're ... they're looking for what ever the financial entitlements whether they're looking for handouts or welfare or whatever or they're looking for a better job that pays higher wages whatever the reason is that why they're coming to this country the bulk of them with the Saab and the cover story of\nOh I'm scared and I am a strip pathetic guy I get I understand there are legitimate reasons for asylum I'm just not buying a mob of whether it's Seventy five hundred now or fourteen thousand\nThe second ... whatever the number is either stop buying you know all these stories\nAnd compassionate person if they're really having ... you know that's legitimate or not but I Wish some of the other news outlets would explain that they don't have a right to come to this country they have a right to go to the first country they stepped in and figure it out from there\nThey don't want to do that they want to come here and that's why this things turned into a total circus and a huge publicity stunt Susan thanks for the call from Vegas half hour to go and a lot to cover Red Sox and mourn next [noise]\nTechnology truth both feel like a group you have fourteen blogging passwords and you can remember any of them\nAre one or two is a ... a ... is awesome one two three\nTruth it's so easy to switch and save on car insurance Tyco dot com do you is super cool ... percent underscore exclamation point exclamation point Nineteen eighty five [noise] Fifteen minutes because they'd be Fifteen Percent or more\nThis is John Green and if your teeth or steamed from coffee tea or smoking power swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in seven days six shapes even better there is no messy strips are trait that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just wipe your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try and power\nSwabs call one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six night you're right wide smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk free\nOne eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ...

caravan invaders I like that\nI was a ... just because you disagree with the caravan and their political motivations or whatever their motivations are age it's just it's an organized event essentially and it is not\nFilled with people I truly believe that are in fear for their lives that are fleeing a and if that's the case then like I said you go to Guatemala or you go to Mexico and and try to seek asylum in no this is about coming to the United states\nAnd you've got a massive caravan and some are upset that the language that Trump and others are using that their invaders invading the
