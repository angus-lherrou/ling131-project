I'd like to eat a salad that whenever I see that I Can't really bloated and uncomfortable [noise]\nThose are the people who need a central and ... those are the people who really their firepower and it's quite attenuated and so that you know that extra\nA band with that you get with this particular spectrum of of enzymes in this and the essential enzymes alter formula\nIs really indicative for people who\nEither have a hard time feeling comfortable eating a regular healthy meal\nSo as soon as we balding we naturally selected or not to be able to digest um insoluble\nFiber right yeah ... or\n... or ... well\nOkay let's just stick with the inside it doesn't break down it you know you eat food has their ... but when it goes to the cold and the large intestine essentially on digest it\nUm yeah so but it does\nDoes it it does break down and the colon yes\nUm to some extent something not not funny I mean it's really meant to be more like a brush or\nRight you know it never really gets digested and\nNever really gets digested but soluble fiber is some people even struggle is soluble fiber switches to her\nThat you weren't gel does it does it get digested or is it that just turned into a gelatinous mass in your stomach\nAnd now in some those those soluble fibers are meant to be broken down and digested in and utilize her own it\nSo is that what is that what's causing the discomfort\nIt candy for some people yeah\nThat they're they're digestion is so poor\nAnd their PA to sell off off that they don't they're not able to feel comfortable with a regular healthy meal and that's why some people avoid vegetables because\nThey eat them and they feel horrible on them and it's because of the ... they went without eating five are both silent and signed up for so long and then they go to introduce it\nThinking oh great on doing something healthy and then they eat you know this national matter and they feel terrible and they think well\nI while I feel horrible and because you know you haven't been eating this way for so long and then you go to eat out way and you don't really have the digestive fire to do it so and that can be a really big help and you write something so perfect\nDr ... said didn't end times our unsung heroes everyone's running around talking about how bad is ... ... but they haven't even started with the basic right now and the essential to digestion which is ...\n... yeah and there are so under there are underrated they're under right and yeah\nI agree\nAnd by the way enzymes and enzymes um without enzymes and are there more than just digestive enzymes you mentioned the metabolic but are those are the ... ...\nThey make these chemical reactions happen right [noise] yeah [noise] no enzymes\nNothing's gonna happen they they just happen they facilitate\nAh all the chemical every single chemical reaction requires an enzyme doesn't it\nYeah absolutely\nAnd know ends I I just I said all the time no enzymes you die you die that I Know it through the metal ball\nLikely you won't exist and you're gone that's it you're over so could you mentioned all three products again just for reinforcement\n... absolutely so the first is our

Ninety nine of the nation wide number or how you get on the program it's a very very simple process\nSo why don't we start\nWith what's making a lot of news generating a lot of chatter today\nAnd that is the comments that the president made at the rally in Mississippi last night\n[noise] couple of things and this is obviously ruffled some feathers a first of all what's what's wrong with this particular state but I Can't find anything wrong with this is happening\nNow [noise]\nThey had gang raped by gangs [noise]\nTurned out to be wrong so many different charges [noise] guilty\nUntil proven innocent that's very dangerous Veronica\nAnd I haven't myself all the time you\nKnow I Can't argue with that I get is a guilty until proven yeah and that's what's going on uh with with capital here and you know if you go back and listen to the statement of this this is not for one of those people really ticked off but it's no this is important\nTurned out to be wrong so many different charges [noise] guilty until proven innocent and\nAgain that's a very important point there and that's what's happening\nHere because there's no a collaboration there's no proof again with the doctor Ford story in fact there were a three of those name but couldn't recall or even the the ally\nOf this this ... the legal in ties are the ally of Dr Ford could not remember the events of the party or capital I mean I I Would think that that would be a kind of an indelibly inscribed in your or whatever role was ah in your ...\nHad all that data but but no\nAnd you know those that have to and this is what's most troubling to me and I don't take sexual assault or rape lightly it'll\nIt occurs in his despicable I feel from the bottom of my heart to anyone any woman that's experienced any type of a an assault on what the touching a rape it is it is horrific\nYou have my ... most the empathy or in in that department but the way this has been treated is that cabinet by many Kevin O's already done convicted guilty he did it\nTaking Dr cat a doctor or for the word that it was an absolute proven foregone conclusion and that's just not the case All right so that was one of the items that wants to play Trump's a hundred percent right however\nThe president went a little further and this is where the president is getting a whole lot of attention here was this an intelligent move last night at this campaign style rally in Mississippi\n[noise] thirty six years ago this\nI had one beer [noise] right I Am wondering\nWell is it goes you know it was one of them are good [noise]\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't\nKnow\nI don't know [noise] what\nWas it and I don't know where's the house\nI'm downstairs where was I don't know but I had one beer that's the only thing I remember [noise]\nAs the president wrong there in the factual presentation really not time in the president's correct in what Dr Ford cannot remember the issue here\nThe ... and she did know upstairs downstairs 'cause she described that landing and she did describe the room upstairs across from a bathroom mistaken however again what was that the house I mean we get we don't even know what House it is I guess you I guess you could just write anything the point is the president for the most part\nYou're not factually incorrect in fact the president's right\nHe corner [noise] than what he said that in a different fashion that did not alienate three of the city needs what's happening\nNow that's that's what what the issue is here he could have done this in a different fashion\nUh and we already have a Collins was walking into a Senate room earlier today and TV cameras captured senator Collins commenting on what's being described as the president mocking Dr Ford last night and this is one that sounded like\nMarge Schott and frightening Iran\nCollege college saying that the president's comments were just plain wrong we had Senator Flake for instance he was on uh the today show this morning standing next to his buddy Coons [noise]\nWell I've heard there's no time and no

Seventeen years old in high school I don't care I I really don't\nI and I'm just not buying and there's just not enough factual evidence to prove that Dr Ford's allegations are correct the issue again is the president I don't think needs to install any additional\nSpeed bumps or a obstacles hurdles to get underway\nOf Brett Kavanaugh and that's why I don't think some of his comments in Mississippi last night I don't think they're actually helpful\nFolks I Can't sit here and say that the president didn't didn't openly for applause and laughs in and joining up a crowd and Mississippi didn't mock\nDr Ford now was the President Raul\nOn most of the front slow factually the president was right I brought up the same things on this program\nAbout her inconsistencies and not knowing this or that there's nothing wrong with the president could have done that it's just it's the mocking issue and today Sarah Huckabee Sanders held a White House press briefing a little after one o'clock this

attempts so you know a couple of three weeks or so so ah Sarah Sanders defended the president a um [noise]\nBut I I ... the facts were mostly right it was just the demeanor which I don't find helpful
