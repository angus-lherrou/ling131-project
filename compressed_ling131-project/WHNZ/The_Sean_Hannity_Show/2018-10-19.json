arrested after going to a playground telling children where babies come from\nA gay did yes he did he did that\nAuthorities say a Florida Man climbed on top of a playground timed climbed on top of playground equipment and began vulgar Lee explaining where babies come from as the children played ...\nOh my gosh what I've done this before is this an update on on what the the actual court cases with this kind of a story like early this year or ... he he wished he was charged\nA lame at a cushy I Know of course shame nova die\nOf St Petersburg not Florida [laughter] not not putting Alice county a bunch of St Petersburg Russia\nAnd she's been charged with using social media platforms to create less willingness thousands of social media accounts also creating email accounts\nThat all are designed to make it look like it was coming from a United States citizen that it was coming from somebody here in the U.S to according to\nThe charging documents to create an amplify divisive social media and political content\nAmong the ... are among the\nTopics here according to the wire reports and this is a combination I think this is Associated Press and NBC News or the topics that were uh were broached here gun control of the women's march the NFL anthem\nSituation gun control and I say gun control gay rights\nAre also picking up on specific events also a fomenting a discourse on the horrific Las Vegas shooting\nA little over a year ago on the strip of the country concert also oh I'm trying to stir things up with that that Charlottesville debacle that unite the Right rally\nUh there were numerous a political positions that were taken it wasn't just one it was just trying to sway opinion\nYou also had American politicians that were attacked Paul Ryan John McCain Mitch McConnell\nA former president Brock Obama or\nJohn McCain did I say McCain Marco Rubio or on the list here or\nThe federal prosecutors in the court charging documents\nAre they included a display of these are fake Internet uh graphics these these Internet means if you will\nThat were posted and then try to circulate via all these bogus social media accounts are pretending to be\nAmerican people trying to push this narrative out when in fact you have a a woman heading this thing up in St Petersburg Russia ah\n[noise]\nI've got some examples of the means you don't get to that in a second again this is just breaking up kind of a rolling through this a live having a chance to look through all the charging documents here uh the federal prosecutors said this Russian woman ...\nIs a chief accountant for a Russian organization called the project locked huh\nWhich they get their money from a a rich Russian dude otherwise known as an oligarchy\nOr his connected the Concorde companies and they were also involved in a separate indictment that was brought back in July by Robert Mueller's team\nAnd they were accused of metal linger attempted meddling back in the twenties sixteen election so here we are new Russian vets like you know I got to be honest here a false breaking news here on Smith I don't think I'm is worried about this Russian meddling [noise]\nAs I Am about\nThe Texas Democrats meddling no known Russians here\nAlthough I get to that you're the second one of the means quickly let me let me bring this thing up but I just I downloaded a file\nOn one of the Russian means for instance a ... to to try to sway voters or to so um anger and and discourse one of the means that there's a Russian woman\n[noise] ah put out is a photo of a what appears to be a Mexican or Central American family\nOr a a father or mother who's pregnant clearly with a big baby bump sitting down and then a whole bunch of other kids in their laps\nAnd ... it's a photo of what they want you to think or are illegal aliens are either in this country are coming to the country and you must Internet me with the photo of what's purported to be illegals\nThe caption the graphic says every the port is illegal household saves taxpayers seven hundred thousand dollars that's why it is very important to keep families together\nAs they're all being deported so again you've got multiple things at play here just one of the the means but going back to that I pick your curiosity here or that I'm not as concerned with the Russian meddling per se ... unless you know\nAgain I'm being slightly facetious here yes there is no place for Russian meddling the Chinese are meddling multiple governments are those are the two biggies the Russians are the Chinese and there was zero tolerance to zero place for this and\nIt it is in foreign countries trying to interfere with our democratic process you in the United states and I've got a zero tolerance it did happen back in twenty sixteen or it is happening now we knew what was happening we've been talking about the continuation of this for months and months and months almost and I'm\nI'm not trying to downplay Russian meddling is a problem a Trump needs to be tougher with let them your ... name has come around a little bit but not as tough as he should have been in the beginning uh and I've got zero tolerance however let me tell you what else either zero tolerance for\nHow about Texas Democrats\nAnd their election meddling yeah talking about interference I got you interference right here right here I Am from what I mean literally ... right here [noise] [laughter] got it right here [laughter]\nA headline ... this is from Washington Times Texas Democrats ask non citizens to register to vote and they even sent
