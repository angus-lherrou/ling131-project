S. and of course it's a a a large bulk\nOf Central Americans migrating through Mexico and then getting into our tempting to get into the United states and the president is threatening to order that the U.S military\nBe sent to the southern border to sealing off to close the border with Mexico I and the issue we have\nIs we have this new caravan of Central American migrants trying to get into the United states and we have the president who's aggravated with the Central American nations a couple of tweets here\nFrom the president today I'm watching the Democratic party led because they want to open borders and existing week laws assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras\nAnd El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S\n[noise] uh all this is true there's nothing that the president has said that is in dispute here in\nAddition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control of the population I must and the strongest of terms asked Mexico just stop this onslaught and unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border [noise]\nA problem with this I don't know if Mexico can't stop this if the country's the Central American countries can't stop their people\nThen we have the full rights to protect our our sovereignty and our borders is\n\nThe one with more helpful\nYou can listen on our for our radio ads [noise] downloading\nMusic CBS News on the hour sponsored by the recruiter\nIf a journalist in particular lost their life at the\nHands of violence that's an affront to the free and independent press around the world Pence said this is Mike Pence and there will be consequences\nAnd Pence has clearly taken a tough stand on this show gay men and the president you know who is again I\nHe's been a little ... in what he said to me to you because he's done a series of interviews or a series of comments have been recorded by the media\nAnd you know it it went from you know the a P interview where he said here's the here we go again it's another case of guilty until proven innocent um but then he said that it looks like he's dead that's a ... just a few minutes ago certainly looks like the show he's dead\nAnd then he certainly hopes not less than a Trump also trying to preserve the arms deal I get I understand that but again you got to put a human decency above all else eater and Mike Pence the vice president\nIs clearly taking a little tougher than ah than the president right now lives in this administration in Trump is going to end up doing the right thing here I I don't know I don't know what\nThe ultimate story from the Saudis is going to be but if it is to\nBlame on members of this interrogation team for this um it was just the questioning gone bad again\n[noise] that doesn't add up and I are we going to buy that are we going to take that excuse 'cause that's going to stick to the you know what an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine major why nobody here on Smith\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine but the news is very fluid and breaking on his that's why we're spending a lot of time on\nAh the president at the southern border I Want to pick up where I left off 'cause I got to the end of last hour I Want to just address is a little more and again the threat from President Trump to send the military to seal off the southern border\nBecause of this uh in flocks and the inability for Mexico to stop the Hondurans and Guatemalans et cetera uh those from El Salvador from coming\nThrough Central America into Mexico and then tried to get into the United states first of all these countries need to stop this\nEl Salvador Honduras Guatemala they need to stop this and then the Mexicans the Mexican government certainly can do a hell of a lot more if their respective governments where these people are coming from can't stop them all the Mexicans can certainly do a hell of a lot more\n[noise] and we have this this humongous caravan you've got an estimated four thousand Central Americans on the way through Mexico\nTo the United states they don't have visas they don't have American Express cards they don't master car they don't even have diners club\nAnd they're headed to the United states they say they think so they don't have any travel documents\nSo the president is talking about sealing the border the president's talked about sending the military to seal the border\nAre talking about threatening to cancel a U.S payments including humanitarian aid to these countries like Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador\n[noise] you know the stats that we have the U.S border agents have arrested sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight at the border in just the last well\nJust September you know like last month over six teen and a half thousand to arrest that is the highest one mom total on record oh they clearly doing their job\nThat shows in eighty percent increase in the number of illegal aliens illegal immigrant families trying to cross our border\nSince Trump ended the policy of separating parents from their minor children\nSo it's climbing higher so the policy and I never thought the separation of the kids was a good idea and the administration even said not a good idea of the Trump kids have said yeah that wasn't a good idea millennia said not a good idea\nPresident Trump has acknowledged that that was it a good idea I tell you what though I and others I don't support that I think that you want to keep them together but let them know you're not getting into the United states\nBut I Can't look the other way deny the fact that once the policy was officially ended here we have the numbers skyrocketing the number of ended at sixteen thousand six hundred fifty a busted\nBy immigration officials here us I'm above you know bordering customs are agents\nSixteen thousand six hundred and fifty interests in September and of course that's after the policy was ended so it wasn't that policy obviously kept a little more away now they're saying oh let's we're not going to get separate let's go let's give it a shot\nThat was going on here and listen this is not a good situation but it is a fight that President Trump likes and yeah this is being used as a rallying cry and this is a total based gender upper\nArea it's a general it sounds like a suffering doesn't it hey you want to generate rubber so or maybe it's a ... maybe it's a stimulant it's such a great drug gender upper ah but not this this is again the Trump position which is the correct position will also help the juice up\nThe base I as we head into the midterm elections here\nAnd President Trump has been advising Republicans to make immigration a key election issue and it should be\nAnd he blames Democrats entirely for existing border problems you know Republicans have been a as you know ridiculously gun shy due to the fallout from\nThe zero tolerance policy that produced you know all that video on this sob stories of the little kids living in barracks without their parents behind fences and again\nYou know we're getting that same\nNarrative it's it's like a pamphlet was being handed out on what to say what the claim oh drug gangs are threatening my family and me and if my kids don't join they're going to kill them they're going to kill me we got to come to America you know it's the same narrative ... their own reading virtually the same script\nHad eight hundred three eight zero one eighty
