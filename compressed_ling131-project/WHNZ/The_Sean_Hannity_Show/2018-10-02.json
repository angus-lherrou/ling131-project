NBC's report on MSNBC this is Kate Snow Kate Snow national correspondent for NBC News and she anchors are one of the weekend shows I think the Sunday NBC nightly news ah from New York\nAnd she had to sit down with this Julie sweating ... who ah apparently the FBI bucket even mess with sweat and that guy yes [laughter] I mean each some Democrats have asked for the interview her but you know we know that the FBI is interviewed for we'll get to that and just a bit here but the sweat Nick ... has massive credibility problems now\nNBC News they play an excerpt of the interview during the NBC nightly news or a portion of what ran a longer interview on MSNBC the deal is though is that millions of more people will watch the NBC nightly news\nInterview and that package that clip on the NBC television network them a watch on MSNBC on cable\nSo while they might have asked some questions or had some disclaimer is on MSNBC they didn't do the same with the clip the theme ran\nOn the NBC nightly news last night first of all my question for NBC News is why the hell would you give the sweat and make the time of day anyway\nYou have other mainstream outlets that I think that this woman is squarely she has a host of legal issues\nA restraining order from an ex she's been accused of defamation I mean she's had a bunch of legal issues\nApparently and a lot of other outlets are staying away from this uh this woman uh CNN and they had a avid Audi on a\n... to discuss the issues that I if I have time I'll get into that but ah before I go to phones here from the NBC story you know she was backing away\nShe's she's she's not backing away from some of the claims she initially made\nWhen ... first came out with that big reveal of this new third individual accusing Brett Kavanaugh and she's she's backed off of some of these claims so NBC News Kate Snow they said they couldn't be sure\nThat they reported that that this sweating it couldn't be sure that Kavanaugh was one of the boys who assaulted during a party in the Nineteen eighties so that that's a back\nHey how's it going I'm old well I have a\nCouple of points I'd like to make about Christine Ford um my theory is that that for her this was like get rich quick schemes because\nShe likes to travel we know that uh she lied about her fear of flying and she likes to fly all over the world and go on vacation and all this kind of stuff\nI'm like ...\nOne of the reasons I Believe that if because she was on the verge seemingly of crying I'm through the entire testimony with her little mousy\nAnd\nShe I Am I the way I talked about the voice last week and the vocal fry that can the card Daschle in ... which I\nI mean I think we were all shocked last week when we heard open her mouth go ahead sorry\nSo she did not have one tier string down her cheek through the entire testimony what five hours or something like that\nAnd ... and I think\nShe stands to make a heck of a lot of money and her uh go funny is up you know over seven hundred thousand dollars\nYeah I stop loss and when I when I heard it was over seven hundred grand I stop loving listen there were some times where she did get emotional you're suggesting it's a

got flake of Arizona now or none of them are facing re election this year and of course flake he's a exited the process he's leaving\nYou've got to Democrats no ... this is what's important here is you have two Democrats\nWho are in red states that are trying to keep their seats and those two Democrats are Heidi Heitkamp she's from North Dakota and you have Joe mansion\nThe third of West Virginia so how how how are they going to vote when ultimately there in red states\nAnd they're trying to get reelected and how would it be perceived by a their electric if they vote against Kavanaugh so there's a lot of interesting phase is at play here are regarding the president if you're just tuning in there's a New York times\nBull last piece the New York times I just smack in the president in the last couple of hours the New York times out with a piece\nClaiming that the Trump has misled for years about how we made all his money that the ah the Trump but companies have engaged in tax fraud and especially in the state of his father the New York times I mean really just mastery\nGoing after the president\n[noise] ah there's you know obviously no why shocker here are the New York times has consistently you know an attack this president ah you know some of the details I read some of the New York times piece last hour\nAnd you know I asked ... where the hell did all this documentation come from well are you\nThere is plenty that we don't know exactly but this is what they do say the New York times says the investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records bank statements financial and its accounting ledgers cash disbursement reports invoices and cancelled checks\nMost notably the documents include more than two hundred tax returns from Fred Trump\nHis company's the various Trump partnerships in front while the records do not include the president's personal tax returns and reveal a little about his resume business dealings at home and abroad\nDozens of corporate partnership and trust tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises\nAnd it says what emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the forty fifth president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr Trump's sold in his book says TV shows and his political life so the New York times here they're they're calling Trump an absolute liar\nThey're saying I Am back to the story and Mr Trump's version of how he got rich he was a master dealmaker who broke free of his father's tiny outer barrel operation and parlayed a single million dollar loan from his father\nAnd then in parentheses quote I had to pay him back with interest into a ten billion dollar empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels high rises I casinos airlines golf course of the world over in Mr Trump's version it was always his godson gumption that overcame setbacks\nFred Trump was simply a cheerleader\nSo their claim here is that Trump has vastly under sold the financial kick start that he'd gotten from his father\n[noise] and then of course there's the allegations of all kinds of tax fraud and wheeling and dealing on his parents his state which they received a billion dollars from and if they at least that allegedly shorted the governments are\nOf the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes with the New York times alleging a Trump tax skiing back in the Nineteen nineties\nThere are also reports that based on the New York times reporting here\nCNBC is now reporting that the New York State Department of revenue that they are now looking into the allegations made\nBy the New York times in this piece and again ah you know don't forget when it comes to tax fraud there's no statute of limitations that I don't know how to states work but with the IRS if there's fraud\n\nThem you know the whole all you don't need to keep your tax returns past seven years and then I heard in recent years if you know for years uh but if there's fraud or that they can't go back\nA that's a you know the statute of limitations et cetera but again that is out the window if the IRS can show fraud they can go back\nAs far as they freaking want an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine question for you\nWhy would I be playing this
