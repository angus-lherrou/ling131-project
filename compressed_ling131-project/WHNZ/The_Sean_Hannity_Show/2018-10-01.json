I Can't take me seriously because he flat out blatantly lied for years about his Vietnam service\nAt the fact is that he talked about his time in Vietnam in combat and he said he was not in Vietnam in combat so this guy the people of Connecticut put a lawyer\nI mean a stolen valor a story essentially put this guy in the U.S Senate a ... from Connecticut I mean if it's just it's unfathomable to me\nAnd I again I I brought Blumenthal backup\nOr last week on Thursday when we had this uh this new round of ah you know special ... with a Ford and Ann Cavanaugh and again Richard Blumenthal in his his high and mighty ah Mr pious\nAnd I I I Can't take seriously I mean the people of Connecticut how the hell can you take Blumenthal serious one and then a Trump tweeted about this over the weekend I think it was yesterday\nI think it was on was a Saturday Night or Sunday Morning I saw a tweet from President Trump when he calls that a Blumenthal writes so we're still trying to figure out who is the booze or Trump suggesting that there are some of those pretty bad shape\nA Democrat on the other side was referring to the Senate Judiciary committee or or is it just a general democratic senator\nOr outside of the committee so we have Mazie Hirono from Hawaii Cory Booker from New Jersey and ah ... Harris from California and so those are the current members\nOf the Senate Judiciary committee to ten members on the Democratic side so [noise]\n\nOr is Trump sending them out of wild goose

Dr Ford because from the very beginning enlisted if I've got time I can go back and and read you the Barney Frank a press release you know Barney Frank from um\nUm oh not part what party Frank I'm Bernice [laughter] hey Barney\nCan I get you to weigh in on this point I'd like to see Barney Frank way on this a Bernie [laughter] that's a Good Friday and flip a a Bernie Sanders I ... I can read you the the Bernie Sanders\nPress release from I think it's July nine for ...

there's no way that he would allow for a sham investigation I said this last week\nThat as far as mobilizing you've got a a dozens of dozens and dozens of FBI field offices and that I said last week the trust me Christopher Wray is going to be personally\nOn top of this with this top deputies of the FBI to get this thing going and I don't think it's going to be a sham it's not going to be a half assed investigation they've gotten resources to get a lot done in a week would it be nicer to have more than a week of course but the Democrats agreed to await let's do a week\nTo see what they uncovered and certainly they have the resources they have the the ... the the field agents to conduct these investigations this is what they do and I don't think for a moment\nThe Democrats that are complaining or those that don't like Trump don't like this administration suggesting that this is going to be just a a sham\nOf an investigation and it's just going to be a a a quick little sign off and it's going to be cursory I don't think the Christopher raised will allow that his integrity issues would dictate that\nAnd the fact that people speak very highly of Christopher Wray and that it

have the breaking news from earlier today\n[noise] that and I would I I I have the the print out here from various sources that the Trump Administration has given the FBI so essentially told the director re\nThat the Trump Administration according to reports is letting the FBI expand the Kavanaugh probe and Trump said as much or during the press today from saying hey listen left the FBI go where they want to go\nI don't think there's any behind the scenes wink and a nod no I don't think Christopher Wray would want any part of that or be any part of that or allow his agency to be manipulated in that fashion so the indications here are that President Trump\nAnd the White House is saying as much now the last couple of hours that they are allowing and authorizing the FBI to expand\nThe Kavanaugh investigation\nA witch means interviewing more people now I Know the Democrats so ... what is the number twenty four what does this worn out from earlier today that the Democrats are handed over\nAbout twenty four yeah I just wanted to compromise is that that that the Democrats wanted a and they handed over a list of twenty four individuals they want the FBI to investigate\nAnd of course by tomorrow or you can add a hundred to that I'm sure if the Democrats are going to want a hundred and twenty four best and then the next day it'll be two twenty four if it doesn't scare me\nI Know the score I get it I Know that the Democrats are trying to just delayed the label a run out the clock hopefully when the mid term elections in the house but more importantly the Senate since this is you know a a confirmation as under the Senate purview obviously and they would love to stop Trump dead in his tracks\nThe house I'm scared of the house could no Democrat and that that oh my God but the Senate if that's a tougher climate but it's not out of the question\nAnd then you want to talk about just nasty despicable payback against Trump or it it would be it would be on but it'd be like nothing we've ever seen where a president in power and his party or not faring well in the midterms are not historically it's happened as we know\nBought a if this happened now oh Mike ... it's going to be or whatever you think it is exponentially Jack it up by a hundred\nI grab recalls here in a second but just the expanding on this uh expanded Kavanaugh parole that the Trump Administration has told the FBI have added investigate whoever and whatever you want the agreement was get it done in a week\nAnd of course we know what's going to happen to the Democrats are going to start belly aching or any time now oh we started off with the two weeks off with a three and let's get it done in a week a lot can be done in a week\nSo the New York times earlier today reported that the Trump Administration is going to allow the FBI to go where they want to go investigate and interview who they want to they think is necessary\nIn order to him is timeframe\nInvestigates and the allegations against capital and\nYou know with the White House I agree the concessions well the White House then on friday 'cause the investigations supposed to be wrapped up by friday will the White House then on friday say okay we're going to give the FBI another week or maybe another three four days it'll it has to be concluded by Tuesday or Wednesday is that a possibility\nWell and the fact that the White House and the New York times is reporting that the White House has agreed to let the FBI go where they want to go\nAnd that Trump signed off on this I mean that shows All right either concessions so yeah it and will they conceded allow a little more time with the FBI at the end of the week\nWho knows a you know you don't McConnell is saying there's going to be a vote this week\nSo that means when I'm at the FBI I I don't\nThat happens at the FBI investigation concludes by a CEO will be on a friday\nOr cause a business on ... I don't know how you have a vote or\nOn friday I mean maybe I again will this be that special Saturday session that McConnell told the Senate or a ... staffers and senators to plan for last weekend maybe they'll maybe they'll ah begin debate and open it up on on Saturday\nMaybe they'll work work all weekend so [noise] ah they have it that's the latest\nOne eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on Smith back to the phones let's grab Thomas is in snow mass village in Colorado hello Thomas Iran Schmidt\nThank God I Love your ... your scorcher scorched earth mentioned a it was and I'm just I'm just amazed that Dr Ford has been scraping Deuce scrutiny I mean when she got up there she lost me to the minute she started reading from a script that she was terrified\nI mean it just that didn't that didn't that didn't wash with me\nShe should've worked right into the uh the audience the senators and then she spoke like a traumatized child with the development yes she is a college professor yeah\nI mean I'm sure she was coached to be able to do it just happened last week\nBut I I Am just I'm just not buying it at all I Know I I think she was traumatized yes but how does she gets her how she\nGot homicide ...
