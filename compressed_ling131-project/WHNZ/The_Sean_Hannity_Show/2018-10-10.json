tower\nWas toppled or a thousand foot radio tower has come down and we're also hearing that most of the I Am and FM stations in Panama City or off the air right now\nThat would not surprise me remembering Hurricane Andrew came across South Florida back in Ninety two how many uh television or radio towers came down and those kind of wins that and and there was one fifty five one sixty one sixty five so you're in that neighborhood so I I'm not surprised that the towers were to come down\nA dentist one are you hearing as far as from people on the ground or water you gathering information

to get a hurricane\nA full blown hurricane ah with all the impacts about wind and rain a going with it\nA dentist what area are we talking about dust ah we're talking about what areas in southern

... which still a category for when does it we can and will it ... it will it quickly weaken\nIt ... it will spend down but they're remember the storm is so strong it's going to take a while for the

strength as it gets into South Carolina tomorrow\nI saw that as I Know we've got a role here but I Would imagine that a hurricane of this nature a category to potentially hitting a well inland and

August in Nineteen Ninety two west\nOf ... space which was ground zero or\nAnybody that stays in one of the things I mean we build up pretty significantly down here the to accommodate the the when that we get we we're we're we're very frequented by by her ... um unfortunately nobody else in the country builds the way we do\nUm we use all concrete walls a matter of fact that's how I built was the concrete group as well I'm In I feel badly\nAnybody that would have stayed in this area I Know they're going through right now I've seen a witness it myself this is a bad storm anybody this end of what\nA what brain building or art or for God's sake to a trailer they're done with a thing as a pet store\nYeah the only thing that we can hope for now is that the most importantly that the loss of life is Neal or minimal or hopefully none\nBut with a category for a strong one at that almost a category five\nUh luckily hitting a little less of a populated area but again the breath the width of this storm is so large I'm just hoping that the injury and death toll is extremely low but I I understand what you say about structures you know as a Florida resident myself you know I've been in Florida since Nineteen Ninety two\nA roofing materials just seeing plywood and two by fours and and a looming aluminum garnering all over the place and again a lots of materials and debris in the water\nAnd we're seeing some of the some of the uh as far as the storm surge and again some of the purchase of nine to Thirteen feet or in some of the images I'm seeing every bit of that because we're seeing water\nOr up to the rules of houses water up I mean extreme severe flooding with the storm surge in Mexico beach or Florida\nOr so again I I'm just hoping that we're not going to be dealing with the heavy death toll the damage toll is going to be high folks I'm just hoping that again the storm surge is a killer it will drown you water is like a wall of concrete coming at you\nAnd an amazing speed and people say oh I'll I'll be a folks water will hit you like a ton of bricks\n\nListen folks now it'll flash flooding I mean you know unless they're out in a for instance those that are out of the desert or the desert southwest\nYou know those that are you are listening in Las Vegas right now when you when your head outside of Vegas you know you you guys have seen even in Vegas ... some years ago the flash flooding that occurred there\nAnd the cars being swept off the roads and as you drive through the desert areas you'll you'll see some of the run all the areas where you have the flood zones you'll see the flood warnings and you'll see you know where where water can come in from the hills and and just completely annihilate\nAnd that's always a dangerous I think folks hopefully have grass on the dangers of water now the other big story today is is Wall Street getting hammered\nOr the Dow fell even more uh we shot or our number one down about two minutes before the top of the hour or we are left with about a minute and a half left in the trading day\nOn Wall street and uh the numbers folks are they ain't pretty awful day on Wall street folks of the total so we have s impede down Ninety five points the Dow Jones industrial average down ... eight hundred and thirty one points\nAnd the NASDAQ down a looks like it's going to settle on two Seventy\nNine I'm Sorry three Fifteen\nSo a a doubt down a thirty one the NASDAQ down three Fifteen and the S. and P. down Ninety four point sixty six almost Ninety five so awful day\nWall Street and and what caused that storm well that's a pretty much you know tech stocks getting hammered the fears of rising interest rates\nAnd uh we're essentially in a decline now this is the biggest the climb in a well he's got to be what six months or so uh I think the last thing decline that we we saw I think you have to go back to march\nOr so in a way but on the stock market role here\nAnd uh we're we're looking at some numbers\nThat certainly are are giving a traders and investors and and four one K. holders a little bit of a little kitten their stomach today\nBut the wall Street Journal reporting a biggest decline in more than six months yeah they're six months investors accelerated their retreat from fast growing technology stocks\nA major indexes have started the fourth quarter on their weakest footing since the beginning of twenty sixteen\nOh is this just a little speed bump folks or is this indicative of\nThe stock market fears that the certainly exist or are there the eyes being a you know opened up in October just because October\nUh is the month where we've seen the obviously the the most carnage on Wall street\nOr you know going back to the crash in twenty nine and in Nineteen eighty seven so I was ... October is certainly a month that that has a you know people always looking over their shoulders and October is not off to a great start here so uh I don't look at your four one K. today\nBecause you get to see the Dow down eight thirty one the NASDAQ down three Fifteen and we asked them pay down Ninety five point to sell reflected\nA once\nIn a ... with a OSU my executive producer wants to know a\nA ... could investors have put the hits the fed off until after the hurricane oh I I don't think so I just hope this is not an indication of an extremely rough\nOctober I Know there have been multiple stories out there that the fears of a of massive correction of the fears of a crash a or a implanted and in some of the big wall street pros and experts a lesson ups and downs or you know healthy\nAnd you know pull backs are natural and listen suddenly a you know people's eyes are open up here but the market has been on one hell of a role obviously uh I just hope that we're not dealing with with the beginnings of a nasty brutal October\nAs the month is known for nasty brutal months eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine again Amazon clocks\nAny resigned Gordon bird it's the most powerful hurricane to strike the Florida Panhandle in recorded history and it's moving fast the national Hurricane Center says Michael is still a category for\nThe ... between Panama City in Tallahassee after landfall this afternoon Terry Vega rode out Michael I Do still run you Michael in Panama City beach\nOut what the category carry that actually act so far we have a little eerie now that it's a foreigner among\nMany people weren't able to evacuate Panama City because of the store moved in so quickly local congressman Neil done kept dealt with by the county emergency management\nServices category ... storm it very strong or out of just a minimal poor and it's got a company but the biggest search but anybody in this part of the state has ever seen in history\nSeven feet reporting in Napa electrical is so far there's a tornado watch when north Florida counties used to be Appalachia cooler river until two am tomorrow eastern time utility crews from all over the state or standing by to start restoring electric service and a Gibbs is with Duke Energy\nBecause of the size of the storm and how strong it is we really had a they each hour crude and resources because they bring it meant and all types of materials that we had to be sure that we kept them far enough from the storm so that they weren't in any way in the path that struck\nMore than one hundred twenty thousand people without electricity in the Gulf Power service area alone dozens of Red Cross volunteers are hunkered down in Tallahassee waiting for the chance to help when the storm passes Sharon Taylor is executive director of the American Red Cross has a chapter she says there are about five hundred more people waiting for the chance to move in from out of town\nHad had been staged and Orlando because as you know our share porch closed in area and we weren't able to bring him in years today\nI mean here's candidate fake ...\nTyler also says they plan to help people who may be homeless when hurricane shelters close in a few days with the news on the Florida news network I'm Gordon bird\n... from the underground command post mark Levin is on twelve fifty W H in the week nights seven to ten\nSo you're talking about climate today and what what's going on with this this hurricane and it's just nasty some of the video that is beginning to come in\nYou know it's sort of a parallel here 'cause we're dealing with when you're dealing with the climate and the hurricanes of her here in the United states they'd been happening since the beginning of time folks\nAnd yet this on record to be the strongest hurricane to hit the panhandle\nUh or at least since Eighteen fifty one but I'm pretty confident that prior to records being kept there have been many many years ago centuries ago hurricanes\nAs strong or stronger that have hit the coast because they've always been around\nHurricanes have always been a threat to the obvious areas in psych loans and and typhoons et cetera so the obvious areas on the planet but you know it's it you know we're talking about the climate to at least and the hurricane activity but also we have this political climate we have\nTorrential rain and wins in our political climate and\nSaw for instance a Rand Paul Rand Paul has said that in this political climate or somebody may get killed\nAnd I don't think Rand Paul is that far off let's look at the damages or his nut job neighbor did them so I Want to get into that\nIn just a bit but as far as the political climate\nAnd the fact that Democrats are vying they're making every possible uh attempt to take back the house of representatives and to make inroads or there is a pipe dream that the Democrats are hoping to take back\nThe Senate and of course was in the house in the Senate in the hands of the Democrats would certainly cripple a good deal of what President Trump wants to accomplish all as a good thing\nJust in case that he's gotten a lot of cup was including two Supreme Court nominations\nBy talking and speaking of the political climate that exist right now\nAnd I told you about President Trump or just a few minutes ago I I told you about his tweet that he is going to keep going to Pennsylvania for a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania you're a area tonight\nOr as to as he pointed not disappoint the thousands of people that are already there and the thousands of people that will be coming\nBut the political climate\nWhen you look toward the U.S Senate\nOr there's something very important that we need to attach to this current hurricane\nAnd that is that there is a a a democratic seat in the Senate which is held by Senator Bill Nelson now\nAnd Bill Nelson is being challenged by the Florida governor Rick Scott now Rick Scott obviously leading up to this hurricane and in the aftermath\nHas been very visible he will be very visible he is in the past gotten very good marks or for some of the natural disasters in tropical activity and hurricane to the state of Florida during his a two term tenure as Florida governor however let me be very clear here\nWhat could make or break a governor Rick Scott and his quest\nTo take this scene away from the Democrat Bill Nelson in Florida for the U.S Senate or is going to be I think viewed through the lens of how the aftermath of this hurricane goes listen we're we're a month shy here of the midterm elections\nWe're right around a month shy so Rick Scott as governor of Florida is going to be judged and he's going to be put under an extreme microscope right now and this could be the make or break\nSo the way the state of Florida under the direction of Governor Scott handles the aftermath of this hurricane I think is going to have an amazing impact\nOn weather and the polling has been a pretty close to ... do we what's the latest a a real clear politics average getting giving the latest on the uh Bill Nelson and the Rick Scott race\nSo I I feel the youngest is trying to you know how Milan ... here in the sense that uh you know you're going to be accused of not standing with women women so if an accusation is made\nYou just take that accusation that one hundred percent face value with out any type of proof\n'cause I Want any molester I Want any sexual assault prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nBut again speaking of climate again you know here in this tough political climate and we know that it was already talked about to stop cabin on all costs\nAnd then we have this this uh this waterfall of accusations that come out and and a bunch of unsubstantiated claims\nOf course you need proof that's only fair that is that there's proof\nI thought the millennia hit the nail on the head I think I'm a lawyer Trump made a whole lot of sense so much sense that it's hard to figure out how anyone including the Democrats could argue any differently yes ah people should be heard\nWhat if you make the accusation there needs to be some proof\nNow there have been some high profile claims in the past that we're we're totally false if you look at the the uh the University of North Carolina lacrosse a story member of that\nOne propelled that embassy fill a Al Sharpton to prominence the to wanna Brawley story of the accusation made and completely false it was a total fabrication never happen\nNow of course there are many more examples of where things did happen and women were abused but you also have some of these high profile cases where it was complete fabrication and then there were lives\nSo I just don't know how you can be upset with the ...\nThe lady ah in saying\nThat hey you I Want to list all accusers year but you you need to have some proof\n\nI I think she was spot on but you've got the first lady here coming under attack are you do that to me because sometimes\nI mean she's making a ton of sense and you can't go too far so unless there's a little more to this I don't want to play when we have more time hanging on more snow [noise]\nTalk attrition tomorrow morning nine to eleven twelve fifty seven ... [noise]\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my down I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I
