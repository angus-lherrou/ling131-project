{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "\nI always one of the\n... I mean people people take a multivitamin a regular\nBasis or you know throughout the year but I think some of the most in you know the most important time to take it to make sure your cake and is during the winter season it's colder we talked about there's more stress around the holiday season\nUm and just you know you want to keep your nutrient levels much higher the other thing too is especially when we talk about cold and flu season you know the people that are most affected are very very young children babies and also the elderly\nAnd and it brings up an interesting topic and I'm like come back on the show next time we can really expand on it but I just wanted to touch on it quick at something called and you know since then\n[laughter] you know ... is basically the aging\nOf the immune system so as we get older our immune system gets older\nAnd its ability to to fight disease to you know I'm you know prevent chronic disease is a is not as strong as you know your immune system is just getting weaker is just getting older you are\nSo multi vitamin a good multi vitamin D is really important in that it keeps a lot of that good nutrition that you need and your body the vitamins and minerals the coach factors are they're going to help you keep your immune system strong also uh you know part of the you know since this is an increasing inflammatory issues as well\nSo that's a that's a key factor in a you know the elder very is a a fantastic product in um helping specifically you know with microbes but you know your immune system need of nutrition to stay healthy you need a lot of oxygen\nAnd so a new chapter make theories a multi\nVitamin a lot of great multi vitamin D on market for that will be the other thing I think it's important for a for people to consider when it comes to you know how do I best provide nutrition to my body during the cold and flu season [noise]\nYeah what are the funny or Andrew mentions this but I talked about this just the other day and you know it's in essence a that's the gradual [noise] deterioration of the immune system\nAging is a risk factor is just the way it is but also um you know you can you can age that immune system or\nBy other things and not just aging itself\nThe way you live diet lifestyle too much stress not enough sleep unrest improper nutrition\nOr it goes on any number of any number of risk factors why that can bring on the decline of gradual deterioration of the immune system um\nAnd and you know ... that that if you apply the host meaning you and me are inability to respond to these microbial threats these are the causes infections and the disease\nUm and it's it's especially difficult for the elderly during cold and flu season because and you notice a lot of elderly get respiratory ailments and illnesses during cold and flu season that's a weak spot\nMany of these viruses and bacteria will target the respiratory system\nSo your immune system is compromised or if you're into a phase of him you know in essence in your life well you know you need all the help you can get to go to Peoria, Illinois or talk to Gloria Hi Gloria how are you today\n[noise] [laughter]

right now yeah [laughter] when does it start when does that winter start to set it up there\nAnd I have no feet around the end of October won't be long may mid November\nYeah won't it won't be long but yeah it's\nNot the cold weather that necessarily makes people sick it's the cold weather driving people indoors in close contact with other people\n... yeah that's the thing that that gets them to me that that yeah\nAnd of course cold weather can be stressful as well uh on people and the far already immune suppressed that doesn't help matters but congratulations you want to twenty five dollars

Florida governor Rick Scott trying to get his state ready for the arrival of hurricane Michael which is already kicking up the surf and is still about a day away from landfall somewhere on the panhandle\nWell I really don't I mean the difference here is is that it's gonna make landfall in about twenty four hours and right now it's in a it's an intensification stage\nSo even if nothing happened and made landfall as a hundred and ten mile an hour hurricane that's still a pretty big deal I'm you know I I I Would think there's a higher chance of it being a three or four that is one or two but you know we've learned over the years the intensity forecasting is not perfect\nAnd I think regardless of the cat and number two three four it's going to be a really big deal for the pan handle potentially catastrophic and if you're familiar with kind of the vegetation up in that part of the state it's a lot different than it is here in Tampa Bay is just a lot more trees\nA it's a different climate and there's going to be just widespread\nOutages that could last days weeks maybe a month or so in some places and then it's not just to be a coastal for the thing is going to move into Georgia and the Carolinas and bring some wind issues and power outages this was not going to be just the state of Florida storm it'll continue moving northeast up towards North Carolina\nI'm Paul I know you're in a tight schedule doing whether graphics for your for five and six PM a cast a storm surge now if you could let let's direct this directly in my listeners that are on the the the Florida Gulf Coast in the pan handle the Panama City listeners those to the east those or to the west\nOr let's talk storm surge predictors are potentially eight to twelve feet of storm surge and of course that can be deadly\nYeah and that's always an eight to twelve feet ... Indian past his to cedar key um even here even here we've had we've had high water around Tampa Bay and has been some flooding\nAre way down towards Naples or what some high water you get to think of of the Gulf of Mexico as being like a big ...\nBecause it's almost close to close circle and that water when it began splashing along our coast really piles up it's a whole different set up here on the Gulf of Mexico there it is on the Atlantic side when the water is deeper into the water off the coast of the panhandle in off our west coast is pretty shallow\nAnd it really piles up quickly so on our west coast storm surge\nIs the big problem up in the big band and the panhandle storm surge it's wind and it's and it's rained so that's that's how that's\nGoing to play out yeah I saw in the Tampa Bay area which is my back yard 'cause my home is you know is right on Tampa Bay a two to four feet I I I don't know if we'll see much really that will affect us but\nI you know I I just I feel for the people in the panhandle right now if you want to do as as a a well trained a meteorologist who's dealt with the hurricane activity for decades Paul what do you say to my listeners that are in this path\nOr to the east and west the Panama City beach\nOr the water always wins don't don't ever try to fight the water because the water will end up in places you never think the water is going to go if you're told to evacuate\nGet out I mean there's always the chance and it happens a lot that you can leave and the next day he says I probably should've stayed but trust me it's it's not worth\nA try to ride out a storm on the coast especially a storm of this magnitude if your soul to leave just find someplace away from a water again you're evacuating from water you're not evacuating from when\nYou got to get away from the water the only time you evacuated from wind is if you live in a mobile home and there's a chance to your mobile home to be compromised you've just gotta get away from the water the water by far is the number one killer when it comes\nTo hurricanes and Paul last thing here I'm timeline we're looking at about this time tomorrow\nYeah to get badly tonight and then tomorrow make landfall ah and then it'll move inland but it's not going to be just a quick deal it's going to the impacts are going to be far ranging and we'll be doing stories of storm damage in Georgia South Carolina in North Carolina but obviously\nA it'll be worse where the storm does make landfall and you know Panama City beach is pretty built up now there's a lot of lot of stuff up there that wasn't there ten Fifteen Years ago and and a lot of stuff literally sits on the Gulf of Mexico\nI've driven right by so I've seen all the buildings on the construction on the high rises though the motel the hotels and and the condo so I'm driven right along the road there right adjacent to the beach and uh if we can call this a lighter note did you see\nThat the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office issued a trespass warning to a gym can't tour of the\nWeather I I saw that tweet that's kind of funny or you know they yeah he's yeah well\nHe does a great job and and you know the thing is you know you when he when he shows up your your town you know the stuff's getting real\nYeah and and that's the point is it's it's ingested was more of a a joke from the Santa Rosa accounting for the sheriff's office they don't want Jim Kent Tony their nose when Jim shows up it's it's going to be banned typically\nCome down in the summer just don't come down in September and October\n... that's that's what they said Paul Paul ... chief meteorologist Fox Thirteen and Tampa Bay Florida Paula thanks we'll talk to you soon\nOK buddy ... thanks\nSo there we haven't uh again I Want to take this time out on my national program\nAnd also let's keep in mind that a lot of the oil platforms have a shutdown and evacuated in the Gulf of Mexico so you're saying you know if you're in Las Vegas our why does this concern me or if you're up in the Pacific northwest you know why or or Minnesota why why should I care about this well one of the reasons\nIs this does have the potential to push up\nA gas prices because you've had a whole series of the oil and gas natural gas and oil producing platforms\nIn the Gulf of Mexico I have been evacuated so a lot of\nThe production staff have been taken off of these platforms in production has been shut down\nAnd over the years we've seen that that has had an effect on oil prices which in turn will ah Jack up the prices at the pump\nAnd of course we know that if the market looks for any reason to raise prices whether it's a Texas crude whether it's the you know a gasoline futures whatever\nI'm sure the the prices are already rising it at the pump so that's why the whole country you know needs to be aware that it's not just you know the impact of the storm itself but there is an economic impact in many cases\nFor the whole country when we have these storms because of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico so again or to my floor to listeners\nOn the the the northern ah a part of the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida Panhandle please heed all warnings were going to follow this we have a lot of ground to cover today or next I Want to get into Nikki Haley so why did Nikki Haley\nResigned as you know if you're a regular listener I\nA a great affection for Nikki Haley I I thought she did a wonderful job is to South Carolina governor I've got a lot of friends in the low country and and uh and upstate in in South Carolina and everyone I Know really love Nikki Haley I and\nAs UN ambassador she's done a fantastic job again uh another thing that Trump is done right is\nIs you know announcing pretty seriously have is a new sheriff in town here and we the United states we're not going to get beaten up any longer by the United nations and the bulk of the countries in the UN that that hate us\nOr it's America first I had no issue with that that's not code for anything America ... at first than white supremacy you know someone's going to say America First that's that's code for white supremacy that is that's BS\nI don't care what color you are I don't care what religion you are I don't care what floats your boat in this country if you're an American citizen you oughta want America First and this country first so why did Nikki Haley\nAnnounced her resignation or for the end of the year here or there is some speculation and well let's drill end will also grab your phone calls coming up on ... if you want to get an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine a just a little more on that trust password Jim can't tore of course when the weather channel\nAnd again the\nReading here from the police in Santa Rosa County Florida is yeah of Jim can't tore it showing up well that means we'd probably have a bad hurricane so let's give them a press pass warning so he doesn't come here and therefore maybe the hurricane won't you know it's it's more ingest obviously that's gonna have no effect on the path of the hurricane\nBut from when I get this this is from\nAh ah to P. N. J. dot com and the and the Florida Panhandle the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office has a playful message for the weather channel Jim can't tore stay away from a year\nAs the panhandle braces for a serious storm and hurricane Michael the law enforcement agency took a friendly jab at the meteorologist they actually did a poster like a wanted poster or with the press past warning and a push and they pushed\nSat on their Facebook page to issue a fake trespass warning began touring\nComplete with photos and physical description of the weatherman identify kids' toys a person of interest\nAnd adds up the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office in Florida\nWould prefer he make non business related visits only and winter months preferred so you know even at a time where there's a lot of seriousness\nYeah there's a little bit of liberty here All right let's get him to Nikki Haley we've got all your President Trump today and Nikki Haley and we'll get to that coming up in minutes Iran Schmidt\nOur sponsor their salary launching it is light scream dot com and listen I\nLike to entertain on the show I like to inform I also want to help people and some of our sponsors you do a wonderful job in helping you specifically here light stream it's a way for you to reduce how much interest you pay on your credit card debt\nIt is really out of control the average interest rate the average interest rate on credit card debt\nIs over Eighteen percent a PR I mean it's a noxious\nSo if you've got credit card debt why are you flushing additional money down the toilet by paying interest that is way too hard or too high on your credit card so if you've got one to four or five course whatever you can get a credit card consolidation loan from light scream\nFrom five point eight nine percent a PR with auto paint that's what they offer like trained by the way as a division of sun trust bank a real deal back you know well known in the southeast up\nAnd we'll help you nationwide get along from five thousand to a hundred thousand you can even get your funds as soon as the day you apply\nMy listeners will also get a special discounts on top of light streams already low rates the only way to get the discount is going to light streamed dot com slash T.

reside just the numbers that I think they treated with respect he had a great meeting with North Korea and\nChina and there was didn't do much job I guess he was giving them a message and they were giving him a message to come back to them in\nMany of them I\nDon't know it is a you know I don't have any of the authors of the Saudi disappeared\n[noise] didn't hear\nThe question was president ah

heading out I I thought that I heard and I made a note I got to find my note a yes or purpose counting that there's a a big announcement coming tonight\nAnd he made that that ... earlier today so I don't know and I I thought he might be heading to Iowa or he's having some are more of these uh you know campaign stops you know helping candidates with the uh the midterm elections so\nWhat does this big announcement that's coming you still are taking questions\nBack there were those the day you do that and the air is cleaner I agree with that but they do you go well beyond just made you go to Wal Mart and the air is actually leaders\nAre\nMeeting you're asking questions you can't get to hear\n\nThe question but what was the answer and try to figure it out or so where where do you say you've got to the Iowa\nA is heading Council Bluffs or to the president is heading to counsel bald guy what tonight that's where he's headed right now and\nRight okay so the question here is about the the the ban on summers sales ... Fifteen Years Rawabi if at all you know I guess what they're talking about anyway so the\nPresident of town an earlier today big announcement coming in Iowa tonight the walk at that big it up with the\nNow as far as ... already because you're at a bucket truck that was also before we were able to listen in on the president or because the president this or this tape started rolling on the networks I before we started our number two\nAnd the president was asked about\nA buck a proper apparently or or Jared or because apparently he did say that is a ball go would make a great US ambassador to the United nations or by I Believe that he brought up\nA you know any you know some some nepotism issues that of course it'd be a cute yeah I don't think the optics would be great even you know Jared Kushner\nWho for whatever reason Nikki Haley\n... what did he praised Jared Kushner was that unilateral or was there some discussion that hey good to give a ... a nice little uh embrace on the way out I I don't know\nI'm not quite sure what the detail is there but let's listen to some of Nikki Haley or at the White House ah Oval Office spray where it was officially now that she was leaving\n[noise] well I Want to say on first of all I Want to thank the lord just you know allowing us to come out and not be that way and it has been an honor in a lifetime I you know I that I Am such a lucky\nThat when I were to leave this date that raised me and give them a country on line so very much has really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that matter most excited won't get the two\nYears your cat what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states if we're countries may not like what we do but they were that's what we\nDo they know that if we think we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons are sharing that whether it was NATO hanged and other countries have to pay their share I mean whether the trade deal which has been amazing they get the department means that ... and they followed\nThrough with that but then if you look at just the two years at the last one\nPoint green billion and the un by we've made it stronger we made it more [laughter]\nIs out today and we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green North Korean sanctions on land packages which we're the largest and generation down in a way that we can really work towards denuclearizing North Korea\nOn the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country need to

embassy and showing the rest of the world and we are and the things where we want to point are in your you know all of those things have made a huge difference and the un fan but I can tell you that um [noise]\nThe u._s. is wrong again any electors drawing in a way they should make all Americans are very proud of and I didn't want to say that it's not surprising and I want to follow through with it on the family in general the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me I Can't\nSay enough good things about Jared and among Darren is such\nA thing that no one understand I mean\nSure

Florida news network I'm Gordon bird\nIs on twelve fifty W H in the week night seven to ten\nAnnouncement is slated for later tonight when he visits Council Bluffs Iowa [noise]\nBig announcement apparently it has to do with ethanol and that did come up during his a little queuing age as he was leaving the White House uh and some ethanol was discussing we I was listening in and out of the audio and I I did\nHear ethanol come up a and the Trump Administration is moving to allow year round sales of gasoline with higher blends of ethanol\nAnd that's going to be big for a corn growers in these corn belt states you know South Dakota Iowa a lot of these states these big farm states they have a push\nTo increase the sales of\nOf ethanol corn based ethanol and of course there's pros and cons you know if you get to high with the ethanol content the engines don't like it or parts don't like it\nI said there's also I don't know if you've seen it but around the country I've seen you know gas stations where they ... uh you know pure gasoline no ethanol blends so I Know there are gas stations around the country to do that and we were dealing with\nA ... and with ethanol by the way I mean it's really and I I don't want to pass off any corn farmers but it was I got to speak the truth here\nYou know with ethanol there's been a whole lot of research that\nThe production of the ethanol\nThe extent that the expenditure of energy to create and the resources used to create a gallon of ethanol ... whenever you think you're saving guy you're not you know with the the the amount of water it takes to make a gallon of ethanol it's just it's just all lotta and I understand\nYou know in in these big corn producing states that this is big for corn farmers I get it but there are pros and cons and I like to discuss\nIt all so President Trump is expected to announce later tonight that he's lifting a federal ban on summers sales of e Fifteen ethanol blends\nDuring this trip to Council Bluffs Iowa later today so that's the big deal or if you just if you're just tuning in [noise] we are now it's\nCategory three with hurricane Michael it is now a category three\nThe updates that came out for the national Hurricane Center I'm at a just before five o'clock four o'clock central time or has\nThe storm at now a category three with maximum sustained winds of one hundred twenty miles an hour I there doesn't seem to be any sign of this things slowing down\nAnd courted actually intensify and get close to a category for or a category for before or after landfall I sure as hell

percent bam cut hair in Panama City were about a four or five blocks off the uh ...\nWell I don't think that's a very wise decision Brian\n[noise] well see we've we checked our evacuation zone we sit on the craft of a hill and we do not fall on any actual evacuation zone let alone one has been called to a mandatory evacuation however we also realize the repercussions of thing and possibly needing help during the height of the storm and knowing we will not right now\nAnd I often that anybody saying\nAll right so what is your elevation one so you're saying you're you're not you're four to five blocks off of off of where\nA ... day we're we're going to be on the the north side of the day\nOff of Panama City\nI and what does the elevation of your home\nOr given by the map reading on a show about twenty caught a above the bay level here and we also live in a home that several feet off the ground\nAre but they're going to gamble\nYou are you are especially you know if if you're not going to be affected by water 'cause they're calling for a storm surge eight to twelve feet and if you're not affected by water I mean still if it's a category three with maximum sustained winds of a
