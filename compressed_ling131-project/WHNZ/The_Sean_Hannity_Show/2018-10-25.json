of clue there on how quickly she got the package or where it was male for I don't know\nI'm just wondering how they've decided on Florida is a potential lead on where these packages could have been male as it doesn't mean that the bombers from Florida bummer can be from\nSomewhere else build the bombs in driving and mail them from a location I mean all these are directs the trying to throw people off the trail I was there is a a lot to talk about today\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on the program radio listeners TV viewers wherever you are would love to have the on the program eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine that we can talk about the conspiracy theories we can talk about you know the the false flag suggestions which again I'm not subscribing to any of this\nI'm going to wait for the investigation there's going to be a troll vague treasure trove of details and information and evidence you know we talked yesterday about as simple as\nThe scotch tape the scotch\nTape that was used to a fix these laser printer or inject into jet print addresses and return addresses looked like it was\nPrinted on you know normal you know copy bond and then you know cut out and and to a rectangle and then placed on to the manila padded novel ups and then just taped me any game a finger nail a skin pieces hair\nOr you can be DNA evidence under the tape or the forever stamps which I pointed out yesterday that those look like those American flag forever stamps\nOr who knows fingerprints any kind of DNA um components I mean if if ten bombs were sent you've got for instance ten of these digital clock timers\nWhere does someone get ten of you know the all the same so all the components if there was repetition and components\nIs someone gonna be able to say Oh yes some guy bought nine of these are Kennedys or twelve of these clocks and at a hardware store electronics place or a ordered online yeah there's just so many avenues of investigation I Can't even think of all the possible avenues but I think that they're going to figure out\nWho this is\nFairly shortly that's my guess I see already on hold we have a caller that says that he thinks I'm wrong at the purpose is going to be found I hey I I Want to get into all of this a lot of detail here I'll give you the the ten bombs now there are two new recipients\nAre confirmed today that receive the these bomb packages I'll get to that momentarily I've got audio I Want to play President Trump at the rally last\nNight is getting some attention speaking of the president the president tweeted out or not about the bombing something unrelated this is regarding the caravan and then I just want to give you a little breaking caravan news and then we'll go back to the the the package bombs being sent\nThe president tweeted out literally a forty minutes ago at two thirty one pm eastern time today the twenty fifth of October or from at real Donald Trump's Twitter account the president tweeted to vote was the um the caravan turn around\nWe are not letting people into the United states illegally go back to your country and if you want to apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing exclamation point\n\nI don't have a problem with this tweet this queen is on the money what what is wrong with this to those are the caravan turnaround we're not letting you add your non coming into the country illegally what is wrong with this week I Want any president\nObama well as we played that Obama audio from when he was a senator talking about we won't tolerate illegal ah migrations into this country and you know come to this country the correct way we have the Obama and Trump retweeted this Obama audio from 'em\nBefore he was president so when he was a senator what oh six oh seven whatever was [noise] and uh the president's a hundred percent right [noise] with this particular tweet also we have a\nDetails about James Mattis ah to send troops to Mexico border over immigrant the caravan\nOf the latest now on this from ah various wire services has at\nLeast eight hundred US troops\nWill be sent to the U.S Mexico border in response to this caravan which\nWas in some reports have the caravan of fourteen thousand now as it's it's like one of those cartoons snowballs going downhill we got all kinds of folders and houses and arms and legs hanging out of this thing and the second migrant caravan was over a thousand strong we heard about you know a traipsing through a a Guatemala\nSo took care of ads that they could emerge to make us so far caravan\nSo uh we'll get into more detail on this later on during the course of the program the bombs [noise] we have ten devices at this point\nSo we know about the Clintons got a device in chapel claw in Westchester County New York and uh\nThat apparently bill was home Hillary was not there I don't think they spend too much time together a\nSo one bomb to the Clintons the Obamas got the bomb and the device at the end of course the Clinton package was intercepted the Obamas a package was sent to the Washington home also intercepted so Clinton's Obama's Maxine Waters\nOr she received two packages or they were to address the her Maxine Waters was intercepted at the Capitol Hill a congressional mail center a that was in Capitol heights Maryland so far off campus for them\nAnd also in Los Angeles oh Maxine Waters recipient of two we had of course the Eric Holder package which then was on deliverable and apparently I I think that was due to insufficient postage\nOr miss address one of many insufficient postage and I and I have a picture of that\nOr so and that package to Eric Holder was then sent back to the center which the bogus a spoof a return to sender and turned out to be a Debbie Wasserman Schultz I'm Sorry Schultz a\nAnd her sunrise Florida office we know that the original package went to George Soros his house they believe that was hand delivered and they find the courage to find out who drop this thing off a we have of course the John Brennan\nAddressed package which then was delivered to CNN they also think that was courier over and that of course cause the evacuation of uh the CNN New York headquarters an old time Warner center and that was the big mess yesterday and then the two new packages are as follows Robert Deniro\nGot a package at his uh try back a film productions office in fry back to lower Manhattan just you know below canal tried that can mean the triangle below canal so that's where that package went\nAnd I'm One of his or security person a founded suspicious and I called NYPD early this morning like five AM and they responded and then a Joe Biden the recipient or addressed\nThe Joe Biden to packages and a one package was intercepted in Wilmington, Delaware the other package in New castle Delaware so that makes a total of ten how many more are out there that's the question\nNow again there's just so many little details that I find fascinating and interesting we'll get into those so why a\nRobert Deniro could be at some of the nasty remarks that that Robert Deniro made regarding President Trump because it appears that you have a lot of these people are critics were outspoken against the president and it is it's\nIs it a right wing young not sending these or is it a Democrat sending it to Democrats to make it seem like who knows again I'm not sure if the guinea conclusions but we do know that the people that are vocally against Trump some of these people have received these packages and that brings me to Robert De Niro and\nSome of his audio ... I've got to audio bites on the narrow that I Want to play which there was a red just before the election which we have to bleep\nUh and then we have of course uh at uh the uh Tony Awards\nOr what the

these critics of his that's a form and did this or this violence or the the mailing of these packages come on like the first of all\nI Am I happy with all of Trump's rhetoric and when he gets into bully mode I'm not happy I I tell you about it on the program\nI'm happy with a lot of the components of the job he's doing but not always you know the the rally mentality and and uh you know the seeming to\nPut a stamp of approval on the body slamming instead of a gene for the ... and the and the the reporter the the congressional candidate ... up in Montana I I don't think that's helpful\nI Wish that the president I Wish Trump would refrain I'm Sorry I don't give a seal of approval to everything President Trump says it does\nI like a lot of what he's doing but I Will tell you when he's crossed the line here but let me be very clear even with his ramped up rhetoric there is only one person to blame for these packages and is the bomber\nIn as well practically no bombs exploded so are they a bomber or just a bomb manufacturing a a lame bomb manufacturer or that intentional who knows there are so many questions to be answered but again\nThis is not Donald Trump's fault this is the bombers fall must be one hundred percent clear the only person responsible is whoever is assembling and mailing and targeting these individuals with these packages\nDone that's it\nWith that said what I liked the president to be more civil and delivery of course I Want but it's all the way around it's the president it's the pundits it's the rhetoric gets the media it's it's it's everything but it doesn't justify somewhat mailing out ten packages at this point and the big question is how many more remain\nHow many more of these packages are still floating around\nSitting somewhere in a pile of

because we're coming up in the polls were you know we're ... hadn't a lot of these races and it just doesn't make any sense from that point of view just for a talking point the second one is\nI'm thinking that maybe is ISIS is China it's Iran nobody seems to be giving that us thought or even\nA talking point about it and I want to know your thoughts on that\nWell you'll have fallen out and in fact I mentioned this yesterday is just you know throwing on possibilities\nI'm like hey I don't know what could be the Russians the Russians have you know proven they interfere in our elections you know the Chinese are also interfering as well or hold on to be the the Chinese could be the Russians and you know trying to cause turmoil prior to our elections\nSounds more like a like an ISIS or its Alibaba thing if we're going to be anybody\nYeah there is some weird aspect and speaking of ISIS did you see that there was a kind of an ISIS flag spoof that was included or at least on one of the devices did did you see that\nYeah I did it was reported this morning and\nYou know I don't know we're just going to have to wait and see but you know Democrats got stopped throwing the mud at Trump you know I mean fix them when they're down ... civil get in their faces soon as they hit the streets just the Republican yell at him yeah wouldn't be surprised if somebody finally got yelled at and went off\nBy but also I mean I think Trump on a tone it down as well I think that he ought to bang going some I think he ought to back off some of the rhetoric as well\nI think they ought to stand up for 'em Schumer Nancy Trump and all of them should just stand up together on one stage and say enough is enough\nAh hey John in San Diego beautiful part of the country thanks for the call I Would have

as ISIS\nOr this is so much crap it's already come out on this so there was an ISIS has already flag a fixed to one of the devices and that was the device sent to John Brennan\nThe former CIA director address care of CNN in Columbus Circle in Manhattan yesterday and apparently the ISIS flag was printed out on some printing device and then a fixed to the bomb\nAnd it was an ISIS flag parity from a movie ... Internet piece of artwork mean that has been circulating for have you know three four years I think it goes back to a twenty four team\nAnd uh the instead of having the ISIS a print in Arabic or whatever language it is\nA it shows in sort of a an Arabic looking font it says get her done\nLike ... year year dude like ... you know Larry the cable guy his\nAct and then it also had a the silhouette outline and you know you know the crumb truck mud flap lady\nYou know what I'm Talking about on the back of trucks you see them every once in a while I was probably not a very ah politically correct in the meat to generation here but the the trucker mud flaps with the the the hourglass figured book some woman with a very thin waist\nSitting down with her arms that are aside and it's the side profile and they're cut out of chrome\nAnd they they they made their their appearance I think back in the seventies historically\nAs as crook mud flap weights\nAnd you see them there there are a lot of times they're chrome and it's just the ... city and there was also with this this ISIS flag looking replica get her done also had a three of these women\nAre two sitting down or you know back to back you left profile right profile and then there was um\nA one standing up or you know different versions so [laughter] you know here we we've got an I ... a flag parody we've got the return address being that Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nThere's get her done ISIS flight thing was done back apparently in twenty fourteen by a world news bureau which is described as a a right wing parity website and\nNews I'm Gordon bird former Lakeland city commissioner Michael Dunn is getting bail as he awaits trial on his second degree murder charge a judge said his bond at one hundred and fifty thousand dollars with house arrest done is also prohibited from working at his surplus store where he shot crystal ball Lopez October third unfortunately\nNot maybe to work the places which are

NBC today Megan Kelly\nMight not returns the NBC they did a rerun today we'll get into that and just a minute I said just finishing up on the audio mine I ran out of time I thought I had a little more time to get it in so I Want to pick up where I left off\nAnd this is MSNBC is Ben Collins and he's talking about that little ISIS parity flag\nWith the two uh the the three women are two of them patterned after that chrome a female mud flap a silhouette of the books some woman sitting down and you'll see on the back of trucks or mud flap some time to time\nAnd that was apparently flag and ISIS and and instead of the Arabic or ISIS inscription it says get her done in a well sort of a a farm that resembles that so there was a there's some kind of an accounting parity aspect to whoever put these\nThese devices together at least on one of them with his eyes his parents who was talking about the ISIS parity flag and\nWhere it came about and there was a you know a a an Internet means started by a guy in Arizona back in twenty fourteen and then\nHe starts to allude to the fact of the person\nWho could be involved here well they view a certain website they watch a certain TV network here is the remainder of the audio clip\nIt's been around like conservative like Web forums not like a young people like for can stuff I'm Talking like you know people who follow the Drudge Report and Fox News and stuff like that it's that sort of circle\nWho rarely so the\nThe ISIS parity or maybe the fact that the guy or whoever I'm sure it's a guy that put the thing to get to grab that ISIS parity thing that was a mean and I never saw that I I I knew all kinds of stuff I see more stuff on a daily basis than Ninety nine percent of Americans most likely because of the nature of my job I haven't seen this Saturday\nSo it's very obscure I'll tell you that right now\nAnd forever suggest that oh well since the person use this on the device that they must be a a a Fox News watcher and ah

there is a leaner askew at his regime dizzy lean to the right he does and sometimes you'll see a you know the some of the stories that appear to be up you know moral ah right leaning but again\nAll of the stories that are covering Trump from the other side are always posted\nOn brunch the fact is\nAnd this do this or Ben Collins at MSNBC you ought to know better every damn newsroom in the country goes to drudge every TV station every assignment editor reporters come on anchors\nThey researchers they checked drudge multiple times a day at every mainstream outlet the mainstream news media

so act CEOs the Web site Axios started by some a former folks that were at a political I actually had some kind of a form\nThis was an act CEOs event to day so this is fresh former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich he uh disavowed or any of the right wing conspiracies\nSo you've got left wing right wing all kinds of conspiracies of flying here and Newt Gingrich was on there was a panel discussion or he was a moderator asking Newt Gingrich questions at this event listen to this audio Mr Speaker\nYesterday a conservative right away started saying on TALK radio\nPackage mail bombs world falls flat a conspiracy by the left\nTo make a look quite the right wing did you agree with\nI don't think we know who's doing what and I think are only physician ought to be that uh people who engage in acts which could lead possess should leave caught tried the strictest possible penalties and preferably locked up for life and\nI feed you cannot tolerate a society you're not you're not going to keep a free society if people believe they can get away with violence or just because they think is a senior\nSo should these conservative hosting conservative commentators who we're talking about conspiracy theory should they put a second\nYeah I think with a focus on is whoever did this however they were motivated whoever financed and a should in fact be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nDon't care who did it a son you know taking steps to harm people inevitably when a breakdown in the very fabric of our society\nSo why was there is such a quick move on the right to say this was the customers 'cause it's October [laughter]\nWell there you go Newt Gingrich I agree with Newt just wait we don't know whoever is whenever ... if they're on the political spectrum in which every direction they need to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law\nBut on this talk radio program I didn't jump to oh my God this is a false flag it's it's it's it's a supporters of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats who are hoping for a democratic blue wave they did this and they're trying to make it seem like\nIt's a horrific Trump supporters\nRepublicans conservatives that are mailing these packages the Democrats\nWe don't know and it was refreshing to hear Newt Gingrich say just knock it off with all of this conspiracy BS and that's what I did on the program\nMean we talked about uh what's being discussed and I'm disavow in all of that way for the damn investigation\nI got to believe what ten packages whoever put their stuff together has slipped up and they left\nSome fingerprints remnant DNA hair fiber ... traces the electronics that are used that were apparently you know used at least ten times\nThey got to find something and there's going to be an arrest I'm guessing within days maybe a week ten days tops\nAnd then we'll find out who it is and then we'll talk about it and what the motivations were\nA eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number here on Schmidt lumped heavy on on any of what's happening and there's no shortage folks every single day the other question is are there more devices out their undiscovered tend to vice I mean three more devices today\nThe two devices sent to Joe Biden incidentally one of his biting devices had posted you do because it costs more than three dollars the battle pipe bomb\nSo yeah the the Joe ... one of the Joe Biden addressed packages to went to Delaware and one of the packages are looking at I got a picture of the image right now it was sent to\nA Joe civil Robyn at abiding junior\nAnd there's a postage due of Seventy five cents because there were a three forever stamp some air so that's three dollars right and I said yesterday they they got these American flight forever say those are the fans I use what I mail letters\nAnd yeah you still to mail letters from time to time folks got metal check here and there are you know it's not always a wire transfer using vale or whatever uh [noise] three three Seventy five\nOr six so they're they're six steps on it so uh there there are six forever stamps so it's a it's three dollars\nAnd uh the postage due was a three Seventy five so there's a Seventy five cent balance on one of the bombs that the the Joe Biden [noise] uh well I'm looking at the right to sue maybe trying to find a link to the story\nAnd give up on the ... that lived at that show [noise]\nDot com [noise] a boy I Am and what about the president the president last night you know calling for unity\nThis was that the Trump rally last night let's listen to a little bit of the president many kind of backed off this in a tweet this morning I I think the president is probably best to stick with what he said last night [noise]\nThere is one way to serve the largest agreements it's called peacefully at the ballot box that's when we\nFar to the larger national effort to rejoice divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil or\nAs you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nAny hack but also in fairness here\nAh you know the president and I I Would be not worth\nEvery saltier if I didn't bring up the fact that the president himself can be vitriolic\nAnd he can be offensive and he can be a little bully from time to time so I like many aspects of the president in your face and saying certain certain things but there are other items that we can make you know a catalog\nOr where it was in very presidential already ought to back off and I'm Sorry those that think that that uh because the Trump and the the the right or not the left rather is against them and then anything from doesn't says is the best and right on and and in their faces I mean that doesn't make it right\nAnd I know there were many conservatives many of my conservative friends or whether the written media or not\nThey were in agreement with me and it's like listen we liked the bulk of the president's policies he's done a great job on many levels we supporters immigration policy we want the migrant caravan stopped\nBut you know some of the rhetoric and some of the vitriol and some of the president's ah you know bully is tendencies I ill parallel or rival what the media does in some will say oh he's just responding to the media not always\nHistorically look back so it goes both ways I agree the president said hey let's settle things at the ballot box let's have a degree you only here but also to be genuine awe is to\nAlso recognize that the president hasn't been the best in how he's presented things sometimes or\nOf political violence aren't attack on\nOur democracy itself\nEngaged in the political arena must stop

discuss\nThe president with two tweets this morning one at six fifty for this morning and then another tweet at nine fifty seven this morning and this is all regarding a New York\nTimes report when Trump phones friends the Chinese and the Russians listen and learn and this was a a new article written by a Matthew Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman over at\nThe New York times so I'll get into some of the nuts and bolts of this in just a moment first though the president tweeting and responding to this the first one\nThis so called experts on Trump over at the New York times wrote a long and boring article on my cell phone usage that is so incorrect I Do not have time here to correct it I only used governments phones\nAnd have only one seldom used government cell phone\n\nStory is so\nWrong S. oh oh oh oh it looks like a old ... owns ... story is so wrong and that was before seven o'clock then just before ten o'clock this morning the president tweeted\nThe New York times has a new fake story\nThat now the Russians in Chinese in parentheses glad they finally had to China\nClosed parentheses are listening to all of my calls on cell phones except that I rarely use a cell phone and when I Do it's government authorized I like hard line just more made up fake news so that's the president responding to what\nWell to this\nAnd essentially the um the cliff notes version here the\nClaim is Maggie Haberman from the New York times climbing the Trump has been repeatedly told and warned that the Chinese\nThe Russians are listening when he is on\nHis cell phone\nAnd Chinese spies Russian Spies you know we've heard about these weird a cell phone tower or emulate patients that are occurring in Washington I'm the shark device and the shark too I think it is now\nAnd it's essentially the

which intelligence agency\nI'm could operate that they they're not cheap they cost several hundred thousand dollars these devices and then you could intercept the data the texts intercept the voice ah transmissions\nAnd well if your a foreign government or foreign intelligence agency well could be a treasure trove and it's been a lot of concern that with members of Congress and senators and house of representatives members and and cabinet members all over D.C there have been that these reports are that there have been\nThese mysterious a essentially cell phone emulate is er replicated is\nThat had been discovered in in or been around in their mobile they can come and go and disappear again I don't think we've heard everything I don't know if anything has been intercepted if there have been any confiscation or arrests or you know whether anything been kept secret\nBut the technology is out there in order to intercept\nAnd according to the New York times piece a speaking of Trump he's
