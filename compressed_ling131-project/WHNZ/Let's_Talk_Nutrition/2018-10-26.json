court system ... analyst and so forth\nAnd how that relates to one's houses I\nI Know that you're you're lacking in something just like me when I worked on a team in the hospital you gotta miss that everything coming to fruition every time and working on that team there is no better feline\nAm I right then and then being part of that team and especially when you when a case you know it's a it just releases something then and how do we replace that now that we're you know kind of working you you work somewhat on a team but me I'm you know with the patient only show it's tough\nYeah well I don't really know what you do is very important and and and should be rewarding um you're dealing with a population of people that are almost forgotten\nA and I don't say that in the hyperbolic way ... as you well know I have a point of view about the way we treat the elderly in our culture and our society that it's a pretty critical of it\nAnd the people that you work with I daresay I don't know what percent of them I Wonder how many of them are really alone I mean I don't know you may be the only person they see sometimes\nWell that's that's one of the problems I Need that I Need that camaraderie sometimes from someone that's not and they don't do a purposely but it it draws a lot of energy out of me you know Dr two or three years ago they did a study and found ... and the blood\nAnd ... and the body to issues of cooking and this thing with plastic I Know I can hear your voice you're disappointed but I Know you're not surprised I mean I spend a fortune on food and everything that I eat and drink comes in plastic everything\nEverything and I see people microwaving and I would just besieged you anybody do not microwave anything with it in a plastic container\nDon't do it I just don't get the microwave or microwave will break down the molecular structure that plastic\nAnd and bottled they're finding it in bottled water is because the bottle you know that they need the bottle in the car maybe bill and it gets so hot\nAnd it just breaks down and those chemicals leach into the water and you ingest them a yeah it's terrible I mean we live in a\nA as a society of convenience or world of convenience but it is but it's not it's convenience without not without consequences in my opinion\nIs the most surprising thing that I see an AR\n... granola crunchers like you and I and so many people is that the people that are really health conscious they still microwave\nThey will buy everything they that touches their mouth from whole foods and then to get over their house and that microwave thing and ... and I'm like thinking wow but here's here's one other little thing that even the even the hardcore people like me forget until I was pointed out to me by a\nA Dr Marshall yes a radio show\nAnd had gone kind of Bob Marshall yeah he passed when I couldn't believe it but I yeah I did work mhm a from a dental procedure but anyway actually cold leeches chemicals out of plastic to I didn't know that yeah they did\nA study and in that it's just every time you hear that pop and cracking that's releasing things into it and I'm like oh my gosh but Yeah Dr Marshall was a genius\nAnd he was he used to be on a in the afternoon he came home right before me when I did my show in the afternoon\nBut I appreciate your comments I I think the work that you do you know it was important those poor souls you deal with that or by themselves at home and you go and try to help him a I dare say they're probably more than a few you're the only person they get to talk to sometimes\nAppreciate that dock thank you yeah and you take care of those people\nThey're forgotten so Gary was in the supermarket and he texted me and what did you tell me\nI said time magazine on their front cover has\nA article about the new mindfulness\nYeah and I've been is you know if you listen to the show I've been talking about mindfulness for quite a while\nAnd how I came how I came upon it was an unfortunate way right and I didn't even realize what I was doing\nAnd in when\nI got sick a couple of years ago and was so sick ah I had to find a way to make it\nAnd at the time I didn't understand you know and it was all instinct nobody nobody told me no I didn't read anything I just it just it was in ... instinctive and what I learned to do in order to make it\nA ... ... ... we already have the capacity to be in the president is not something you have to dig deep for its it's instinctive I learned that\nAnd it doesn't require you to change who you are it doesn't um we it's ... it's an innate quality I discovered that by accident I again I told you in an unfortunate way but I discovered it\nAnd it is in that and you can develop it\nAnd it's been scientifically shown to provide wonderful benefits to people everything from creating a better state of calm more focus better mental health uh and so on\nBeing more appreciative more grateful it's interesting what effect it has and you don't need to\nDo this wholesale alteration or change in your personality which you can't do any way or your life\nIt's it's like bringing in a beautiful painting into the house [laughter] you know you didn't change anything but you hung this beautiful painting a portrait on the wall or the all of a sudden the dynamic of the room changes because of that one thing\nAnd that sort of what mindfulness is like you bring it into your life and all of a sudden everything changes\nUh and you don't have to you know tear down the building and rebuild and remodel in none of that needs to go on and it is has the ability to be transformative\nA four person\nAnd mindfulness practice is something that anybody can do is not hard it is in fact it's for me as a way I understand it what I Believe about it is that it it is who we are we have just drifted away from that\nAnd for ... in this very frenetic modern high tech you know a digital distracting world that we live in nobody's focused on the moment I don't know what I don't know what they're doing I have no clue\nAnd it's it's funny that you you put it that way 'cause I was thinking as you're saying that it's because we've got so much going on now whether it's lives and families and technology and the news and phones and everything\nThat we are multi tasking all the time all the time that we can't just sit and focus on that one thing that is in front of us have you on them and we feel like we're wasting our time doing that right or missing out yeah you have ... ... yeah you're missing out\n... [laughter] if you're missing out ... he's right Steven is absolutely on point about that\nAnd what I've learned to do that it it's amazing how focusing on the moment how enlightening that is and how um liberating it's liberating you're not burdened with stuff you can't control anyway\nI win a trapping skeet shooting yesterday afternoon good okay and you have to focus on being there right then and there\nOkay outta forty clays though and they hit ten so that kind of reset your mind and when you think of what I'm thinking now that you mentioned I'm thinking of archers archery is ah people who shoot use firearms and they go to the firing ... you have to focus\nTo hit that target you can only be thinking about that ... that it takes you have to be mindful when you're handling weapons and what not to hit the target\nYou that in the Olympics they have the the Winter Olympics you know that one event I don't know what they call it where they ski and they have the rifle yes the ... the training for that is remarkable\nAnd the athlete has to be in the moment under great stress\nBy us one right that is that is I'm Amazed and it's all by breathing you you learn you can learn so much from watching that\nYet or are handling a farm it's sign language and trigger pulling the trigger pulls based on breathing breathing and you have to be in the moment you can't be thinking about\nSomething you did yesterday are going to do tonight or tomorrow you\nHave to be in that moment right yes yes otherwise you're not gonna hit the target no or you could hit ... you could make a mistake so\nThis has great application I promise you you if you explore it and then you if you want to take it further and getting into mindful meditation there's a whole school of\nThought about it I have found that a life saving it has been for me it has really been a a wonderful thing for me to experience a and I use it I sometimes I drift away from it and I catch myself\nNot to go off topic but a question was is there a way to get the plastics out of your body [noise]\nAnd I sent you a little bit of article on that to leave the planet F um [noise] I don't I don't know if I have an answer to that\nI I don't know if I have an answer the Emmy cleansing I don't know it gets into the tissues [noise] I don't know to what extent I don't have to do some research and see\nWhat what are the implications of of these micro plastics being in the cells tissues in Oregon\nKen the body can deliver can the lungs canned the blood can all these systems of of of purifying an elimination detoxification do the job\nI don't know I'm not sure about that\nAnd by the way I just want to point out through the new listeners and our listeners this is why this is a such a fun show because I don't think we mentioned one supplement one thing about nutrition or anything like that in a sense we just we had a conversation about health and lifestyle and it was a it was on our yeah the world\nThe life life this is a show about life\nAnd I'm ...

S. P. which is a U.S standard form of ... there that basically the rule book here's what you test for years the contaminants do you need to check for years the machinery that you need to use to be able to test for that\nAnd we do do that but we also look and say well there's still things that that's missing and so we used for instance for testing we use what's called the mass\nSpectrometer it's a forensic machine it goes down to parts per billion versus\nA another machine that the U. S. P. requires a test to parts per million so we go almost go down to ten thousand times smaller down to the DNA level and were able to find things there in in products is products from our suppliers that we say this is not acceptable so\nAre we sending that back and this is things that even the Canadian government doesn't require us to test for so\nThese are just a few of the things that we go into a to make sure that we have the highest quality products on the market today\nAnd that and that doesn't come at without expense doesn't\nKnow it doesn't and these are also the ... when you're talking about expense this is something that ah you know we talk about a public company this is something that the shareholders and\nUh that are really driving hard on is that ah you know where are you spending the money to the money that could be in my pocket so this is another reason why we are private company is Roland realizes no public companies get a shell out the money for\nA well could be potentially losing monetary venture into in farms which is you know very expensive and very expensive to maintain or\nDoing all these extra testing right to say okay we'll do all this extra test it will get a mass spectrometer but ah what's the bottom line the U.S the shareholders how much more money can we make well nothing other than the fact of doing that you have the best quality product out there they say well that's not good enough so rolling\nThat's one of the reasons why role and says they never will be a public company or have the investors have a majority share because he wants to make this his legacy and so you just want to have anybody hold them back from doing things that he feels will get even higher quality product that what's out there\nA seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five if you have a question or comment or you'd like to share don't hesitate to call us or or send Gary you know he's monitoring the Utah\nMonitoring Facebook right now you can join us on Facebook and send us a message to Facebook or Dr ... uh an email at ... dot com\nAnd go to our subscribe to a YouTube channel let's talk nutrition where you can actually send a message there also ... ...
