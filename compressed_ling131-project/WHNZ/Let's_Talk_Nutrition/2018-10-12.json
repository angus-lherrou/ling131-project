a\nReport to use sharing a reporter with you about this one talked to a doctor Barron from the University of Wisconsin\nHe's a patient comes into the office it's become in the middle of cold and flu season I Can't tell you that I have a hard time telling the difference\nOr you can go with the flu I can tell you this it comes on quick\nIt's like right now you can go from feeling just fine just sick right away I mean right away instantly\nSo that's one good sign or that you have the flu cold a cold will last about three to five days of flu will tend to linger maybe twice as long [noise] and\nUh a fever as far more common with the flu although you can you could get at ... and is also with that you'll get headaches as well those those those numbing headaches with the flu and body aches and a dry cough\n\nNow if you have a cop that produces a lot of fluid or mucus and you have a sore throat and you're sneezing or dealing with the runny nose or had congestion those all sort of speak\nTo or indicate you have a cold\nStomach ache diarrhea and all these other GI gastrointestinal symptoms I'm\nThere you can get those were the cold or flu and as\nYou have the symptoms signs and symptoms you're probably dealing with the uh you know if he got a lot of GI upset um to be something else to\nSo and then there's the timing of your signs and symptoms symptoms are are subjective you know like pain can't ... you can't see it uh signs are things are empirical we can see them\nYou know the phlegm and whatnot uh\nThe timing or you have to be concerned all the time but a more there I'm this whole notion of I remember I'm reading an article by William Norcross um he said they are\nThey are somewhat more common and winter when people continually ah when people commonly gather indoors what he's referring to our\nColds and when you catch a cold and any you can catch a cold anytime of the year\nThe flu usually confined to the winter wintertime winters\nScheduled cold is all year flew right around now until march so I Hope that you find is helpful um\nWhy is that that the flu only shows up during winter months usually a that's an that's an interesting question um you never really hear about a summer and I've got the flu\nYeah that's right it has something to do there's a there's a technical term for that I'll look it up my computer just blew up but you know I\nI have no more memory on my computer so I Can't get to it oh have you have to wait to get a break [laughter] uh eight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five eight seven seven eight nine seven talk\nThere is a um story trending about obesity\nBeing a risk factor for for women and doubling their odds\nOf for colon cancer wow\n[noise] a race of colon cancer have declined that some good news uh where people are among um among people who are fifty an older\nHowever they ... they seem to be on an upswing for younger people\nThis uh this new research suggests a widening waist lines\nObesity\nAs one of the a risk as the risk factor\nIn a study women uh there were twenty to forty nine who are overweight or obese those women had twice the risk for colon cancer\nWow before age fifty compared with normal weight women\nSo I keep saying you know obesity is not just a static issue it's not just say I'm getting\nA practical issue of closed fitting and what not it's a very threatened the health threatening to some doctors now called a disease so\n[noise] yeah\nBoy oh boy it we and we we just\nAnd drier climates when it's humid and boy we know a thing about humidity around here in Tampa Bay water droplets or that are in the air fall to the ground\nOkay think about that\nHeavier boom this is because they're heavier\nAnd when this happens any viruses are germs surviving in those droplets also become victims of falling to the ground in the winter it's less humid\nThan it is during the very hot days of summer therefore water droplets in the air survive longer and prolong than the amount of time the virus can sustain itself in the air instead of falling to the ground and getting destroyed\n\nNow there are some studies that support or confirm that hypothesis\nUm you have to go and look\nFor yourself I haven't done a real thorough review of the literature on this I'm just trying to piece together some explanations there's another variable in play\nDuring the wintertime people tend to go indoors\nAnd when you get a lotta people indoors in close contact with one another transmission is a lot easier\n\nI can tell you one thing here in Florida you're not going to find a bunch of people stand up in some room or without an air conditioner they're ... they're going to be outside in the summertime down here that let me tell you\nFor sure so people are not collected yeah the kids in school there in that classroom all day long or in classrooms close contact with other kids so that's another variable that accounts for why\nThe flu is more prominent during the wintertime\n[laughter] that's that's that's the\nBest I can do I gave you two good reasons\nAs to why it might um be the case that the flu is more associated with with the winter\nIt has something to do with the humidity and it has something to do with people being indoors does that help Steven\nListening he's busy\nEight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five eight seven seven eight nine seven talk so\n\nThat makes sense Gary it does I that that's all that you know I I Know that preparation I didn't I just think about every time we're in a plane\nYou know you almost we almost get sick I'm going to go in the class that was the one thing I hate it in the wintertime was going to class because you knew the ending up because I worked in so I knew I was

perfect breeding environment for mosquitoes in ticks are and\nWe're going to see you know these vector that a greater risk for these vector borne diseases which are transmitted by ticks mosquitoes and these other organisms\n[noise] that's one of the things they predict is going to happen and\nContaminated water sources in dangerous bacterial infections they predict is gonna be a another consequence\nClimate change extreme weather and rain falls have contributed is said to the spread of bacterial infections drew contaminated water especially during the summer\nTemperatures will only make\nThose those things worse [noise]\nThey even talk about an increase in mental illness\nThey say that he and I'm just I'm reporting to what the science says even um they sort of a small rise in

there are becoming more common it's right before our eyes and there was a concern that malaria could re emerge in the United states close quote [noise]\nYou know I ...
