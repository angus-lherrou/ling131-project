Dr Michael dark I\nWhere we see much and ah people around us that are part of our lives and what not\nBut we also live in a world where we don't see much at all\nWelcome back to let's talk nutrition nationally syndicated globally streamed and what I'm referring to is the world of pathogens\nMicroscopic organisms that are transmitted directly and indirectly\nAnd uh this is by way of talking about and setting up a conversation about silver ... and I'll have Dr bird is in Studio explain the direct transmission of these pathogens path to pathogenic means disease causing\nA direct transmission involves the spread of pathogens by direct body to body contact\nLike H. P. V. sixteen for example sexually transmitted virus\nDirect transmission of Kurt can occur from mother to child uh like with HIV with the secret bars with syphilis for example\nOr this type of direct transmission mother to child is also known as vertical transmission case you want to know other types of direct contact through which pathogens can spread include touching MRSA\nThe bane of existence is one kissing herpes simplex virus is transmitted that way for example sexual contact and I've been talking about human papillomavirus\nThe indirect transmission of pathogens involves contact with the surface\nOr substance that is contaminated with pathogens and it's like influenza on the virus could be sitting on a tabletop on the door knob on clothing on\nWherever right\nSo there's direct and indirect these pathogens are part of our life we just don't see them and they can take you out they can take your life away\nAnd they're you know the airborne the types of indirect transmission include airborne droplets food borne\nOr waterborne zoo tonic what does that suit tonic is the spread of a pathogen from animals to humans those are the indirect ways or viruses are and are pathogens are spread bacteria viruses and so one\nSilver ... makes a product that can help with this right absolutely and explain how that is Dr Bert\nWell if a person is infected with a virus but that virus can't be reproduced it's not going to hurt the person\nThe animal so if you consume um the silver by addicts you can take it on a daily basis take it when you feel something coming on or if you've been exposed to something that you want to feel a little increase your immune system or improve your immune system\nThe silver by addicts has many many a research studies that it will prevented virus from reproducing the bacteria is\nI'm In the east and mold that actually neutralizes the pathogens so it it can't do any harm to your body even if you're exposed to it and that's the blessing of a product like this because it's safe for everybody and it doesn't it's not expensive\nAnd uh whether you know you have a pregnant women or you may or may not choose the vaccine process\nEven if you choose a vaccine you can still use the silver backs you can use it with meds you can use it with your supplements so it's easy inexpensive ineffective\n... ... a seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five if you have a question or comment in terms of types of pathogens uh uh they're they're diverse\nAnd our our consist of both uh ... ... and you karate organisms are the most commonly known passages and of course as I talk about on the show a lot or bacteria and viruses mhm\nBoth are capable of causing infections and or infectious diseases but they're very different bacteria are ... are are cells that cause disease by producing toxins okay viruses\nAre particles of nucleic acid DNA and or are in a in case in a small a protein shell or caps it\nThat's what's interesting about um they're ... they're they're nucleic in nature\nThey cause disease by taking over the yourselves the ... they they start controlling the cell the machinery of the show so to do what they want to replicate and they start making copies of themselves\nOr\nThey've had millions of years to figure this out these little rascals uh this is activity destroys the host cell and then of course it's multiple cells\nEuchre you karate pathogens include fungi ... approaches and parasitic worms Dr Ingraham is the only guess that comes on the show and talks about those creatures\nAnd the doctor bird that's it and that's why I like having them on the show by the way I'm [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Let's Talk Nutrition", "city": "Tampa", "day": "08"}
