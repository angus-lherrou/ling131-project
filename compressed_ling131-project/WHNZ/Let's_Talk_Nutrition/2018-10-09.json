press grades to create you know the juice to to to produce wine or grapes use its first profit and then from there it goes through a series of memory\nIs membranes are like scream\nAnd as the uh the elder Barry material right that the press juice with all the skin in the fibers and stuff\nI just passing through the membrane what's happening is it's collecting a membrane material the fibers material and the process is removing also the sugars now two things happen here\nNumber one is you're collecting all the most nutritious parts of the elder very like I said skins the fibers material and you're moving out the sugar\nAt the same time you also preserving all the vitamins and minerals and other nutrients\n'em the benefit of that in particular is that sugar if you look at most of the elder very products on the market\nThey don't go through this type of a membrane processes they might be alcohol extracted or just pressed and then dried and cap slated there loaded with sugar up to eight grams of sugar per dose and the problem is is that on one hand you're getting you know some some perhaps some immune benefits from the from the elder very\nBut on the other hand you're getting all the sugar which we know from lots of studies out there and and your information that's available is that sugar counteract the immune systems activity to protect the body you know the fabulous bites which ... which destroy microbes and viruses there and have it in like sugar\nSo it's kind of a a conflict there that you have you know and you know if you're eating you know ... the elder varies you know raw that's fine you know you're not getting a lot of sugar unless you're eating a massive amounts but then when you're concentrating the product\nMhm when you're making a supplement that into sugar levels go up a lot so with the new chapter process the true to fruit membrane extraction we get that sugar out of there ... all you're getting it all that that fibers material the skins where you have all of that really good ... material that people are seeking you know when they take an elder very proud\nTurns out that elder berries as you heard Andrew say are I'm\nA rich in ... and a particular um type of flab annoyed a answer a sigh Annan's or the answer is ... ... as what gives the elder Barry plant that very deep purple color\nAlmost black coloring a and these are saying that after ... are a powerful very effective antioxidants and they keep the immune system a very resilient and responsive or turns out that\nAnswer a sigh Annan's an elder berries boost the production of what are called cytokines\nThat is a part of your immune system there proteins and they're like messengers for the immune system and they take an enhanced the system now turns out they they play a crucial role these cytokines they can be um\nBoth inflammatory an anti inflammatory depending on what was going on I don't want to get into the weeds about that but just to understand that uh and as Andrew said eating too much sugar sometimes on here but some of the um ... molecules that work\nOr in cells at work or as part of the immune system like the macro fires is or whatever and you don't want to you don't want to impair their performance so\nBut that was the berries are rich and after a sigh Annan's and of course they are a class of flab annoyed so the I mean this is not hocus pocus this is this is real it is the science of nutrition right\nYeah that's right yeah I mean there's a lot of studies out there on elder very I think the national library of medicine has over a thousand studies just\nConfirming the potential immune enhancing benefits of elder Barry ... ... do it it's just really important especially when I when people are making a choice about their immune health especially their stress over you know or you know cold and flu season coming in how bad it was last year you know you want to make sure that the product that you're taking", "show_name": "Let's
