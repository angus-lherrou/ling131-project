T. T. it's\nThe most widely used method to measure cardio respiratory fitness which I'm going to tell you what it is in a minute and serves as an objective measure of aerobics fitness and moderate vigorous physical activity\nWithout relying on self report self report is fine but sometimes when you get people to self report\nThey\nNot necessarily intentionally but don't give you the right data [laughter] let me being polite um sometimes they just flat out lie okay and other times they are just mistaken faulty memory they miss perceive they don't understand it some report\nIs great I mean it's great for interviews and I get down and in qualitative studies I I've done my share of that\nBut it can be problematic so this study uh was wanting to look at the association of cardio respiratory fitness with the outcome measure being long term mortality would it improve long term mortality\nAnd in the study they they found that\nThe it did improve it\nThe adjusted mortality risk of read a reduced performance on the uh ATT was comparable to a said if not greater than traditional clinical risk factors\nFor example coronary artery disease and smoking\nA\nAnd more more importantly they said there was no upper limit of the benefit of increased aerobics a fitness now you see a lot of people go to the gym in our lifting weights that's not a real big exercise that's anaerobic\nRight difference\nBuilding bigger muscles is one thing having cardio respiratory fitness is another and should you do both go more muscle mass and be respiratory cardio respiratory fit absolutely definitely so what is cardio respiratory fitness\nSince we're talking about it simply it's the ability of your circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to your muscles your skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity\nSimply what it is getting more oxygen to the cells and tissues of your skeletal muscles\nThe primary measure for cardio respiratory fitness is what they call V. O. V. O. to match\nThe oath to max that's the metric what video to max means is Maximo oxygen consumption\nMaximo oxygen uptake peak oxygen uptake or Maximo aerobics capacity\nAnd that's the maximum rate of oxygen consumption measured doing incremental exercise in other words they measure how much oxygen your cells and tissues of your muscles can collect\nDuring a a period of exercise incremental exercise maxim how much will they take up and use\nMac V. O. to max ... it's a very important measure\nUh and its use all the time that's a metric that are doctors pay attention to you know athletes trainers and whatnot\nNevertheless ah lest I divert too far in twenty six team the American Heart Association published\nA a a scientific statement advocating for cardio respiratory fitness well that wasn't too hard to do\nAnd a ... trying to encourage people to engage in more exercise that would promote it\nWhat are the kinds of exercises that will promote cardio respiratory fitness walking running swimming jumping dancing sex\nWhat did he say yes I did yes\nOkay and there is anything where you're getting your circulatory and respiratory systems to work\nRight and\nRest at rest\nYou know you're just sitting there how much energy how many calories does it take to keep all the systems up your body working so you don't die\nRight\nLike you know breathing [laughter] blood circulation body temperature cell division a cell growth brain and nervous function those all require blinking up your eye whatever it might be\nA muscle contractions there's all require you're breathing muscles are moving I mean that all takes energy so when you're sitting there how much energy does it take to accomplish all that what's your ... metabolic rate\nThe Beijing metabolic rate affects the rate I told you a moment ago that a person burns calories and ultimately whether that person can maintain and gain or lose weight that's true it does it is associated with white\nUh and as I said to you also the M M Ms or metabolic rate MBR will account for about six to eight to Seventy five percent of your daily calorie expenditure think about that for a second\n\nAlmost Seventy five percent of the calories you burn every day is just to keep your ... ... when you're at rest to keep your systems going at rest never mind when you got 'em\nYou're more amplified\n\nSo that's what bays will metabolic rate as you understand that\nYou're yes okay so you're asking me about what I'm resting heart rate okay the reason why I ask is because\nI'm a friend of mine was a Ninety seven and now he's at sixty seven okay resting heart rate is the number of times your heart beats per minute\nBeep PM ... you know ... beats per minute while that complete rest same thing with the they do these they take these measurements when your basement metabolic rate when you're at rest how many calories does it take to keep everything going when you're at rest race\nThe heart rate just what the word means resting is the number of times your heart beats per minute while you are at rest\nNot moving not anything else\nIt's an indicator of physical fitness\nOkay All right\nAs you're resting heart rate will decrease\nA ... ... so accurate explained as\nAs you're resting heart rate decreases as your as your ... your heart and as your heart become stronger with aerobic training or you have better\nResting heart rate and this is often used in um sports uh you see people when they are runners right they ... there'll be running and then they stop and then they take that their paws or to see what their pulses\nNormal resting heart rate a normal has a hell of a normal healthy resting heart rate for adults is sixty to eighty be PM\nBeats per minute what was his sixty seven\nOkay it was it Ninety Seventy started walking right nice talking to your my uh started walking in a fasting okay so he he\nImproved adults with a high level of fitness have a resting heart rate below sixty below sixty\nAnd some elite endurance athletes can they even have a ... a resting heart rate up already\nSo the lower the more fit\nI mean you understand mhm an average adult resting heart rate is sixty to two one hundred beats per minute\nBut the higher end of this ranges associate with increased health risk including metabolic syndrome was your friend overweight yeah he was yeah uh-huh exactly an elevated resting heart rate up eighty beats per minute in higher can be an indicator of increased what cardiovascular risk and other words\nUh your heart is\nMaybe having to work too hard you could have apple is gross is the arteries are clogged you could happen in large part because I have about problem could be any number of things and it increases or a high resting heart raised an indicator of what mortality you increase the risk for all cause mortality\nThis is according to the ... the research that I'm not making it up the risk is most pronounced when the resting heart rate goes above Ninety beats per minute that means you're in trouble\nAnd when he started did he start walking or anything like that how you started he started off with two miles now he's at six today [noise]\n\nHis cardio respiratory fitness just what I was talking about improved his resting heart rate\nAnd I suspect that his base or metabolic rate improved as well\nTurns out that resting heart rate you asked a good question because resting heart weight varies by by gender\nAs women tend to have what smaller hearts and lower blood volume and hemoglobin let's seem a globe so the heart needs to be more frequently to nourish the cells and tissues and organs\nInteresting mhm average resting heart rate will change as you age\nBeing much faster in infants and a lot slower in adulthood the average rage change a average change ranges also change slightly as I said as you move

[noise] downloaded now\n\nSo since then more plaintiffs including cancer patients their spouses or there are states have sued Monsanto making similar claims so you can see why Monsanto\nIs trying to push back on this very hard is open the floodgates um or used to\nBe Monsanto what are they calling it now I Wonder just bear I don't know what they're calling it\nUm so anyway\nMr Johnson ended up with two hundred and eighty nine my eighty nine million dollars Mr Johnson's attorney and Mr Timothy Lynchburg\nSays it won't change the fact that ah Johnson's two sons might lose their dad soon a but it may help him live more comfortably oh that is most likely and the lawyers as well\nThey get forty percent [laughter] as as of right now they haven't come up with a new name for the company okay [laughter] um [noise] Mr Johnson\nWho's forty six years old is a nice looking man\nRound up weed killer twenty to thirty times per year\n\nAt while working on the grounds for a school district near San Francisco\nHe testified ah that during his work he had two incidences which she was soaked with the product the first time that happened in twenty fourteen and then\nTwo years later it happened again where the city was make wearing leak or something happened what wrong\n\nOr Mr Johnson's pretty sick\nOn bad days he's too even too crippled speak\nOkay a\nHe has lesions over eighty percent of his body there there are horrific Gary showed them earlier I it it's heartbreaking\nNow let me tell you this round up\nHas martialed the science and they did this in court they cited scores of studies that say roundup does not cause cancer\nAnd ah they\nThe one lawyer for Monsanto's said more than eight hundred scientific studies\nThe U.S eat PA the national institutes of health and regulators around the world have concluded that lie so fat guy post site is safe for use and does not cause cancer said Mr Partridge Monsanto's vice president of strategy\nHe cited he highlighted the agricultural health study which studied the effects of pesticides and lipids that products on farms [noise] on farmers and their spouses from Nineteen Ninety three to twenty Thirteen decided that study\nAnd you know\nThe summer of that study was quote no association was apparent between ... and any solid tumors or limb Boyd malignancy is overall including non Hodgkin's lymphoma closed quote\nMr ... said quote we all have sympathy for Mr Johnson it's natural he's looking for answers ... sad is not the answer was quote well let me tell you something about Mr Partridge I Know a thing or two about juries I was ... jury consulting\nYou can cite all those studies all you want all day long\nJuries are everyday people jurors are everyday people what they did out I'm not a bad job I'll bet job or a Starbucks Coffee they sat in that jury room and they looked at the narrative that the that the plane to presented in court\nWhat was the story I I didn't attend but I'm going to bet you this one of the themes was the only thing and Mr Johnson's life that was very different from anything else he ever did was using that spray\nThese lesions all over his body the non Hodgkin's lymphoma the had didn't come out of the ether\nAnd that jury not withstanding all the science about life was that not being cancerous decided that it was because they were using their common sense\n\nThey were using their common sense at the end of the day tell you a thing or two a by I\nTell lawyers this all the time that it's all about the narrative do the jurors believe the story what's the story what's the narrative of the case\nAnd that that was a compelling narrative and they believe Mr Johnson got cancer from using that product\n\nThe defense the plaintiffs attorney says it's not life was set by itself it's quite posts at acting synergistic leave with other chemical\nCompounds in the product of course Monsanto push back on that argument as well if\nI were sitting on that jury I Would have probably if I Am from Mr Johnson as well\nThey probably didn't put any scientist I don't know maybe they did if I was doing the jury selection maybe I Would have put a scientist on there and said you know a hardcore scientist\nOr an engineer engineers like all the columns to line up with an injury was probably might look at those date and say these are the data the science says it doesn't cause cancer you know somebody with a scientific mind so making the jury for that case would be interesting\nYeah I Would have probably look for all hardcore scientist and that jury pool\nSomebody whose data driven\nRight defined for Monsanto if I was one of Monsanto's lawyers if I was a if I was a trial consultant for the plaintiff I Would keep those kind of people off the jury [laughter] [noise]\nYou know it's interesting there's scientist says that ... sat by itself is not cause cancer [noise]\nJury didn't believe it I guess what you say so much for science I get a [noise]\nAs a
