is that that worst ah it's horrible horrible and I saw something even more outrageous and the traffic or when we got off the bridge and the freeway that goes past the airport\nThere was a best buy with two people writing it without a helmet on\nOn the best book in the fast lane and are the best book maybe go thirty five miles an hour tops right ...\n... before that the craziest thing I've ever seen in my travels on the road was under the Atlanta beltway\nThere was a woman eating a bowl of soup ... with a spoon and she was holding the bowl and the other hand and she was steering with their legs in the fashion or niece her knees but this to this couple are wearing swimsuit out on a basketball and the ...\nThey were wondering if they were going to the beach yeah road takes you out to ... yeah [noise]\nNo ... you know they're just not using their head and they're that they're putting themselves in danger in peril their life and others and\nIt's just what happens is traffic here is horrible horrible but you've been traveling or as as usual around the world we got a they've got to find out where you been um I Know you're out here but I'm going to hazard a guess that\nThere were three at least three or four other stops before you got to Tampa right and [laughter]\nAnd I have to keep on the move on on this particular trip I was in Baltimore and then went to um the consumer product health industry a show and it was in Madrid the sheer rotates around different cities that's the largest uh health a product a show in Europe I they said it had to close to a hundred thousand a participant\nSo she's at a crippling to our expo east and west kinds of shows are\nVery very similar a design it's a little bit more um a suit and tie pharmaceutical only really where the uh expo um West is more my kind of people uh yeah I'm\nA but um and then then I went to the home office in a ... Belgium I always enjoyed that and I had to go to Manchester I had never been there England in England ... I'd only seen it on soccer on TV for\nSaw so there's quite a trip so you ... you started off in where do you live in Indiana\nI I live in the on the ... or in rural Maryland\nHi Marilyn seeing what the Baltimore Baltimore to Madrid ... right if if Madrid to dent Belgium dent to Manchester, England in Manchester, England to Tampa, Florida\nOrlando Orlando while at a and I'm I've been traveling with your friend I'm\nThey they tend to sit down and eat or where I think most Americans eat at least one a meal in their car or an often eat two or three meals in their car\nThey uh they drink their coffee at the coffee shop before or getting in the car driving to work\nIn Madrid as an example of the legal to drive with coffee or in the car no yeah they um they make all the uh um the taxis aren't allowed to carry people with a coffee cup um in there it's a they can get stopped and find by the police are in um\nWhen it if you're a passenger in a car can you drink coffee\nThough the taxi driver told me that in Madrid uh it was it legal or for for ... for him to have any passenger in the car or with um with the beverage\nWith with coffee or any beverage\nIn ... I had a cup of coffee yeah it was early in the morning and I'm a yeah he told me I had to pour it out or said he could get fined\nMaybe he didn't like the way I looked it made it up [laughter] that was the first time I had heard of that\nBut um I I I generally find the people ah each slower or the um the heat or less I'm a ... each plate they smaller and um ah they they take more time a out of their day to a ... as as part of the eating process\nAnd I I think when we're in a rush we we eat here in the states we eat fast it interferes with the way I'm the or body communicates with our brain that it's full it ... we tend to eat more because of that\n... that's interesting um\nSo you do see differences than in way people conduct comport themselves in day to day life\nYeah absolutely it it's it's generally with the um uh ... the process of or on the way to work they they stop a often will stop somewhere or meet with some friends\nAre they um they take lunch it's where they they leave the office in um a chat about something other than their work\nAnd then they um they they seem to be more active in the evening a lot of places I go as well\n... do you notice that do they eat a in a in a schedule\nThat we have in this country you know breakfast noon lunch dinner five six o'clock and they are or they do that differently\nThere there was a great deal of variation between the times people eat in the er the ... what about in Europe\nUm in in a in some places like in Spain they eat a big meal in the later afternoon sometimes it takes them to ours ah ah and then they'll have um a dinner very very late if you show up at a Spanish restaurant at eight thirty the wait staff might not be there yet\nWe're in the U.S at the ... it's fashionable time to time\nBut in other places I go oh they they eat were like six o'clock or ... or ... I've always been a fan of that have a breakfast like a king and lunch like a queen and dinner like a ... a type approach yeah and a guy professor or I'm Bill Judy ... a stress to me that the uh\nThe the most um leaned culture generally went to bed hungry\nOr in ... I I've always use that when I find wait a sneaking up on me I I find it most effective to cut back or the the late meal people\nWith me about that do in Spain in Spain you're saying that they eat dinner they have a big meal in the middle of the afternoon then dinner late at night later and that much later that's\nCorrect but that's not typical for Europe as a whole my I I feel that in most of the European countries the the people are eating six thirty seven o'clock rush\nWow I Know in Italy a in the afternoon everything after twelve around one o'clock everything shuts down for the afternoon for about two or three hours and then the shops and will reopen\nRight around for wherever and then you have dinner around eight eight thirty\nThat that they shut things down I mean there's like a C esta right\nVery similar in Spain or Italy and Vilonia we have a distributor in Vilonia\nAnd do they go to coffee shops in the morning and sometimes don't get to work till ten or they they read the paper and talk to their friends and I think it's a quite a healthy way of living if you can figure out how to do it here here in the U.S I Believe we we all have to look down on that kind of behavior\nAnd a um we think we have to work all the time and if we're not in the office early and um uh we we feel guilty but um I they they seem to be as just as productive as people here\nThat's interesting isn't it they managed to get work done they they're they're they're not\nAs obsessed with work but yet get work done and I understand that vacations or in some of these countries people were given for six weeks vacation\nI think it's a very good system and most of the European countries have given three or four weeks off in the summer and they all take vacation at once so they can really relax other companies shut down and then they get another two or three weeks off in the around the turn of the year at Christmas Time [noise]\nMan [noise]\nJeeze so there are there are distinct differences then yes absolutely those are some of the positive things I Do I see I I think that they do [noise] mhm [noise]\nWell we're here to learn a I'm a I'm always intrigued with what do other

what I wanted to share with you before we get back to Richard ... which got me to thinking\nAnd it's been on my mind for a couple of days do you share with you and that in a today is the nineteenth\nThis is the very day two years ago where I was diagnosed with a two hits of different cancer on this day\nAnd uh it's been a long journey\nI can tell you and the journey continues I'm not a hundred percent that is the truth I I have two things are different\nYou do things differently you see the world differently you're trying to piece yourself back together again I'm Still in that process it's it's quite a formidable challenge I Know many of you are familiar with that challenge I Know that whether it be cancer or some other health issue and you know what it's like\nBut\nOne of the things that really has resonated and come to the surface for me through all of this\n... among a number of things one to live mindfully\nTo live in the moment and to live in a ... with mindfulness and to and not to keep thinking about tomorrow the next day the next day in a way out way out way out but to be here in the moment\nAnd to put you into embraced the moment and to take things one day at a time\nAnd that's\nWhat I've been doing and uh that that seems to help another thing that has surfaced in this journey is living with purpose and having a purpose in life are there is research\nIn fact to support this whole notion of living with purpose I Know that back in twenty Seventeen I I think I even reported on to study a study that was published in the journal the American association psychiatry that journal\nAnd that living with purpose made a difference main two main you know having a purpose in life may help people they were reporting maintain their function their independence
