A. R. N. A. and all of that you know genetics proteins are implicated right in the it's it's all about the proteins\nOr so we have these proteins here that we can the body can make which are non essential but then you have nine essential amino acids that must be essential to get them from your diet because your body does not synthesized them\nAnd so you can see if you're deficient in if your diet is deficient\nOr not only were you not get these important essential amino acids but there may be other nutrients that your family to get so that's why we say around here and nutrition is the first principle of health\nSo the the product is designed for cold and flu season to boost the immune system not just cold and flu season but to support your immune system\nCorrect it is designed to support the immune system is designed you know and the two options we've got the capsule and the trouble but you know with owner very we see a lot of that in stores today especially this time of year focused on elder Barry which is actually assembled history\nSo that has the research that shows that does support the immune system and that it could reduce the duration of colds and flus\nPlus there's probably females in elder berry itself those are powerful antioxidants and we know we need antioxidants to help offset all the free radicals that are running around in our body just from breathing we create free radicals from breathing\nSo we've got the life you know that amino acid and sometimes when we say protein people forget that really protein is made up of amino acids\nAnd it's those very specialized amino acids that are the building blocks of the body and the essential ones are essential because they're kind of like the foundation of how we build\nThe building called our human body and so with the life seeing an elder bury those two\nGreat research to show it helps with immune system and then vitamin D I mean we know we're chronically deficient in vitamin D we've had conversations about that before [noise] there's not a lot of vitamin D and here this is not to help build your vitamin D blood levels but it's a supportive component of the product there's\nFour hundred I use of vitamin D in the serving in the capsules are three servings and the two of those are two tablets\nAs again they have the four hundred I knew a vitamin D they have a little bit less lysine in them\nThe life you might have a bitter taste to them so these are more of that tank a very orange type taste to them and those are two tablets so you can take four tablets if you need to get what you're going to get in the very capsules\nSo it's very easy to do is very easy to take and take it you know however is going to be best suited to your lifestyle\nSo with the vitamin D added in there and we know that vitamin D is also important for immune and to regulate cell production so the whole combination of the lysine elder berry and the vitamin D", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Let's Talk Nutrition", "city": "Tampa", "day": "29"}
