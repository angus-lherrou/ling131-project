Michael dark out\nTo that Fox nutrition thanks for stopping by today [noise]\nOne of the things that has become very clear to me\nIn producing an hosting the show for third Thirteen Years little sue being fourteen [noise] is that when it comes to matters of health and people's lives being put at risk\n\nAnd the potential to die from an illness a you immediately learn that how people cope with that or aren't able to cope\nAnd one of the things that people will reach for in moments like that is they reach for a higher order\nGod to be specific\nI Know I did and still do every day and as I described a my challenges\nWhich were life threatening I described it as cosmetically humbling that was the language I used the phrase and it has been and I use that phrase for two reasons one to capture the enormity\nOf what was going on with me in second was a reference to a higher order\n\nAnd I said it was it and it still remains cosmetically humbling I tell you that in without any embarrassment\nOr a no compunction I'm being totally open I Can't be I Am wide open here I bring this up because\nI'm On Tuesday a Stephen Hawking book\nFinal book came out\nYeah Stephen Hawking is the famous a scientist and that you all know of who I Am sure and you know he had severely um impaired in a wheelchair you know you know who I Am referring to now I'm sure you do\nBrilliant\nBrilliant scientist and I'm a marketable person no doubt by all accounts well in\nThe book he says there is no God\n\nThat's the conclusion of this very prestigious celebrated highly respected physicist\nWhose final book is published was published on Tuesday\n\nThe book was completed by family members after he passed away he's gone I didn't mention any presents answers to the questions that hocking said he received the most during his time on earth ...\n\nThere were other bomb shells this British scientist left the readers with include the belief that alien life is does exist and is out there in space\n\nArtificial ... he's artificial intelligence good outsmart humans he believes we believe in time travel cannot be ruled out now\nI just think about this for a second thing about who's saying that this is not some guy who's had a few too many down at the drop in\nOkay this is a brilliant off smart off the chain physicist\nWho must have devoted thousands and thousands of hours no doubt thinking about these issues and writing about them talking about them\n\nIs considered one of the most brilliant scientists of his generation he passed away back in March he was Seventy six years old\nHere's a quote from the book there is no God no one directs the universe\n\nThe book is titled brief answers to the big questions drinking you got a response to that [laughter] oh\nOkay so I recently started going back to church and one of the things that I I mean I Believe there's a God I Believe there's something else out there besides me I think I think our energy goes somewhere mhm\nWhat he says further for centuries it was believed that disabled people like me were living under a curse that was inflicted by God he said\nHe said quote I prefer to think that everything can be explained another way by the laws of nature close quote\nHer I said you know I Wonder what got him to the place where he reached this conclusion that there is no God\nAnd he he does believe in the laws of nature that we are guided and uh that it is the laws of nature that are guiding and our over arching\n\nIt is it is provocative and why do I bring it up because in matters of health\nUh and again what I said to you is something I've learned over these years now during the show is that people will reach to a higher order almost in out of instinct when confronted with the help challenge\nOr life threatening health challenge for sure especially\nAnd cause for whatever reason it's ... it's instinctive it's the\nSeems to me I've seen it many times and physicians who listen to the show and\nHealthcare providers nurses doctors and ... whomever have witnessed it is may as well as you most likely have to in your own life close family member or friend\n\nUm\n[noise] you know having faith being a fate that is very ... that is a very important component to health wellness in wellbeing\n\nAnd for Stephen Hawking to um this was a ... he was disabled he had a Las\n... ... ... ... lateral sclerosis confined to a wheelchair\nOr so it was not as if he didn't understand suffering is not as if he was some spoiled you know\nSelf absorbed individual who didn't care about others [noise] he used his brain to help us understand our position in place in the cosmos and on the surface\n\nI don't know if I agree with him about there is no God\n\nWhy is there something and not nothing but as all I Know is that I\nI don't think you can talk about health well and and I don't talk much about God on the show because\nThat borders it starts to filter into the world of religion and I don't do that on the show no talk about politics I don't talk about religion\nBut\nI don't know how you can carry on a conversation about health wellness and well being and sooner or later\nAnd I guess this moment has arrived at least for this show where the notion of a higher order or God comes part of the conversation and I don't speak of it in religious terms I speak up it just generally\nDoesn't have to be tied to any particular denomination of face\nBut I think it's an important concept and not for me for me personally um it has been useful and has been guiding and I pray on every single day you have no idea\nUm I Do and I just\nI just I don't know why maybe it's because of my upbringing or I don't know but when you're ... again when you're confronted when you're up against the wall and everything is on the line\nOut of a least out of instinct if not out of practice one will reach for a higher order here's a number to call for you have a comment about this\nYou can reach us at eight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five that's eight seven seven eight nine seven talk\nAnd the other thing I've learned over these on the nineteenth of this month that's what three days from now you sir that was when I was diagnosed two years ago on the nineteenth of this month\nAnd since that time the world has changed and so have I have changed and so have I and I think I Would like to think for the better\nFor the most part and uh I've learned a lot and it has been a guiding for me and so uh\nWe're all and the other the thing one of the things I've learned as we're all in this together\nAnd that is part of health as part of our wellness\nBy the way I'm One of the final set lines of in hocking book [noise]\nHe says remember to look up look up to look up to

H. O. poison control center\nAnd in his opinion based on their experience of looking at the world of adverse effects associate with herbal products he said that very seldom do we get serious adverse effects associated with products that are made for example in developed countries so\nMost adverse effects of herbal products because people are starving and have to go eat poison plant over right oh that's that's not a toxic effect associated with the herbal medicine\nThat's us an adverse effect associated with having to eat toxic plants for example in times of starvation and then there are also adverse effects that occur when like traditional ... or healers might give the wrong gr\nBut very seldom did they find adverse effects associated with supplement type product those that are made by modern good manufacturing she of peas and things like that very rare but\nThat's not the case with a pharmaceuticals there isn't it there's a stunning statistic associated with pharmaceuticals you want to share that\n[laughter] yeah that's the context that you have to place the conversation a verb safety it is a\nWorldwide you might have a few hundred people a year worldwide\nWho died because of an adverse effect associate with our product some people might think that's a lot but you compare that against pharmaceuticals medications which kill literally more than four hundred thousand people every year just in the United states\nAnd that that means more people are dying because of the pharmaceutical medications that they take that die from cigarettes figure that out\n... [laughter]\nI I mean you can't make that up rather a ... I don't you know I've heard those numbers before and every time and I say well well then why do they continue to do it while they continue to do it because there's a demand for it I guess right\nThey don't know what else to do Michel ... like a German the urban physicians they know that they can reduce the drug use by integrating herbal medicine into their protocols and so that's how they do it that's one way that they do is\nWe ... we haven't caught on me I'm ... years we haven't caught on to that yet here have we\nOnly integrated medical doctors you know some some integrated medical doctors like an angel while or Deepak Chopra deed or dish people like that\nHave integrated these concepts of their personal practices and they teach other physicians about it but it really hasn't caught on and mainstream now that that that's a shame of it because there's tremendous benefit to be had", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Let's Talk Nutrition", "city": "Tampa", "day": "17"}
