I found the study and I was looking\nAt it and um I again I\nI can tell you as a researcher there are a lot of pitfalls associate with meta analyses you got to be very very careful\nWhen you're doing those kinds of studies and when you are interpreting the findings from those studies you got to look for the biopsies there's selection bias that can happen uh information bias of different forms of information biased selection bias can happen\nI just got to be very careful that's all say about it because I don't want to get through tactical but\nA vitamin D three should not stopped taking your vitamin D there's this new study says that\nAh it doesn't help with bone health really I'm not so um\nSo what what do you have to say further about it\n[noise] well well supplementing does not predict vitamin D levels when you have\nTo look at other factors such as absorption are you taking it with a meal containing fat\nOr the the forum you're taking and the measurement you're taking because uh you know that can affect that if they're doing blood levels which in most cases there they were not\nSo they're they're really not screening all the variables if ... if you have a very low vitamin D level and you take a four hundred units capsule for example you would not expect to budge your level very quickly\nAnd you you would still be very low for a long time 'cause you're taking a maintenance does but you're maintaining a low level I see\nSo you know knowing that does is important knowing the blood levels and knowing how it affects the doses important die of studies showing it takes a thousands of international units to start moving if you look at a cafe or a curve a graph\nAnd trying to rapidly raised vitamin D levels you need five to ten thousand units typically are higher to start budgeting it up very sharply instead of very low and gradually\nSo what's the duration of the study how much were they giving that they look at dietary intake that they look at blood levels which are really the most important thing to predict how much vitamin D you have not supplementation\n... eight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five eight seven seven eight nine seven talk\nI'm I was just involved at the past week\nOr doing a lot of work on a bias in research selection bias and information buys those two major categories and so this is at the top of my mind I'm ... you brought it up give me a chance to at least share a couple of thoughts about this notion of\nScience in these studies all kinds of studies whether it's a randomized control trial whether it's a case study a cohort study a case control study um any kind of epidemiological study\nOr you're always worry about bias\nYou worry about how the sample was drawn you worry about the assignment of people into groups you worry about um the way things are being measured a in a study there's so many opportunities for bias due to enter into the picture\nA so I'm just saying you know science just because the study was done doesn't mean that it's the end all be all and that was it's bulletproof it's not it's not as it's\nDone by humans and that makes it that's that's what becomes the the issue so I ...\nThe part of it is a bias though of of training because or ignorance really because if they don't understand that serum levels are more important than supplementation if they don't understand that ... that the only way you're getting vitamin D\nAnd they'd love looking at studies with that view point they've got blinders on they don't understand the topic they're not competent to design a study yet here they are with the study that's getting international news\nAbsolutely eight seven seven eight nine seven eight to five five eight seven seven eight nine seven talk a at now foods um okay so what do you have to offer it in your repertoire on vitamin D for the consumer", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Let's Talk Nutrition", "city": "Tampa", "day": "18"}
