[noise]\nYes doctor every time I see they are on a pesticides on a sec I Wonder about the whole thing what upsets me the most is false advertising is the thing the tricks they play on the on the ... the grocery store and I fallen for myself they have these these buzz words like\nA whole grain and they put that in big letters on the box but then you get home and look at the ingredients and it's got a lot of other things another one that I used in big letters says no trans fats [noise] you know ... or no MSG so you're\nGoing down the aisle you see these things it's like oh I you know to claim product now it's clean and that one respect but then you look at the back of it and that's you know the the the same old or a artificial flavors and and and colors um\nThere was something that came out by the F ... of the day though they outlawed four or five or\nA colors but you know as well as I Do they'll they'll just change the formula a little bit and ah\nYou know there'll be back in the product yeah\nIt's like you know a bank robber geysers I go to church every\nSunday but but what you don't know about him he's a bank robber see just see the the church part yeah many of these products will seduce you like that they they tell you what the the good the good news is about the product but they don't focus on the bad news and the product and consumers have to be more\nMore critical in the way they purchase these products now although I must say\nUh somebody's grocery stores now I've walked in and I feel like I'm In a library people standing in the hour reading labels and I think that's a good thing\nI'm more you know careful on what their purchasing I liked that idea but you're right the and they can label these things in a way that they're still legal in the way they label them but it can be misleading\nAnd if you're not careful you can end up buying something that you should probably be consuming all these different dies a preservatives fillers and whatever they're using I mean as\nThese you have to understand that these food companies have food scientists and chemists and what not working for them by the probably hundreds\nAnd that's all they do all day uh they figure out how to make these products using these chemicals and get this to market it in a way that still appealing to the consumer it's crazy\nSo I but I appreciate your [noise] uh I I\nHaven't seen the ... well I I I don't know Gary we need to get a a a a very current um\nJune fourth day changed names permanently they did mhm that was the top story All right\nUm but right now is Monsanto no longer the name pope it's barren now Monsanto doesn't exist\nNope spare okay that's what I'm saying when I went to the feed store the other day all the product labels were changed really yeah I'll take a picture of when I get home tonight show you\nThis I Know this happened back in June that I Know right yes that everything that I read is dated June\nSo this is in effect bearable remained the company name bears set in a statement mode Monsanto will no longer be a company name I take them at their word so I I guess Monsanto was gone\nThis is interesting that doesn't mean though to\nKnow round up is still round up isn't it\nYeah I just checked that [laughter] that's funny 'cause that's what I was just checking it still round up right\n\nChanging the name I guess there's been you got to remember that um didn't Monsanto make Agent Orange yes\nAll right in GMO modified corn for um a corner industry okay so over the years\n\nNow and if would they um the flu with influenza there is a very ... flu strain was it's H. three and two that rascal rampage that's all across the country last year eighty thousand people die man\nA hundred and fifty three children I think it was\nAmong those\nIs it was a horrible ... a year last year the worst in forty years\nA doctor dissolves said flu spreads from person to ... per person by bars bearing moisture droplets that an infected person ... cops or sneezes out\nWe all know this this creates what you can think of as a moving cloud of risk around an infected individual\nHe went on to say this is an interesting science point during the winter you mitigate decreases this is true\nAnd this decreasing humidity wall wow the virus than to remain more virulent and viable\nIn the air for a longer period of time which affective lakes bands that cloud of risk that he's talking about\nI'm thinking of like what is it the nuts yes [laughter] it's a big fan big fan and pig pens got that cloud you know the cloud of dust while you got a cloud of\nThese might these a microbial threats [laughter] all around you you're on a subway\nMy God it's so it's an ... or on a plane on a bus on a train right\nThe first thing I Do and we travel just take a shower soon as I get to the hotel or to the house I I take a shower\nYou might have to burn your clothes what are you talking about [laughter]\nYeah Dr dissolves dissolves said if an infected person sitting right beside you it matters less what the specific humidity is if it helps the virus fine to host evil one climate climatic conditions are not at their most favorable\nIt still helps the bars it's proximity there looking I said this yesterday I said at last week I'll continue to tell you we are a host these viruses\nThey're looking for a host\nDoctor or does yeah and his colleagues combined six years of data\nIt was reported in the Baltimore Sun on influence influenza cases would census data showing where people live and work in six hundred and three different US cities and the bigger the city a more viable and very all of these viruses apparently behave\n\nLarge metropolitan areas flu cases are spread more spread out including early and late in the season when weather is not at the ... is not the best for transmission\n\nNew York city in Miami or are examples of cities they reported that having more pro long flu season\nIs interesting\nOn the other hand smaller cities tend to have a shorter flu season where um you know the flu seasons are tightly grouped around the usual peak [laughter] pardon me in winter Atlanta Nashville are examples of this\nA phenomenon that kind of behavior in terms of the bars where the flu hits during a more concentrated period is what I'm trying to tell you\nSo where you live makes a difference\nIn the ... in your odds of getting sick or otherwise being infected with a cold or flu virus\n... I've never reported that before um\nStevens going to be on here and a little bit calling in from South Africa it's it's about a six hour difference something like that yeah it's in the afternoon there uh he's got to be talking about something that may help with flu season cold and flu season we're in the middle of it right now\nCold and flu\nSo if you're under a lot of stress you're not getting enough sleep and rest you're not eating right you're not exercising you're sitting target man and ... and you live in a big city and you're commuting\n...\nAnd other experts that influenza in large cities behave differently with longer transmission chains pro long seasons and less vulnerability to changes in humidity versus smaller cities\n[noise] this study underscores the need for pandemic preparedness I should say [noise]\nI Wonder what it's like in Hong Kong and some of these Asian cities\nWhere I mean you've got\nHundreds of thousands of people collected and millions in one small space I must be\nWe should check that I'll bet I'll bet it's worse than and those are going to keep me from Trump\n[laughter] [noise]\nSo where you live makes a difference here large metropolitan areas where you're commuting lots of people [noise]\n[noise]\nOh we're trying to help you [noise]\nSo I guess you if you lived in a shack in the woods you're okay or I don't know you are [laughter] as scary you're living [laughter] I I don't know what's wrong with this war like his dad would say Gary\nSon your afflicted [laughter] that Moore's afflicted you need to move into the city man get the flu what's the matter with you you are listening to talk to your church nationally\nSyndicated globally stream buyers free I Hope I'm\nEnergy energy and more energy everyone needs and find did you know you can get the energy uni Clinton said the Paris while forest extracts\nWild ... for secret source of energy and power from Russian athletes years ago making them I'm ... now you can exchange real energy and power like you've never dream possible while ... that is the world's top source an SAT\nIraq Disney haze that critical and then that blocks the aging process and keeps you sound how in the\nWild very extract gives the world's top so it's a ... and natural hair on needed my every found the body\nAnd how the thousand in a healthy you hand them more powerful and Tim Zagat branch back is also good for your high how the cholesterol and even helps build housing arteries no wonder it's known as ... said take your time to charge the wild bunch by every day in China max capsules from North American urban face and get that ...\nPower job be famous and not going to be made in medicine got human association these products and not and came to diagnose and treat your or prevent any disease\nA country like vitamins we've been helping people live happy\nHealthy lives since Nineteen Seventy one and we believe integrity should always be our number one ingredient we're committed to this belief because you deserve high quality nutrition specifically\nCrowded with the highest standards to support your health a country like manufacturing facility is an NFL GM be registered facility as well as USDA's certified organic so you can feel good about the products you're taking a country like vitamins is also the verse supplement company in the United states do have a ... line of products certified gluten\nFree that's over five hundred brought a country like vitamins pledge of integrity is based on my standards authenticity one lean is Russian and consistency inaccuracy\nAs for country lives up selling products such as co enzyme be advanced for increased energy more or less stable for joined ... vitamins commitment to ensure all of our products or be your wholesome gluten free supplements full of natural goodness provides peace of mind with the knowledge you are using a brand you can trust\nThe proceeding was a commercial program paid for by let's talk nutrition L.
