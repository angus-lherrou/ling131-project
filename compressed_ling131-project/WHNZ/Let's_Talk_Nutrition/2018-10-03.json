Dr Michael dark out\nThere's a new report out by the CDC talking about bad fast food consumption uh among adults in the United states it looked it up period from twenty Thirteen\nTo twenty sixteen\nAnd have some interesting um interesting data here interesting findings so here's a question among adults\nWho reported consuming fast food\nDid the percentage vary by meal type\n\nAnswer is yes so here's my question among adults you consume fast food the most commonly reported eating occasions were was at lunch dinner breakfast or snacks\nWhat do you think\nWhen when one meal or most people eating fast food lunch dinner breakfast or snacks\n[noise] I Wanna say lunch okay\nYour first you're usually the first response you should stick with it it you're right it's lunch forty three point seven percent however\nThere wasn't that much difference for dinner forty two percent [laughter] and then that was followed by breakfast about twenty three percent eat fast food for breakfast and twenty three percent twenty three percent twenty two point six or consume it and snacks\nOkay is it men or women that consume fast food during lunch\nThe highest did men eat more fast food for lunch or did women\nWhat's your what's your answer when thinking men you're right forty eight point three percent compared to thirty nine point one percent with the higher percentage of women than men consumed fast food from snacks women apparently like the snacks more so than the men\nKind of different\nThirty seven percent of adults consumed fast food on any given day they that's the overall finding a overall percentage of adults who consume fast food decreased with age\nIncrease with income and was higher among his non Hispanic black person's compared with other race and his spare Hispanic origin groups\nFurther more a higher percentage of non Hispanic White adults get soon fat\nConsume fast food than did non Hispanic Asian adults\n\nThey said further that among men and women who consume fast food a higher percentage of men aged for lunch while higher percentage of women ate it as a snack\n\nNow eating fast food lead you down the road to doing what you're gonna eat more salt sugar and fat have higher calories\nAnd if it becomes an integral part of your diet\nIt's going to eventually took a toll on your health no doubt about it\nSo that's fast food consumption wow so what do we do about that\nIn the and the answer is at first it you know they're [laughter] what is the answer how do we change it how do we change the food culture in this country\nWell it is through education and the target audience are young children healthy young children that's the target audience\nThis well this this took about three or four decades to really ... for the technical to really be gripped in to the culture\nStarted before that but and then the last three or four decades but was when we really have started to see a downturn in health among children especially\n\nAnd that's what that's the that's the road to change here and it's all along is going to be a long challenging road\n\nAnd I've said more than a few times on air that nutrition\nCourses have to become and lifestyle diet lifestyle whatever however they want to frame it have to become courses that become intro go to the curriculum in school\n\nI Wonder what we're going to say when we have right now it's about Eighteen percent or maybe Nineteen percent of children adolescents that are obese twenty five percent a little bit out of the points have gone up a little bit\nAre overweight and obese what are we going to say when fifty percent of adolescent children are overweight or obese\n\nThe reason one theory is that we get so habituated and hard to change routines because the brain doesn't want to keep learning new stuff because it's busy\n\nIf you could imagine if the brain had to um keep learning like in you get up in the morning you have a routine\nIf the brain had to deal with and it's an ever changing different routine every morning it would be that would be taxed\nAnd if you think about that throughout the day much of what we do is very ... very habituated that's the brains way of saving time\nThat's an evolutionary a feature it looks like we selected for that\n\nYou'll find yourself sometimes leaving the house getting to work and you can't even remember how you got there but you're so habituated you get there\nRight how come I can remember lyrics from songs from the eighties but I Can't remember what I did my car cats a different issue [laughter]\nThat's a different issue [laughter] but I'm not the only person right now that's like that's a that's a\nMemory issued this ... this is a memory issue but of a different sort the brain is programmed to because if you think about all of that has to do is responsible for every single chemical reaction in your body\nIt's constantly working when you think of the seat that the CPU man\nAnd if it has to keep learning new things all the time that it can root nice it's not going to be able to attend it's going to make it harder it's going to get you know the wires are going to burn up\nSo to speak if you follow my my metaphor yeah yeah so that's why we're so that's one theory it makes sense\nWould would you what brain protocol would you use 'em for a cause I'm forty four ... I'm learning that I'm like the keys things so what would you recommend\nI Would recommend Charles Duhigg book I'm telling you it's called the power to have a power of habit there\nAre certain you you don't change habits you have to replace the habit\nAnd there are triggers that will cause you to behave in certain ways and those you got to know what the triggers are and the book is I'm telling you the book is worth to read\nUm\nIt it it has to make\nAll kinds of the brave enough to make all kinds of decisions all day long and if it's constantly bombarded with new things that you just to get you through the day it's going to have a hard time\nSo it it's going to try to make as much of your life automatic as possible in other words habituated\n\n... I was looking for quote from the book uh that would [noise]\nThere's the the routine is the behavior just got to remember that that's the behavior why do you okay I think about it why do you continually\nWhen you you know that you shouldn't buy that box of doughnuts would you're at the grocery store you know that or that box of this or that or whatever that you know but yet it ends up in the cart what's the trigger\nWhy do you keep putting it in the car even though you start even before you went into the store or that day you were thinking about or whenever I Need the quit buying that food but yet it ends still ends up in the car and then in your mouth\n\nDuly gloss explain that and talk about the triggers and he'd give a breaks it down it it makes eminently good sense\nAnd then gives you things to to practice and you'll start to see\nHow you how we do get habituated like I I Am very careful\nBecause I Know how the brain works when I'm working I work at a certain place at I bought my environment my war I study where I Do my writing that in that the space that desk or the table that I'm working on\nI have to have I put things in a certain position everything's placed there in the ... all the same way every time I make that I consciously habituate myself\n... so I stay organized [noise]\nAnd I have to have things set up so that I Can't have a lot of chaos so I ... I ... try to come into my house Gary will tell you things are very organized at that's way I\nI have ... to myself to do that because I function better that way\nWhen I'm studying and I'm working I Do at the same way every time all the time by intention\nBecause I I Want my I Want it to be automatic\nThat's what athletes do that's what musicians do that's what dancers do that's why they practice they practice the way you practice is the way you perform the way you practice is the way you perform [noise]\nSo every day is practice you have to keep practicing a certain way so that you end up performing in a way that's good for you but you ... you have practice you're practicing these\nHabits and you're practicing in a bad way and so you you keep reinforcing the same bad thing you just gotta learn what the triggers are and how to replace him [noise]\nEnergy energy and more energy everyone needs and what did you know you can get the energy uni Clinton it's in the powers of wild forest extracts while John ... for secret source of energy and power for Russian athletes\nYears ago making them unbeatable now you can exchange real energy and power and like he never dream possible while ... is the world's top source an SAT around Disney case that critical and then that blocks the aging process and keep yourself healthy wildfires extract gives the world's top so it's a ... and natural\nStare on needed by every found the body and how the thousand in a healthy\nYou hand them more powerful and Tim Zagat branch back is also good for your heart healthy cholesterol and even helps ... no wonder it's known as ... said take your time to charge the wild bunch by every day and China max capsules from North American urban fights and get that ...\nAs saga power jobs these statements and not been made in medicine got even a sanction these products and not and came to diagnose\nAnd treat your or prevent any disease\nA country like vitamins we've been helping people live happy\nHealthy lives since Nineteen Seventy one and we believe integrity should always be our number one ingredient we're committed to this belief because you deserve high quality nutrition specifically\nCrafted with the highest standards to support your health a country like manufacturing facility is an NFL GM be registered facility as well as USDA certified organic so you can feel good about the products you're taking a country like vitamins is also the verse supplement company in the United states do have a ... line of products certified gluten\nFree that's over five hundred brought a country like vitamins ledge of integrity is based on my standards authenticity ...
