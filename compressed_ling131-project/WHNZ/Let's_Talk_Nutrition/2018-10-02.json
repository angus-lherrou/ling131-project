natural health and nutrition North American urban may be only oregano oil you can take on a daily basis lead you Trish in on the Web that laptop nutrition dot com we're back from the brain that led to rejoin Dr Michael dark out\nAre listening to a doctor anger him talk about these microorganisms viruses bacteria\nYou know parasites fungi me just share one a couple of things about viruses and then cut doctor Ingram loose here to tell you about\nA how to deal with some of these microorganisms as he's been alluding to ah with the exception of newly discovered ... and I'll tell you in the later with a pre on is a viruses\nAre the smallest agents of infectious disease they are the smallest most of them um well they consist of little more than a small piece of genetic material\nThat surrounded by a very thin protein coating that's all they are and some are surrounded by then fatty on below okay but\nViruses are different from all the other infectious microorganisms because why\nThey're the only category of micro organism than that cannot cannot replicate cannot survive outside of a host and uh some of these viruses or don't eat food because viruses\nTony food what they do is they will capture or the materials in energy from the host cells and they hijack the cellular machinery from the host\nAnd um some don't even consider them a some scientists\nReally they think of them as complex molecules rather than an organism\nThat's interesting some of these viruses have no ...\nNo respect for other microorganisms either and uh they're called bacteria ... and they will even insect bacteria so these viruses are insidious they've been around millions of years and they're difficult to deal with\nDoctoring and welcome back out so you were you were talking about some of these compounds are that we find in plants oil of oregano you were talking about for example that\nHave you and your view the ability to deal with these viruses yes\nYeah I was mentioning that they were wondering where they harvested the internal organs of the of the animals okay so that was done and then they took the virus Laden material and made the vaccine\nIn the ... yeah\nAnd so we're all infested\nWith this ah Italian investigators found that half of Americans have half of American men have it in their sperm and you know about half of the pregnant women have it in the bloodstream so and that's current so a lot of people are asking well how do I clean up my system\nAnd and maybe we can look at for example of work done by Turkish investigators as well as some work done by the by the Greek the Greek first of all at the University of festival Nikki found that oil of wild oregano put inside a solution kills\nA wide range of cats are so so if you put a small amount like a one in four thousand or one in two thousand delusion in a flurry of cancer cells that killed from\nLong Island university and then we'll get to with the Turks I learned from the Turks Long Island university did a study on prostate cancer\nAnd I'm going to get to the viral connection and the fungal connection where they were able to kill Ninety nine point nine percent of the prostate cancer cells with the with car recall which is a big active ingredient of oregano oil [noise]\nUh when I was in Turkey\nThe village chief said why are you doing this and that you Americans are here's what we use for cancer and he picks up the case of pop bottles which she had kept with juice or aromatic hide resolve oregano\nHonest to God and he was you know I said you don't want to get me in prison you I'm going to tell the world that they can just take juice oregano for cancer is it well that's what we use up here in the mountains\nWhat did he have in the pop bottles aromatic Congress all yeah remember I sent you some yes\n... okay it is the hydro czar or aromatic water of the wild oregano that comes out of a out of the steam distillation when the water is\nCan danced in the can denser it's very it's very accurate kind of aromatic strong stuff you've taken it before\nIt yes I have yeah and and so when someone\nAnd see I Can't prescribe on the radio and we know that but when someone approaches me it's just I got this I've got that I've got trouble I don't know what to do I always tell them to get the juice of oregano at least that's what's being used an ethno botanical historical use\nAh and and have and so it's got a history of use for these kinds of conditions\nAnd and why not take the oil\nSo you've got two components the aromatic hide with us all and the wild oil of oregano\nNow Dr is going to tell you how they get their hands on that how do they get a hold of a doctor Ingram\nThat you have your your your your water I Know\nIn ... in Turkey and Syria and in in Greece these are the some big domains but in this case Turkish and you\nYou dry it and that's where they get it from it it goes from five thousand twelve thousand feet above sea level [noise]\nYouth then put it in the hopper and you make the the oil and you harvest the the waters and the waters and come over to the states by container and then this bottled\nA and a kudos to them because it's kind of an act good strong material and probably nobody would have the foresight to put it on the market to Americans because it doesn't taste like ice cream\nAnd but they also make a high ... of of orange blossom that comes from the mountains of Lebanon and the ... in close to the shore also because that's the bitter orange tree [noise]\nUm [noise] they make one for Rosemary and that's the again comes from mountains about five thousand feet above sea level now the Rosemary and the rug into those grow on Cal curious rock\nSo they in other words the the raw material is is rock bound and so they harvest step by sniffing the tops and then that's still\nNo but the plant's growing on the rocks it's not just that there is something that relationship between the plant growing where the rocks are why is that beneficial to the plant\nBecause the plant is so high in energy compounds and it's a high energy a growth so it can't survive in dirt\nIt has to feed off of the rock I'll be it needs the calcium and phosphorous to make a T ... because it's a high energy compound production you see so it has to feast on that Cal curious rock from the old ocean\nThe rock is the food\nThe rock is the food it actually breaks down the rock and turns it into a small amount of soil overtime so you'll see a little teeny bit of soil on the base of the Rosemary or the ...\nAnd so what I reason was if you want to get a human being healthy let's take these high energy compounds that are found in the rose Mary that are found in the oregano\nAnd and let's look in chef that\nDo you have that North American urban spice any of that Jews from the Rosemary anymore\nDo they do oh what's that called a essence of wild Rosemary I think so I find that care on it to do a one two punch\nShould take 'em at separate times you pick the juice of oregano maybe in the morning you take your Rosemary at noon and other shot a juice oregano at night now Rosemary is highly anti\nAlso don't forget Penn State university did the study on breast cancer Milner and his group M. I. O. N. E. R. I Believe showing that Rosemary oil was more effective than anything I don't know if it was topic weren't journal in the animal model as anti tumor for breast\nAnd that's Rosemarie in a gas it a very powerful and I couldn't\nSo and Rosemary fat soluble so I mean that's just a couple of options for people because you see these waters are edible food they are used in cosmetics but they're also used in food\nWell I was reading a that in fact they use us or the tigers solves and agriculture to\nOh I didn't know the yeah\nLet me let me see here in addition Hodges also I'm quoting also find application of biological agricultural against mushrooms mildew insects emperor fertilization of soils\nFertilization of soils I Do know I remember in a a guy who was able to use the rug know to to to kill some of the pathogens in the soil and the the the plants grew twice as fast a book\nAnd these compounds are really they're really miraculous but they were all designed to protect the oregano plant right\nWell that's right you've got five thousand ten thousand feet above sea level and you've got mountain and you have to survive the snow capped so those phenomena compounds are in the plant for its own survival and those clients don't get disease\nIt's almost impossible to find any kind of mold or Russia I'm older disease or insect borne illness on the ... or the wild Rosemary the wild sage [noise]\nUm but my my thinking was if it can grow on rock to adjust the rock and and uh you know incorporate\nSomething that's impossible\nOr what to do when you eat it when I'm kind of power and energy would that\nWould let me just ask if you know do you know are there any animals that\nHave figure it out to consume the oil that the the goats eat the the oregano\nGoats that in those areas don't get disease [laughter]\nI'll be darned so you'll find that you don't you don't have to go to turkey were doctoring or North American spice gets that raw material that's where they get it you can go you can go to North America nervous spice dot com read a bottom look and learn sold and find health stores throughout North America the oil over again to the Jews of oregano\nYou got the the juice of for Rosemary and whatever it's all there the essence a\nGreater effort in life man yeah essence of wild Rosemary that's what it's called Dr ... thank you for the education we appreciate it we are
