apparently ... they're flapping noise and fruits and vegetables in at an apples and strawberries for example there is this a\nCompound called fist and it's a flower annoyed\nAnd they did an experiment with mice and they found out that the fist and a was a bowl when they treated the mice with this with this ... or ... this thing they saw reduction level reduced levels of ... cells in other words\n... cells dying because of aging\nOr and pro long lifespan in the mice which contributed to the overall health now this is an experimental stage of course I understand but nevertheless the doctor Robbins suggested that these results suggest that we can extend the period of health\nTerm help span even towards the end of life these\nThese this compound was administered to these mice that were\nYou know little older so even later in life they had a good effect I'm so it's just one little piece but this whole business of cellular ... it is a hallmark of aging um it is what causes us\nTo look older it's part of what causes us to look older the breakdown everything begins and ends on a cellular level right\nLife begins and ends aging begins and ends on the cellular level in one little sell so much goes on um\nIt it's it's among the aging process ... it's just one of the process these and its underlies chronic diseases it contributes to loss of resilience\nI'm ... and these um these\nMolecules called sin Olympics\nWill induce ... sell out at a pop toasters in other words\nThey will get rid of these dying cells they delay or or levy ate all kinds of disorders in in pre clinical studies so these these compounds arm miraculous in what they can do\nAnd it's all about the food right food is chemistry\n[laughter] it is it is\nAnd you need we need to understand these chemical compounds and how they behave and how they behave in us in what contribution they can make\nSo these these ... these similar the molecules have are very effective and safe they've been proven to be so in clinical trials and they can be transferred ... transformative\nAnd how we age and it's just one little thing eating an apple right eating some strawberries that's why I keep saying a plant based diet you will not find these compounds\nIn meat you won't get protein and meat but you won't find these these kinds of compounds and meet they only come from plants\nAnd so when you eliminate plants from your diet and you're eating a highly processed food diet you're you're guaranteed to be written with information sooner or later why\nBecause you don't have the chemical the chemical makeup to to deal with the inflammation and you can't just rely you're not feeding your body for it to even mount a defense\n\nThese things happen all tracks back the food and lifestyle how we live enough sleep and rest exercise managing stress basic fundamental things\nNow I'm speaking of lifestyle fundamental things\nYou recall several weeks ago I re supported on a study where they were talking about not even one drink of alcohol was safe\nWell there was another study just came out the trending now it's casting doubt ah on the\nSo called health benefits of even light alcohol consumption\nThere is a theory out there or a hypothesis not so much a theory maybe\nAnd an honor the allergy clinic at St Mary's hospital in London was named after him [noise] so he's famous in his own right here\nAre so at that point he had more than a half a century of his of his career to go\nAnd he said quote so often people say how is it it you've live so long and he says and I I said that's just luck nothing else he doesn't have any great a secret formula magic potion\nHe's a hundred and six and and and then he'll gently remind you in one half\nA he's still consults with patients from time to time and he writes articles contributes to journals or he reaches medical journals he says and keeps up in the field that he helped pioneer the field of allergies out allergic Madison whatever you want to call it\nHe said that uh uh Paul Watkins wrote a biography about Dr Franklin and um\nIt was titled from hell island to hay fever pretty clever title how long island was whereas where Dr Franklin was held prisoner and hay fever of course dealing with allergies\nAnd or Mr walked in and said this this has been quite a unique experience\nAnd one that I think very few people have the privilege to do even more so with Dr Franken of this remarkable long life which he is seen so many changes so many challenges and has been through so many really quite remarkable experiences\nWhich most of us can't even comprehend\nWhat distinguishes Dr Franklin is not only does he is he living a long time but they say he is he is his mental acuity he's so sharp of mind\nI'm currently writing a paper about how penicillin was discovered based on his work time and work with Dr Fleming who discovered penicillin\nHe does a they reported acknowledge the sadness is sad moments of life as well as the good moments the happy end high highlight moments\nThat he has experienced uh he um said that quote I'm so interested in not only the president and the future but particularly I suppose the past and it's nice looking back some of the enjoyable trips that I did\nIs a hundred and six man and he's working he's writing articles sees patients from time to time and he does eat there's nothing I can find where he has you know he set about to want to live a long time\nUm\nHe he just I'm looking at some photographs of him when he was a younger this one photograph it looks like he's in the sixties I think about that sixty he had yeah he's going to be alive yet another forty six years\nUm he said keep your mind strong he said when you get all there are some of the things you can't do\nI'm too old he said to go on runs and keep fit in that sort of way but I certainly keep my brain going all the time and I read a lot of scientific journals and things which come to me monthly and some even the British medical journal once a week close quote\nIn twenty Fifteen at the age of a hundred and three Dr Franklin received the order of the British Empire for his significant contributions to the field of allergy\nAllergic research so um he said I think what helps me is that if you leave a sensible life and don't smoke\nAnd don't over eat and do a bit of exercise be energetic and whatever it is it is socially and psychologically and emotionally you're doing and take things all in your stride that's his advice\nBe sensible right don't smoke don't overeat do a bit of exercise be enthusiastic and energetic and whatever you do\nAnd take things in stride I sounds like good advice doesn't it sound like good advice to me very simple very simple you know a little bit or earlier I was talking about\n... ah\nYeah these different compounds to\nCounteract ... and what not [noise]\nAnd he just went about his life did his work [noise] enjoyed it help people [noise]\nLived a good life looks like a good man yeah [noise]\nSo you'd like to hear that for a change some some nice story it's a hundred and six [noise]\nI don't know if I'll make that out [noise]

and I pointed out that alcohol is here to stay I wouldn't even begin to try and tell people not to drink I wouldn't tell them do that anyway\n\nAnd it's part of the culture it's part of ours and many others and it's it has it's it is what it is so people make that ... it's a choice\nNow some people may choose not to believe that the science about you know things we talk about the same or it's just the study is not really it doesn't count\nWell I I happen to believe in the data are we challenge the data from time to time we challenge studies but that's not the first study I've reported on most recently won a couple of weeks ago they said there's zero\nNo alcohol at all none they didn't they weren't even talking about one during none I ...

Celsius live their lives on nutrition on the Web and left on nutrition don't come back from the brink cylinder redoing Dr Michael ... the\nScience of nutrition voyage advancing all the time\nAnd the science of of a dietary supplementation and natural products are right along with my guest is Dr Audrey Ross and we're talking about a ... is a a part of the country like vitamins they our subdivision\nOr and science by nature as their little um motto and they developed now a\nVery unique a formula I'm a protein product a hundred percent plant based protein product\nAnd it's interesting ah they call it the base formula um there's one um I ask\nHer why they're they're using that expression that I Know what I Know what based means in chemistry I don't know what they have in mind but this is a very unique product oh so unique plant protein line\nAnd there are a as I count them what three different\nIs it three doctor roster for for\nThe war yeah I see okay well we'll get to that nerve for different offerings here\nAnd they you heard Dr Raasch say that they use my ... permitted plant protein organic pumpkin see protein and water lentils there's a new twist and they combine those sources those raw materials to make the product\nAnd results and they set up a plant protein with complete amino acids profile or nearly the same as white so this is all good doctor Ross welcome back I didn't mean to cut you off there but go ahead\nThat okay so when we talk about the base formula the base for me it would be that just the plant protein with no botanical added to it so it's not okay we'll action is just a simple just plant protein with those three protein sources blended in\nA mild vanilla flavor nothing real I mean it's just a good protein source that's what it is that's what's different\nNow you have in addition to the basic and they're all vanilla right yeah ... ... that's a good thing because then you can add whatever you want to end slavery the way you wish um\nYou have the other three rendition on the pack it on the container canister it says plant protein ... plus right\nAnd and then there's lean being pasta lean pi plus mood and the plus flex\nThis is art now what's the thinking behind the three in addition to the regular bass formulas as just as pee on the front of the canister these are the plus lean mood and flex what do we what are we doing here now\nWell there were adding and the channels because you know people want everything in one drink if they're going to mix up a drink they want to say they want to lose weight workout get some energy that's where we came up with a peep less lean in the ... plus lean we use ... which is a clinically researched botanical which is from cayenne pepper\n... is that trademarked uh-huh\n... trademarked okay go ahead\nYeah and so it was coffee Barry which is coffee fruit extract so the ... increases that burn increases that\nUm internal heat to help metabolize fat\nAnd the coffee Barry provides a hundred milligrams of naturally occurring caffeine not from roasted beans but from actually the coffee fruit\nAnd that helps promote breaking down fat as well as burning calories so the lean is the only one that we cannot say ... going on because with the cap some acts we added a cream flavor to it because some people get stomach burning with\nUm cayenne pepper right all the small um ingredient of the Korean flavor which comes from a milk product right we can't labor label it began but there's so little in there even if you're lactose intolerant it's not going to affect you but that's why that's vegetarian so that's our speaking\nSo the does does it really ... to what extent do you think it would help with weight loss or of port being part of a person's weight loss program\nWhat's going to help with a thermal genesis the heating up and the burning of calories and the breakdown of fat both the caps and max and the coffee bury the registered trademark ingredients have got substantial studies on that you know you talked about having some\nSteady that information and some real base clinically studied results and so we're using in these and we have DNA verified botanical in them and that's important too because when you extract the chemicals you can lose the actual benefit of\nThe south so somebody wanted to lose weight or they want to go on a weight loss program and they're looking for a protein product this would be this unto itself may not get them to lose all the way they want right\nCorrect but it would be as supportive component of their program\nAnd protein creates a sense of society are full feeling full so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Let's Talk Nutrition", "city": "Tampa", "day": "05"}
