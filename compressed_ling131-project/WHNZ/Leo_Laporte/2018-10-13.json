{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "I'll come back and now here's some more conventional wisdom that you breathe the man on a mission to retire American one first genetic guy bombs\nLoves it back to last segments do on the radio show today we've been talking about why people fail to become financially free fail to become financially successful live lives a quiet desperation um you know mediocre lives\nAnd one of the reasons you know we we talked about two reasons in this last segment so one of them was the lack mentality or the other one was the belief that the job is the only way to earn money those are two strong beliefs in our society\nUm but there's one other one and this is the ability to treat all your life away [noise]\nUm I don't have a name for it I got to come up with a name for it structurally so that I can use it more more commonly but it's the ability to get up every day and go do life and ended up with nothing to just piddle life away one beer at a time sort of as his next article will cover\nUm but it's just like you know why is it that you wake up today and you know better off than you were a year ago you ever come at the end of the year two thousand sixteen\nWhat's different your life or you've heard people on tell del say well I bought it six houses issue next Germany by two apartment complex\nAnd you see people change their lives radically year after year after year when their members watch them but there is something different about what they're doing and everybody else because everybody else is out there working and everybody else is out there believing that they are investing because they believe that savings and saving is investing\nBut putting money in a four one K. are putting money and I are re or putting in his savings account\nIs not investing in your future is not building income stream it is not building businesses it's not helping society at all it's not helping you at All right and when you get done just like shove your money in your pocket the end of the day the only amount of money of let your box what you don't spend\nBut not spending money does it make you more money you have to invest so I'm going to share this rather comical little spiel with you\nOr somebody said to me because I think it actually identified that situation [noise] this is a conversation between a husband and her wife\nAnd a husband and wife and the wife asked us if you drink beer and the husband said yes women says how many beers a day man says usually about three women says how much do you pay per beer man says about five bucks which includes a tip\nWoman says and how long have you been drinking man says about Twenty years I suppose woman says so a beer cost five bucks and you have three a day which put your spending each month at four hundred and fifty dollars in one year would be approximately five thousand four hundred dollars correct and the ... men does some math and says okay correct\nAnd the woman says if a one year you spend fifty four hundred dollars not accounting for inflation the past Twenty years would put your spending it one hundred eighty thousand dollars correct answers after some calculations correct\nThe woman who says do you know that if you didn't drink so much beer that money could have been put in a stepped up interest savings account and after accounting for compound interest for the Twenty years you would have a ... you could have had a new\nAirplane and the man looks at the woman and says do you drink beer and a woman goes nope it looks or their face and says where's your airplane [laughter]\nYou're gonna have to think about that when that when you got to go in so easy because it's not about her husband or wife arguing it's about the logic that living without actually makes your life better\nBut it doesn't\nAnd if you really look at it shows you can have an airplane that's even dumber because your play would cause even more money so the entire conversation which was put together I Believe originally be considered a husband wife type joke about a men's the money and how women see money\nIt really defined society you believe out there in your world that if you say five bucks\nIf you save a hundred bucks a thousand bucks a month it's going to add up to something and then you're going to be able to buy crap with it what is crap anything in life you don't need but what you really need is not the ability to buy a piece of crap all a plane car jet ski boat\nYou need to have a regular reoccurring stream of income that you can retire on\nThat you can grow into the future so you can afford to buy is Mitch is many toys or as much ... use my vernacular is many toys as you want to buy and still not have to get up and go to work but nowhere did the lady she if you had all that money you could take a month off\nOr you might be able to have an investment in an apartment where did you could retire for the rest of your life you see the jokes can't even get that close to the reality of what it takes to become successful here's a wife ditching or husband out\nAbout being wasteful and not having financial success because he drink beer and those nails hey America all you guys out there talking about how great it is to save money and your four one K. and your IRA and your savings ... and ... billion college fund\nAll that money out there and all those accounts is it making you financially free\nIs making you happy\nAre you being able to retire and the answer to all the above questions is no no no no you my friends have nothing just like the lady who doesn't drink beer\nWhere's your plane my friends or in other words where's your investments that will retire you wear has your wealth gone that you should have had because of all the working and sacrificing you've done in your entire life\nMy proposition is it was never there in the first place\nBecause working for a living is not the secret to becoming financially free it's not the secret to becoming wealthy and it's not going to be the secrets is going to allow you to retire in any year in the near future my friends I beg you\nPlease change the way you see the world because as how you see the world is you a real problem as Einstein said and if you keep doing the same crazy stuff you're doing you're going to keep getting the same results and if you think you're not\nThen you're saying [noise] have a wonderful day she'd 'em off [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nAh\n\nThank you for your radio show every\nTime you get obtained there was

[noise]\nAll right thank you Kevin big test today for the number two bulldogs is they take on LSU threatened\nWords in Georgia has John what's been expected six no winning by an average nearly thirty points a game yet there's still some hedging out there some questions about Georgia and they're often why yeah I can watch in the last\nFew weeks so they you know like you said in in the end they won comfortably against Missouri and Tennessee and Vanderbilt but they kind of started slow and at times and the games the office just hasn't seemed to be clicking away that we might expect it and what I noticed this week digging into some numbers their biggest issue\nHas been throwing the ball and what we call obvious past ... thirty five yards are more and they've only had twenty five plays the season that category it's not a big sample\nBut Jake from has been sacked on five of those twenty five placed fumbled on three of those five sex in addition to that through two interceptions it he's just being hit a lost because defenses or blood in him and getting to sometimes not until right after he throws\nBut you don't want him to get hit and they're just having a hard time protecting him some of that is some youth and inexperience in the office of wind but that's an issue that still going to be there today Gus LSU Trevor what\nKind of problems with ... defense a\nFace against this Georgia often ...

Brad ... those guys are available up right now on ESPN and Kevin winter with you in Studio Georgia LSU with more on this match up we go from here on the campus of the worldwide leaders to a place where it's going to get crazy today that Baton Rouge daddy's tiger stadium is very body as being out of college football reporter\nRyan ... college for it out to be all those coming up brain death valley we're known for the rock is atmosphere that they've got going on ... you know it doesn't matter if\nYou had a chance to talk with George Head coach Kirby Smart he's currently the biggest concern or is it something else\nThink that it initially you know I I think they just haven't been tested yet and part of not being tested is\nWell is Georgia loses it to me could significantly decreased the SEC chances of getting two teams into the final top for really and the reason I say that is because the best case scenario for Alabama and Georgia to both the undefeated heading in the SEC can't write write\nLoser that game has a great shot at getting and\nKeep it close and ... may maybe get to keep it within a certain number of\nRight right but that is one of those two teams drops a game before getting into the SEC championship game\nThe runner up is at least going to be a two last team right I think at that point it becomes much more difficult for the selection committee to justify aid to last team that did not win it's conference championship game\nAnd that's going forward with because the the the ... the storyline today ... we don't know who Georgia is right they haven't played any but he bought here comes the Gulf right with the whole issue with Florida with Kentucky with ... so they could they slip in one of those and yet still win and get in\nThey can yes because any team\nThat has a shot to win the SEC obviously has a chance to finish in the top for sure right so if they stumble they can get in they can get in and they won last SEC can't I just think it's really difficult to get in as a to last team that didn't\nWhen you are a league and and I think that the likelihood of that certainly increases\nBased on what we've seen from Alabama but like you said yours or hasn't played any but yeah I don't know what to expect from them in this game but I don't know what to expect from allergies run deep it sure because that's the key to the whole game and they got ... got hammered last week yeah exactly so I think to me it it's all on their rushing defense and can they slow those guys down\nHazard energy has to be out of college football reporter inside of at the college football playoff selection committee she joined just sheer out of college football life so that's our game agency and even though we're two weeks away from the first release of the ... of the rankings\nIt seems like we have been a limited conferences early on in the big twelve with Texas speeding Oklahoma last week with West Virginia being undefeated they got an interesting tested names I guess I Would say that I Want to have tax is going to maybe get back into the conversation\nHere are they they're in the conversation to a\nPoint you can't forget the fact that they lost Maryland and the season opener Maryland everybody right right now I'm an ex field for that game and I can promise you it's a completely different taxes team than the one I saw for and the thirty members of the selection committee will realize\nThat Marilyn was going through extenuating circumstances first time back on the field at the after the death of their teammate Nineteen year old ... during the ... a lot of emotions in that\nGame by Maryland is still Maryland at the end of the day and they're they're a mediocre football team they're an average opponent at that right that law isn't going to go away at the same time everything\nThat the big twelve does has to be measured against Notre Dame as long as they're undefeated because here's the thing if you got one last Texas or one last Oklahoma\nYou're not going to get in at the expense of an undefeated Notre Dame\nLet's look at the Notre Dame angle because when they won on the road last week at Virginia Tech I remember catching you off the year and we yeah we should it's over it it the ... there as long as Notre Dame does\nRight they're going to go on to the how much of a crank does is holding the selection committee for the first time because nobody measure benefactor\nYet it hasn't it hasn't and if they can continue to be relevant\nI mean you'll be looking at the possibility going back to what we're talking about earlier USCC teams and Notre Dame in there sure why no ... Alabama Georgia Notre Dame and and maybe Clinton so and or maybe if they do stumble at some point down the strict you've gotta considering undefeated Notre Dame team ahead\nOf the a one last pack well ... yeah\nSpeaking of the pact well Washington Oregon the ... you know it's an elimination game ... ... just a conference elimination game let's say where we can reach Washington\nI think so because I don't I'm not convinced that Colorado has staying power\nShort and I got a tough one and they're huge underdog to at USC\nThey are they are I Would take us either win that game but when you look at it right now it's Washington Oregon and Washington has got to win that game because if they don't give me then I think the pack wealth is absolutely not even on the bubble anymore they're out of it is yes\nAnd they're great appreciate it they had me on my editor Janet she'll be all around the campus later on this afternoon yeah but what you what you got to do it brought down with football I Want to give you a couple of quick update number one Florida leading at Vanderbilt my ... uh the gators you got to survive after drilling early in this game of ... that whole that ended the\nTennessee get joins Thirteen to twenty four Ohio State a dirty water have for the games on the leading act Notre Dame will keep me up there on all the good ones\nBut body of the radio presenter my doctor pepper at your local doctor pepper short today grab some delicious I called Dr Pepper your virtual drink fans ... college football games are played\nGeorgia LSU number two number Thirteen rub jak belly\nWhat's it called ... they're not really sure the ... the David ... your numbers that get\n[noise] thank you very much going on around the\nWill be on hand for the match up this afternoon I have to begin with a\nThey say in football the games are decided in the trenches and to be honest with you yes if you could draw the line of scrimmage on both sides [noise] probably wouldn't\nIssue I mean that's what the program strikes have\nTen Fifteen Years are really got last mile fire shoe which\nBoy they didn't have a guy that could create a power trip throws down the field and they give off in the balance they needed to run the ball\nThe ball against elite detractors but [noise] now they\nThat type of guy and job or are they could just go to\nBecause we've seen Ireland to thousands with guys like\nThat you know to Marcus Russell and ...\nDavy and Josh ...
