[laughter] yeah\nYeah 'cause I Know that that's looking at the one the other day of class as I can do if there's a big difference for between a syndicator in a in a narrow and I'm I'm trying to bite is not a real I don't know I may have to syndicate one just to do one\nBut I I'm trying to do it as an Ira ... that way but the differences is that there becomes the depth of cash you can actually come up with\nAnd so you look at these things and say okay let's say it's a hundred and fifty thousand a door that is a decent number\nAnd you know you got two hundred units that's thirty million dollars right\nBut if you got three hundred units that's forty five million dollars and that's a big difference when you got to put twenty five percent ... percent closing costs you're talking thirty percent of thirty million compared to thirty percent of forty five million that's half the difference in what you have to come up with\nAnd so I found that you know I'm not afraid to buy the expensive stuff\nBut I don't think I could buy the three and four hundred unit once that makes sense\n[noise] Oh absolutely you're talking about a different ... five million dollars and those two scenarios that you played out there that's a lot a\nLot of cash come up with and it's a situation where I think you're dealing with slightly lower returns that were used to you know on a on a year to year basis however I think there's big capital gain that's out there at the end of the rainbow for those deals\nWell the you know it makes sense given given both of those or neither of those are the way I look at it as is\nTen years from now classes will be class a minus or a class B plus and they will be the center of the market\nNo doubt there will be building properties are going to be you know selling like you say two hundred two hundred and fifty thousand or people will be paying three thousand bucks a month to read it's going to happen that there's no doubt about it it's going to happen and so if you think about it\nWhen I first got ... got I was buying sixties and seventies construction I bought seventies really cool no see I got started eighty seven eighty eight eighty nine that area so I was buying stuff in Seventy ... ten years old this is not bad\nUh by the time I'd been in ten years I was buying stuff in the seventies and started buying stuff in the eighties\nAnd I thought eighties struck construction was like wow clasby stuff this was incredible does unbelievable but man we're we're not talking about two thousand Seventeen I mean that stuff is now like dead it's fifty sixty years old somewhere those buildings have to wear out and give up and go away so\nIt's going to appreciate you coming on the show today thank you for coming on thank you for being a mentor even though he turned us down twice\nSpent a lot of fun [laughter] All right thanks a lot for the rest of you out there remembered this Scott myself in all other lifestyles\nMembers are not doing this just for much we're going to have a wonderful day [noise]\nHe [noise]\n[noise]\n\nYour radio show him\nGet obtained there was a good enough to go on the dot com boom was really really special bond and join the conversation [noise]\nExciting do you do you have any sense of where that is a big one okay\nLet's see where exactly where that is 'cause I Know we're\n[noise] uh [noise] you know in different Alabama who are in\nGeorgia where and I mean\nLord of course I'm a this is W O it's K.

and don't think this is free money and you can go run the thing up and whatever you know no uh it's it's it's got to be treated with respect\nYou know the you've got to use it wisely but you got to have one I mean I I think it's much smarter to carry a credit card and pay it off every month than it is to use a debit card or a check card where you're giving the world direct access to your bank account which can destroy other parts of your finances\nSo use the saving thousands rule number six and spread your newfound knowledge about the dangers of those debit cards\nAnd ask your bank for an old fashioned ATM card for withdrawing cash when you need it and of course\nThat card requires a PIN number at the terminal so it's much more secure hey there's Robert should use real number four don't abuse credit but don't fear it either get yourself a credit card or two for reward purchases but make sure that you make the payments\nOn time and again the saving thousands rules to success can be found at saving thousands dot com okay Robert we've got a question for you how long does negative information like late payments and all that how long will be left on the credit report\nAnd so what will happen is if if it just happened\nRight so if if you got a collection yesterday they've got the records right they're they're heightened ready and you know but if you catch them three four or five years from now and maybe they've they've upgraded their computer software\nAnd not all the data carried over maybe they transferred that from one company to a different company and some records got lost in the mix\nA things happen that companies are not perfect and so when they lose the data lose part of the data right so maybe they can see you had an account but the software no longer tells them what the balances\nOr won the payment is because you got to take one one this this works particularly well with like charge us or old closed accounts right because as long as you owe them money they will keep good records so if you if you owe me money\nThen you're going to stay kind of at the top of the list now once you have paid me off as a as a creditor your importance diminishes and when I'm looking at how many gigabytes and terabytes of data I have and it's time to archive and flushed and upgrade and whatever they do\nOr the people who don't owe me money anymore I don't really care\nRight and so the idea is if you pay to collect it off a couple of years ago\nAnd you disputed today they may just not have the data anymore right because they got paid they're done it's over now they're going to keep it for a little while you can't pay it off and disputed a week later and think it's going to vote off I mean it would take a pretty enough company to lose the data that quickly\nBut as time goes on and so this is where some of these companies have had success they will dispute everything on your credit which I'm not advocating I don't don't just to do everything on your credit you some rhyme or reason to it like look at when it was what it is whatever but these companies will just dispute everything on your credit which you can do all by yourself\nAnd then they will get lucky because that's all you're doing is you're getting lucky and some of the companies will lose the data\nFail to respond on time and again if you ... so if you owe me money\nAnd and I see your disputing it on the credit I'm thinking oh well maybe they're trying to buy a house maybe they're trying to buy a car let me get the collection bulldog back after him and see if I can get my money if they've already paid me I don't care so what motivates every really what motivation does this credit collection\nCompany have to respond to the credit bureaus now if they never respond they'll get in trouble the fast changing Experian expect them to maintain a certain level of integrity what they're reporting and not just let it not just lose every battle on purpose but if you catch 'em right and you don't owe them any money\nThere's a good chance I delete and if you owe them money they will they will produce the records they will go to great lengths because they want their money and they know the best chance they have of getting their money is staying on your credit report\nRight once they're paid their motivation is gone you now as a consumer have a better chance of this company failing to respond failing to have kept the records and this is where that is the process can work so in today's world there are two ways you can dispute you can use the old fashion male method\nAnd support the United States Postal service everybody does they need all the help they can get you know I I support him I spent a ton of direct mail\nBut but the I mean the Internet's killing 'em anyway so or you can speed it online so like at my psycho dot com when I pulled that sixty dollar credit report yesterday to go over with everybody on line at the bottom of each bureau was started as a button said start dispute\nA and in some cases you can so I guess a throwback to the other thing you can get a free credit Puerto Rico and not the guy singing the song where you have ... up for twelve months of advantage whatever blah blah blah but you can get a real free credit report if you have in most states if you've been denied for credit so the idea is if I call\nAnd try to get a mortgage or I Try to get a credit card or whatever I get denied I should then get to know why it was denied and what's on my credit report\nAnd so if if the if the U.S government said everybody gets free credit reports all the time people would it be used it\nSo what they said is if you are denied for credit\nThen you can go get a free credit for it to find out what's in your file so if you've recently been denied for credit\nYou can go on to each other three bureaus and apply to get your free credit report and then you could use that to start the dispute process completely free online now that you have to do at Equifax trans union and experience I always found it was easier just to pay the the sixty bucks or the thirty bucks or whatever it is\nUm but anyway but you can do the free rat as well and so now it was we talk about disputes\nRight we're talking about the type and so I'm actually going to try this Rob oh I'm going to run an experiment a boy and so I uh I I have a thirty day late on my credit report\nFrom discover All right this happened or\nSomething like five or six years ago and it was because I didn't have the money it was like I was I got an a three dollar [noise] so what happened is I paid\nI paid the card in full but I missed it by a couple of whatever happened there and so there was like a couple of bucks in interest that went on there and then I didn't use the car and so I didn't think to go back on and check on their payments and so I Do like a three dollar minimum payment on a three dollar balance and I missed it because I don't I don't check my mail very regularly um\nThis was in the early days of starting the mortgage out early and I was distracted so I have this very day late on my credit this was like five years ago five six years ago so what I did is and this is what I recommend anyone do if you do accidentally get a thirty day late immediately pay the cardio full and close it cancel it\nBe done with it right because we want to get out of their system as quickly as possible\nOn top of our credit standing is something most of us just don't do let's admit it you know usually happens is we fall in love with the car we falling over the boat or bigger yet we fall in love with a house and we really want it but we kept tonight\nNow that comes as a total surprise if where you're taking time on a regular basis to check on her credit reports we could have been pro active and improve the situation so no bad surprises now that\nMakes for a confident consumer this all ties in directly with the savings\nYou know if you've done the same job for a couple of years and none of these got just pop up\nAnd you can give me your documentation one time and never come back you find a document mhm so what we're talking about here today it's kind of worst case scenario because my hope is everyone listening picks up on one little thing and said oh I just got hit with child support and make sure I tell my lender about that\nOh my down payments coming from my aunt she keeps your money in a safe that may be a problem let me talk about that now you know by knowing what these worst case scenarios are because all mortgages or not this tough to document right only the ones that have the gotcha something goes wrong I'd say maybe five percent of our mortgages have this kind of excessive documentation Ninety five percent of people\nIs that race clean the two banks payments are perfect their names right there at the bank names right there the account numbers right there the average balance if they're the money's been in their savings account for both months it's no problem there W. two at a job there forty hours a week their tax returns or ten forty easy they've been inside with the IRS everything is perfect\nYou will have an easy time of documentation stage ... if you haven't file tax returns you follow kind of crazy business returns you know you have a ... income that varies all over the place you have weird large deposits where you move money from account account to account\nAll this is going to cause problems during the documentation states has something to think about it you do look to buying a house\nAs Robert said for most people the process is nearly seamless but in some cases things in your life could complicated and communication has got to be the key with the mortgage company just remember nobody's picking on you\nThey're not trying to make things difficult they are simply documents by law must be reviewed to get that mortgage\nLet's talk about her Ford ability Robert you know what happens so often a couple of fall in love with the house and later they'll have a conversation and they'll say well we know the payments to stretch but we can trim a thing or two we can make the payment\nHusband they verbally volunteer to go back on goal for tickets to the game and the white may say okay I'll cut down on pedicures\nBut you know what so often the sacrifices are never made and Robert people become a prisoner of the house payment\nYeah we we try to have a lot of conversations about budgeting and just because you can qualify for it doesn't mean that so we're going to put on your qualification letter because again that's exactly what happens you know it's it's with the first thing we're going to talk about is what are you comfortable with\nKnow before we talk about what we think you qualify for how much of a house payment do you think you'd be comfortable with\nA well Robert I think we'd be recovered twelve or fourteen hundred will because you may qualify for Eighteen hundred or two thousand but let's start with what you're comfortable with because again we don't know your habits you know how often do you eat out do you pay for daycare yeah so ... when you're being qualified for a mortgage we only look at your debt\nYou know because you can't handle you can't stop that the idea is anything you could turn off you know well if your wife lose their job or if the husband loses his job then you could pull the kid out a daycare and take care of yourself\nYou can get off the cable you know you you can quit eating out and so we don't we don't factor those into qualification because we know if you cut your lifestyle back the basics you can make the payment but\nIs that what you want in life you know you want to be in a situation\nYou know we're all your income is going into your house and you can't afford to do things you like to do so I always like to start the conversation with\nYou know with how much can you afford and a lot of home builders hate this you know they they want their preferred mortgage company to tweak you up as high as you can cause they want to sell you every option and everything they can or you know we really like to understand what our client what's going to make you comfortable\nAnd then again watch out for the gotcha is like higher taxes higher because if you tell me what twelve hundred dollar payment\nAnd all of a sudden the taxes are three hundred a month instead of two hundred a month well guess what your payments going up by a hundred bucks yep and even though you still qualify for it and this can be a trap because so if you only qualify for twelve hundred a month and you fall in love with the houses Thirteen you come back to me we have to say no\nBecause you just don't qualify yeah but if you do qualify for the more money but you were just trying to stay conservative now you have a harder time trying to convince your family and everybody else well well honey the mortgage company will give us the loan for Thirteen hundred a month why aren't you comfortable with it\nWell dear I think we should really stick around twelve hundred well we can get approved for Thirteen hundred though and the house we love is Thirteen hundred and we see a lot of people found this trap and ended up buying more house than they're comfortable with they can afford it but now they have to make lifestyle changes and not everyone's willing to make those lifestyle changes which is how people can get in trouble with owning a home\nBack to basics Robert when we go to secure alone the word wop comes up and many people are totally familiar with the process but if they make the wrong choice it could cost them right the first thing they hear from the loan company is oh you should never walk\nYou this and they convinced you to float and as soon as you agree to float you've not lost all your power or because so still getting their quota this great right up front they convinced you to float right Rob put yourself in a situation right you're a homebuyer you listen to rule number one\nYou shop around you're doing good but then you let the mortgage guy convinced you to float okay so now thirty days go by and it's time to go to closing on your new home and they say okay Rob ... floating any more\nTime to go to closing you have to lock the rate and before you can go to closing a and you know what my sisters brothers best friend was wrong oh rates did not get better\nAnd in fact they're much much worse and I'm not going to give you a nine percent interest rate\nWhat are you gonna do and you're going to ask me to bring more money to ... what are you going to Iraq I mean are you going to do with him are you going to walk away from the dream home are you going to walk away from the home that you're in love with that your wife's in love with that you showed the kids and you put the pictures on Facebook and you've been rolled the kids in school and everything\nOr you're going to take the ridiculous nine percent right now that's obviously a very uh outlandish example no one's going to raise the rate that much they could what would you do I mean what are they raised their eight to four or five six seven eight nine ten twenty if it's the day before closing what are you going to do stop your stock or you have two choices take the higher rates\nOr walk away from the house and the industry knows\nThat most people will take the higher\nRate and if he walked away they attach\n... if I Walk away there's also penalties if after I don't want to lose my astro yeah absolutely you can even get sued by the seller at that point because see the thing is you have financing in place now some real estate contracts are written that your financing has to be below a certain rate routes that doesn't qualify but even that expires with a finance contingency so it's just a bad situation\nThe way to protect yourself from this it's simple make sure you get\nThe ... the rate lock lock the rate it up front do not let them convinced you to play the float game the only person who benefits from you playing the game is the mortgage company okay because remember it cost us money to lock your rate it\nRight so by locking your writing upfront we take more risk in the market\nBecause I I have to lock your eight and then if the inspection comes back bad or the appraisal comes in lower the things I could potentially have losses in the market and we have really complex formula as I wrote for our hedging software that that I wrote that that does all this here at our pie funding and and I think we do it better than most people\nSo we don't take as much risk but some lenders have a really high risk especially when when you're dealing with a mortgage broker because the mortgage broker the limit is ...\nThey're actually gonna get the loan so the mortgage broker asked a locked alone with the lender and then the limit is even if the mortgage broker really has a file they've never met you\nAnd so there's all this cost built in the race around locking so mortgage guys for as they can make more money if they convinced you to float to the end and then on top of that they can bait and switch you because they can quote you are really low rate today oh ... we've got the best right in the country today let me give you a to point two percent interest rate\nAnd you say okay great let me like that and went on overall we shouldn't lock it in\nWhich should lock that it and we want to let that float I don't ever float right that I force every customer lock and that's my personal belief I that that is one thing I Am so\nPassionate about right and it's just such a core part of my beliefs\nThat you do not gamble with this you do not floats your right nothing good can come for the consumer out of floating the rate and that's why we force everyone to lock it even if it costs me business even if it cost me a customer I'm going to force you to do what I Know is best for you which is lucky rate in on your mortgage\nUp front at initial time of application because what happens a lot of time did you say well well if I float and the market gets better I Will get a lower rate in theory yes but what most mortgage companies do is they float you and if the market gets better they don't tell you about it and they just keep the extra money I had this happen every day\nWhen I was in wholesale so before the funding I actually bought loans for mortgage brokers as a part of what we did ... we bought loans from mortgage brokers we bought loans from other correspondent lenders so we would see how they did business and how they took advantage of their clients and what they did and and and this whole floating thing the customer almost never got the benefit of it\nThey would always leave the customer at the same rate and they would pocket the difference if their market got better if the market got worse than they would ... the customer up higher if the market stay the same they would usually jak the costs rep and lie to them and tell them to market got worse so the simple way to avoid all this\nAnd this is a key part of shopping for a mortgage rule number one is shop around and then a sub rule of that is if you're shopping for a mortgage make sure you can get a written rate lock commitment up front it's the only way to protect yourself\nFrom a bait and switch from a bad situation down the road is to have that written rate lock agreement up front\nAnd so if a company has some kind of crazy rule like you can't lock the rate until the third Thursday of every leap year you can't lock the rate until the appraisal comes back or you can't lock the rate until the senior vice president gets back from Hawaii and reviews your file personally but I don't know what kind of crazy stuff they come up with\nBut you want to comedy that can lock your rate in I Would say within twenty four hours of the initial conversation you do not want to let a lot of time get by because see what happens is if if\nRight I mean there are some sales manager jumped out of his window just sharing a that right but you know these types of things that that if businesses buy into then the other how many million people that don't listen to me\nCan benefit as well and so you know real number seven is about spreading it's my way to spread this knowledge by encouraging business owners and business managers to run their business like I Do in a way to put consumers first in a way that reinforces the rules and the principles we teach here on the saving thousands radio network\nA real number nine is a practice what you learn and always learn more\nSo this is this is one of yours Rob Rob Newton contribute to this one\nOr if you don't practice it what's the point I mean if you're not going to do this stuff\nIf you're not going to shop around if you're not going to do your numbers if you're not going to wait three days if you're not going to you know refused to abuse credit and if you're going to be your credit\nAnd if you don't want to know their tricks and if you do know you're still gonna let them pull them on you then why do you do flip over to classic rock or a pop music or something I mean what why waste your time listening to me if you're not going to put this stuff into practice\nSo real number eight is practice what you learn that you've always got to learn more I Am a I'm a constant student I can still learn you know and I think no matter how big my company is no matter how much I\nDo and how much I Know I can always learn more and there's always someone I can learn from and I'm always reading books and I'm always listening to other shows and I'm I'm always trying to educate myself and and I think that's important rule\nSo that's number eight practice what you learn and always learn more and then rule number nine to share your successes I said this is different so sharing the knowledge right\nSharing the knowledge about telling other people\nWhat what's going on and and and sharing the the resources in a way to learn sharing your successes is when you didn't go back and say hey you know what I\nDid some of this stuff and actually save some money this is what sharing your successes rule number nine is all about because when your friends and family other listeners here this stuff doesn't work\nAnd that you did try and if you don't have to be a financial guru you don't have to be the owner of a big company wants to be a mortgage guide to be a financial but I'd have to be a talk show host on the radio to do these things anybody can do um\nAnd so you've got to share your successes because that was going to help us spread this culture to other people because it really makes the whole saving thousands charter powerful is when enough consumers are following it that businesses have to change\nBusinesses have to react and businesses have to stop the abusive practices that they've gotten so good at right because we're done if consumers we're not going to do it anymore we're not going to put up with it we're going to follow the rules and we're going to only want to work with businesses who encourage people to follow the rules and it's going to get to the revolution\nAnd so you've got to share your success with other people have to be aware and have to know that this is working for you because that's going to be their motivation to do better and to be smarter and stop being a financial zombie and the stop me and you're out there floating in a raft with no anger and and becoming a financial ninja and making the decisions\nYou know I've known people whose lives were wrecked because of overspending and missing payments they really had no hope and and they just went from paycheck to paycheck and they were constantly behind then they finally copied those Fifteen saving thousands rules to success and began to put the rules and the motion now before long things began to clear up\nAnd they actually took charge of their money see these guidelines aren't theory they're Proven Ways to find me become empowered and it can happen with you follow the saving thousands rules\nListener Beth right soon I listen to the show every week they're not sure what I've learned with my friends and family can you tell me what is his girl\nEscrow that's a that's a good question you know the little things that ... that I forget about you know you but you do it for so long you\nForget what some of the the thing is it that you know that the normal average person does not know now\nSo the whole idea behind escrow is that we're going to pay the taxes and insurance for you out of the mortgage payment and so what happens is Rob obviously you make your mortgage payment monthly mhm right but taxes property taxes here in Florida are only do once a year and that's in November\nAnd then a insurances do usually once a year and it's on the anniversary of when you got your policy right so we bought your home in March then you're you're ah insurance is do every year in March\nAnd so a lot of people all of a sudden get hit with this bill it it's like all of a sudden they owe six thousand dollars in taxes or two thousand hours and insurance and uh not everyone has budgeted a recording Leon and kept that money out\nAnd so we decided in the mortgage industry it would be helpful if we\nCollected one twelve of the taxes every month and one twelve of the insurance every month so that when the bill 'cause we pay it and say that the homeowner now some people don't like that right some people want to wave escrow they want to handle the account themselves they want to you know try to collect interest on it and then and paid themselves and and that's fine and the problem is we charge you a\nWe charge you a little bit higher rate for that because it increases our risk because the chance of someone defaulting and then also we as a lender don't get to make the interest on that money you know we we have millions and millions of dollars of people just grow money sitting in an account and so there's a a what we call an escrow waiver cost right and so it increases the cost of your loan\nI use is about an eight the interest rate it's not a huge consideration in some cases I you know you can buy it out with a small like a quarter or half point of discount right to get rid of that as a waiver cost\nA but most people take the escrow account you know it's one of those things are it's convenient we take care of or you we pay it and then if you are putting less than twenty percent down\nOn those loan programs you have to have an escrow account because the idea that you're putting limited money down you don't have enough liquid cash laying around that you can handle the big hit for the escrow account ... once a year to pay your own tax payer and insurance so\nI obviously I recommend people just let us saying look for them it's it's cleaner it's easier you can budget monthly instead of worrying about it once a year very good\nVery good okay now that we know that now sometimes and calculating when you're going to get your home loans you might have to put some money up front right because they're very very seldom are going to buy your own exactly on the anniversary of either the or the property taxes or the insurance\nAfter the insurance what happens when you're buying a new home uh the insurance you're going to pay for one year at closing\nAnd then we're going to collect a two month cushion to put in your escrow account right and that cushion is there because taxes and insurance will change a little bit things happened things go wrong\nNow with the taxes you're absolutely right very rarely are you buying a home exactly in November to where we collect robots access to what happens is\nThat we have to figure out how many months of taxes were going to need to let's say you buy your home or in in August right and so if you if you close in August of your first payment is not do you skip September right because you pay interest in her ears\nSo when you close in August ... and then ... will accrue the entire month of September and then you make your first mortgage payment to us on October first\nRight so we'll we'll have gotten in one month from you and then in November we have to pay the taxes are although we're going to be eleven months short\nSo the idea is we have to collect all eleven months at the closing mhm and then you'll receive a tax preparation credit back from the seller\nA show that title company will figure out and say okay well this hour lived in the house through August so they do this many days worth of taxes and they give you a credit back for that and then we put eleven months worth of taxes into your escrow account and so again what ends up being is about three months worth of\nYou have to put about three months in because the sellers putting the rest and you're going to put about three months and then there were in a collective ... they'll collect arrest as we go\nSo they wouldn't November rolls around we have enough money to pay your taxes which is really what what this is all about making sure that your taxes get paid on time and that your insurance gets paid on time because we don't want anyone to have a home and no insurance on it\nAnd as having a forced placed insurance so if you do not as grow and you do not pay your insurance and your insurance gets canceled we didn't have to force placed an insurance policy on you as a service or\nAnd or it's not a very friendly policy it's not it's not something you want to do so we really want our customers to keep their insurance correct keep their taxes current and the easiest way to do that let us handle it to the U.S Ron young\nBank you Robert brings us to the end of the show but

Canadian cannabis company so ray has been on a wild ride in recent months ahead of the legalization recreational marijuana in Canada this past week and there's more good news for candidates friendly Canadians in Canada getting high of marijuana doesn't come to the high cost at least compared with the U.S\nCannabis is significantly cheaper in Canada than in parts of the U.S where it is legal according to a recent report from the data analysis from price ... marketwatch reporter Jake capacity has been looking at this report Jacob what are we learning\nThey basically looked at you know the price of\nA marijuana in different cities across the U.S and Canada\nAnd compared it and what they found is that a candidate says about thirty percent cheaper and Canada than it is and the U.S and that was before it was legalized so what the report basically said was because Kennedy was more widely available in Canada because it's been legal for medical uses\nA for many years now and so there's a wider range of dispenser either there's a wider range of producers in Canada than there is here in the U.S [laughter]\nUm and so they the the researchers basically said because of that um\nThat wider range of production [noise] ah you know in Canada they can supply it more cheaply you know whereas here in the U.S uh you know except for the states where it's legal or illegal at the federal level [noise] and so uh that drives up the cost here in the U.S\nAre so at the medical marijuana has been around a long time and again in the correct\n[noise] yeah it's been around since two thousand one so you know they have a very large legal cannabis industry in Canada and you know that industry with pre easily able to you know kind of transition to white or legality in Canada so\nYou know because they already had that kind of foundation for legal cannabis you know it made things easier and\nAnd you know if you if you work at the videos and stuff coming in from candidate folks are you know kind of easily able to go in and out of the dispensaries and and and pick up what they want\nSpeaking with ... capacity personal finance reporter at marketwatch he's written a piece titled why Americans pay more for weed then Canadians what's the what's the cost breakdown is it done done by adults I guess\nYeah so in Canada it's about twenty eight dollars per is up and down on that but the measurement they use [noise] whereas here in the U. S. it's about forty dollars for an eighth of now so you know for for allowing you know multiply that out to be about like three hundred and twenty dollars\nA year and the U. S. um but that various you know from from city to city um and surprisingly\nWhere it was most expensive was in San Francisco medical marijuana is legal in California but nevertheless you know that there are you in the U. S. where where marijuana is legal you know a lot of states are still having to set up a dispensary if they're still having the you know set up a whole\nYou know kind of ecosystem for the industry because you know they have to do it within that state they can't cross state lines\nBecause the legal at the federal level and for that make things harder and drives up the cost\n... if let's say the U.S were to legalize it on the federal level and let's say we're all fifty states\nFollowed suit and legalize marijuana does that change perhaps the pricing structure supply and demand things like that and we we could be more with Canada\nYeah no so if if you know if it was made legal at the federal level you know you could expect the cost to go down pretty quickly because it would be much easier to produce in the states that already have legalized it at the state level or you know they'd be able to ship it across state lines so that would drop prices and other states\nUm and we could

candidate age\nBased on publicly available and private information induced on securing confidential passion but neither that complain and lord of the candidate was put at risk and so much of the drama\nWe saw on television which\nDamaged both participants significantly\nI could've been done at a time and that the decision could to reach a with regard to whether or not the candidate or they complain complain that was the Bible about doing so much damage so we pretty much get the same outcome\nUm but up but the damage to both parties would be at the end of the appearance of the court\nWould have been or what have been through a stage they reduce them and that's what I was really for it it it helps you get to the meat of a problem provides you with the dice on how to resign\nOh the problem and does show without this massive amount of drama always seemed to be enduring I'm pretty much every major decisions\nAre so how could potentially handle do accusations from the Nineteen eighties\n[noise] well I I I think that that that what it would do is they would go again in ... and and certainly would take the evidence that was presented and would determine whether that evidence reached the threshold of\nA of a decision so in other words if if there was a it looks like this particular case we had a complaint and said that there was an assault attempted rape but no rape jet no location no time no\nAll the things that would fill out a case even on the next day had had happened the day before that would allow prosecutors to bring the pet the case for\nWas named exist and and so I Would likely come back very quickly and say okay we we need these elements otherwise there's no point in frustrating because there's no\nThere's nothing there's no substance here and so it would allow they went dead at Senator Feinstein got a new show no way back in July it would be okay it's doesn't meet the threshold you're going to need these five things you're going to need to go out and get these five things before this has to receive their horses we saw none of those things\nHad been achieved by the time it finally went on to television and so you're either meets the threshold or it does it ... it was a detail what you needed to do to get there and then if you didn't want to do it\nThen that you're just changed and you can certainly still go forward and and tried to disrupt these people's lives but if you want to be successful it will allow you to prioritize your resources\nThe state you could find these other elements in and and make the case rather than just get everybody angry\nAnd we're speaking with tech analyst Rob Enderle a principal and founder of the ... group he's written a piece about how artificial intelligence could help clean up something like the Senate confirmation process for a Supreme Court justice um I guess too though\nThere could be accusations of biased in how the AI was programmed right or how data was input\nAlways always the case that's one of the reasons why I went to IBM and the peace because I get my early on as popped up with a series of procedures\nAnd practices that allow you to ... that I'm biased and and realize a biased day I as problematic on a whole bunch of fun because we're increasingly going to be depending on how to drive our cars or make financial decisions for us make medical decisions for us and so if you if you if you don't eliminate the bias at the front end\nSuddenly you're going to get in procedures that are you don't need or worse could make you sick or you have cars that drive off bridges and uh\nAnd lord knows what's gonna happen to have you got a robot that led to go and say\nAll right thanks for a tech analyst Robin early principal and founder of the ... group
