{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "\n\nWelcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire America One version and bombs and he\nWill go back to do on the radio show a\nWritten article here it was rather interesting stimulated thought processes says what are the top ten markets for long term and dusting as in single family housing I think they're talking about maybe that might be multiple housing also [noise] um but the concept was an interesting one to me and they they\nProduce this a proposal theory there or whatever it is that when you're looking\nFor a long term market to invest in you should be looking for a market in middle range of rent growth and rake growth in value growth\nAnd the theory is if you were in the booming markets like in the past we've had Florida was booming California's blooming or whatever or Phoenix for a while was booming back in two thousand six two thousand seven they were just\nAn hooked um those booming markets are the ones that are most susceptible to any type of a recession that those numbers will come crashing down because the balloon numbers are artificially too high\nThen to say if you're in a really deep recession state\nRight um the question is will come out of that recession or not how long before it comes out of that recessed condition a ... and that might be yet ever right so if you got very low in sluggish growth you may get no growth at all or\nYou might end up like Michigan did for a while or Indiana Gary Indiana Detroit somebody's places um where the city's almost closed down some percentage of the whole city\nAnd you could lose everything so what they're sayings moderate growth city ... they go on to bring up this next term that's rather interesting to see if I could find that term fruit quick and that is um income pricing calculations\nAnd what they're saying is\nWhat you look for what they're looking for for their long term investments is a city where the cost of living\nA is equivalent to the growth of single family or multi family housing costs of housing let's just put it that way\nSo if you live in the city where you can work an average job and afford to pay an average housing check bill income red mortgage whatever\nThen that is sustainable to that area will continue to grow at a moderate rate of growth but a sustainable rate of growth for a long period of time it's not blowing up and it's not dying\nSo that's what they say they're looking for and they're basing it off this ratio between income and housing costs so I thought about that for ... you know\nI I I've seen when you get in the bottom and\nGet into an area that bought in that area and did nothing for long periods of time uh I've also bought in areas that were down that gave me an opportunity for good growth because maybe do in the area was in transition maybe it was an area that was what they call ... changing\nRepositioning itself\nI'm I've been in areas that were overheated\nAnd I've never really liked overheated areas because you pay way too much to buy stuff and so I've never really bought into I mean I've seen him not been in him but I've seen him in I got out of always got out right when things get super super super hot because me rule number one is don't lose money\nAnd if there's going to be a you know there's going to be a bust I don't want to be in that asset when there's a bust on that asset so when things get super super hot I tend to sell take my profits you know and hey wouldn't it be great if you know when the market was coming up\nGet in state until he got up to just about where it got too hot and get out\nThat's been my success for twenty seven Thirty years who investing in real estate I get it when it's low to moderate and I get out before it becomes fire hot so I never buying speculation\nRight never buying speculation yet over the past years I've learned because when I first started I bought really low price really bad area of properties I've learned that that's not that good either\nBecause the problems and the challenges with those areas are not worth it in the long run I did my best on my moderate properties all the stuff I bought in the middle\nEast and it was beautiful stuff in it started in Nineteen Seventy eight construction\nAnd went all the way to Nineteen eighty five construction Seventy to eighty five those eras those modern yours which were either see will be product seeded the product\nIs where I made my kill that's where I got rich quite honestly I my millions came from those properties that era and so I tend to lead these guys who got it now they've given us ten areas they think\nAre the best possible see if we get enough time to get through these ten a number ... ... what I don't know if they're in particular there's got ten that are best Las Vegas\nA has eight percent price increase of two thousand sixteen eleven percent two thousand Seventeen has a one percent variance between housing costs and income Sacramento, California had a southern ... percent last year ten percent this year Minneapolis, Minnesota had five percent last year ... percent this year\nA Ogden, Utah went from eight to ten Fort Worth went from nine to eleven\nGrand Rapids went from eight to ten Portland went from five to eight Boston went from six to eight and Columbus ohio went from seven to eight and all these areas\nHad less than eight ten percent variance between cost of living in income and some of them actually had a negative variants which means\nIt was really cheaper to live there\nThat are you really got paid more than what you could afford to live there very easily use in other words it's positive thing\nSo if that's the case what we're going to do was get herself to some good solid middle line real estate investments that are going just so solidly maintain their growth over a long period of time and that will solidify your family's wealth\nFor your entire generation that's all you need\nAnd periodically if anything changes you're going to change to remember real states like a train you can hear it coming down the tracks unlike a

archived and put up there by date\n[noise] okay\nHere we are with this dilemma about standing standing desk wreck recommendations the headline on the story was standing desk recommendation is based on week science now I reported on some of these studies at the time or\nSome people spend more than half the day setting they said average much of a much of the sitting time is where\nFor over an hour\nAt work for a back in the car for another hour\nThat's ten go home ate dinner\nFigure a half hour forty five minutes maybe an hour that's eleven watch TV\nFor a couple of hours that's about Thirteen fourteen you know you can get the Fifteen hours sitting no trouble at all [noise]\nThink about that [noise]\nThey're saying ah you know\nTheir day ... it's more than half I suspect\nThat is a operational definition for sedentary life\nStyle now with that comes along this whole business about standing now we know we weren't we did not naturally select to sit through evolution\nAbsolutely not [laughter] so\nPeople thought OK standing is better that's the answer is standing desks right oh wow that the proponents of that particular modality uh say that a eliminating sitting from your work life\nIs almost as beneficial as quitting smoking\nI always you know I don't know about that question it I don't think so\nI Know it and I know the literature and I know the literature on smoking\n[noise] as smoking is\nAlmost a death sentence\n[noise] early early death [noise]\nAnd ... and ... leading up to it is not a good thing and it's you know at the terrible habit\nAnd it's a hard one to break [noise]\nBut sedentary lifestyle does have serious health risks we know that as well ... there's a risk for cardiovascular disease there's a risk for cancer there's a risk for early death sedentary lifestyle is not good either\n[noise] well it twenty sixteen meta analysis of twenty studies\nThat's where they take all these studies\nAnd they collapse if you will or collect the findings and there was some statistical models and manipulations they call those data together\nIt was conducted by the finish Institute of occupational health and including more than two thousand participants in the study\nWell they found they said\nNot so much\nEvidence very little evidence that standing or\nOr treadmill desks as I alluded to a moment ago\nAny health benefits for the some of the people at their desk pour their hair or even the best studies they said ah were poorly designed\nThis is often an issue [noise] it's you know the methods and\nProcedures man [noise] a as a researcher I can tell you that\nYou can find statistical significance but you know how did you get there [noise]\nAnd sometimes these studies are ... poorly designed by design nevertheless they would they were small sample size is a God Knows what else [noise]\nAnd what they concluded was no follow up in those studies either\n[noise] that [noise] [noise]\nBuying is standing desk they said may reduce your sitting time by his little is thirty two minutes a day [noise]\nThat's what they concluded [noise]\nI Know people that have standing desks and they'll stand two or three hours at a time\n[noise] but guess what you're still not moving [noise]\nYou're still stationary\n[noise] and standing has a lot of ... uh extended standing has a lot of deleterious effects\n[noise] yeah the the heart has to pump still ... bright and you're standing and it has to pump maybe even a little harder\nUm and the claim that burns twice as much calories as setting a Harvard study found that standing burned only eight more calories than our than sitting so that that claim is called into question\n[noise]\nBy standing for long periods of time can be also deleterious to your health is I'm alluding to study twenty Seventeen study in the American Journal of epidemiology track more than seven thousand people over twelve years we come back I'll tell you what they found [noise]\nYou know mark my words\nToday is what October the force you mark my words on this day won't be long gone the another study come out about how standing is good\nSo this is a back and forth but I'll I'll give you my evaluation of this I'm back and forth and what I think is going on I've been thinking about buying a standing I resisted I I think I mentioned the Gary more than a few times as it you know maybe I'm

I Would never try to walk and work at that pace so it's it's really just a matter of moving versus doing nothing so you are walking extremely slowly and I have to admit\nI Am not very proficient at walking in typing I have tried and it doesn't go well for me I think people can get good at that if they practice but for something like a radio show or a weapon or or a conference call it's wonderful to be able to get up and move instead of doing that thing what\nGet what got you on to doing that you just had was a just a thought that somebody encouraged you what what what inspired you to do it\nWell it was initially this feeling of I was sitting too much and simply I was sitting on I felt like I could be moving getting certain things like like a radio show for example and wanting to be moving more throughout the day and knowing that\nStanding wasn't the ... of the good alternative and I agree with that um I'm not surprised that the studies are supportive of standing because really from a physiological sense it doesn't make any more than ... is not any better for you would and possibly worse than just sitting in terms of the the\nWork that your heart has to do to keep that blood moving\nThat try anything I made that point yet then you have ...\nWrite a book that get implicated or let me ask you this I Know you came to talk about you have something on the menu for you that you wanted to serve up here but what what do you make of sitting a sitting is the new smoking I\nI I Will tell you what I think what do you think about that\nWell I don't think it's quite as toxic smoking perhaps but it is something that is surprisingly harmful\nOr you know being century encountered jubilee leads to inflammation and it's not good for our cardiovascular health and human so we just weren't made to fit all day long or be inactive or skill\nWhich she ... she's repeating everything ... says a little boy [laughter] I Would have almost word for word I said we didn't naturally ... we didn't naturally select the revolution\nTo sit we naturally selected to move it was moving and that's what this new study suggests it's not the extensive sitting except extensive standing both are deleterious to the health you got to keep moving and move every\nHour or so get up and move even if you walk only a few minutes\nOr that's what they're suggesting no I don't buy into sitting as does new smoking I don't I haven't bought into that\nYeah great I don't think it's quite that extreme bike it may be the unhealthy habit that you know some are non smokers have yeah\nBoy it takes a lot of work and a lot of fun to stay healthy doesn't it [laughter] a lot of movement and a lot of movement or are you home today you moved into a new place\nNew place new home office nice fresh start so but I tell you know a box city here still getting organized [laughter] but I found my phone [laughter]\nOh so you so you've met Dr ... go then and his box city to his I just moved to a new home to either hung out there you go yeah\nStressful oh neither in either go into therapy [laughter]\nKnow I mean it's it's wonderful to you know the fresh start and and all that but why is it stressful [noise]\nYeah it it it is so much I mean then you're then you get conflict to do I keep this or do I throw it away\nDr Kate welcome back um so I thought you would appreciate those quotes uh I Know you disagree with it as well the science does not support that view or as much as they would like the reader or the listener to believe you have any comment I\nKnow that that's absolutely right it\nHow these studies are reported\nAre often so twisted against multi vitamins [noise] um you know and and the largest I mean\nYou know literature views are are tricky to begin with even though they are they carry a lot of weight you know meta analysis it sounds very technical and yet they're still is an absolutely um you know a process of picking and choosing cherry picking your studies and so you can include or not include whatever studies you watch and come up with whatever conclusion the one\nI'm In and then there are newer studies where they do long term trials\nAnd the one of the best ones with you know as you're aware of the physicians health study where they follow them roughly Fifteen thousand\nPhysicians a male physicians starting from the age of fifty and half of whom took a placebo and and a half hour from didn't and one of the biggest ah ... ah you know results are finding that were published out of this study is that among this group but generally heart\nHealthy individuals that multi vitamins did not lowered the risk of heart attack amongst the people who are healthy and so the headlines that came out where multi vitamins don't help you multi vitamins are useless which is so misleading because in fact when you look at the study even just around heart health amongst the individuals who\nHad heart cardiovascular health in fact taking a multivitamin did seem to reduce the incidence of heart attacks well similarly were seemed to reduce the incidence of cancer [noise]\nUm and these things are just not reported in that way those don't make the headlines\nIn my view I Do not think and I have never set on air I've never written I have never given a talk I have never alluded to the idea that taking supplements will cure anything\nFirst of all generally neither do pharmaceuticals and secondly to assert for someone to say\nA a multi vitamin will prevent cancer or cure cancer that person would be very suspect in my mind I read about their credibility or that it's going to prevent a heart attack\nNot true\nSupplements cannot out paste out run the weight of the variants associated with diet and lifestyle Dr Kate\nOf you and I both know that um and that's what the supplements Warren intended to do that and that's that's where these doctors like a and I'll say his name is Dr David ... he's on CBS I've seen him on CBS and Josh\nRifle through a a a heavy criticism of dietary supplements\nAnd I'm sitting there thinking Dr ... and he's smart he and he knows better and he says things are just not true the sciences there when I can take 'em in the ... met or any database and shown thousands of studies and so could you so it gets frustrating doesn't it\nIt really does it and it's because it's the message that gets out is not serving people it's not serving the public good\nAnd it is shaking people's confidence in Hempel inexpensive and get that they can take back the odds in their favor just that can be a healthy lifestyle just part of healthy lifestyle\nGo ahead Gary you wanted to jump in there\nWell you never see you never heard anybody come out and say oh you should eat bad food you should eat unhealthy food they've never come out and said that so why would you say something about taking\nBut yes they have really yeah\nWhat do you think all those commercials are well that's commercials I mean like a dog a lot of what are they telling people to do well the yeah I don't say it's on the healthy food but it is unhealthy food everybody knows it's unhealthy food [laughter] it's it's a lie in broad daylight\nThey do tell you to eat those foods those foods are unhealthy bake processed foods high and salt sugar and fat Dr ... you know this account for a lot of the barriers of some of these chronic diseases or contribute to them don't they\nOh yes so in the sense scary they do they do\nIn the ... I mean they're not saying this route is unhealthy we solid go buy it they don't say that right but you get let's go to let's go to Clarksville Georgia [noise]\nMr Mr Potter\nAlmost dies\nOr ... years there may be a pain what's on your mind\nHey I just want to call in your dark buried or natural factor vitamin here and a lot of other ... for ... for natural factor\nYou know the horrific figure line and everything and you know you're right it is a lifestyle bone you know if you've ever primary\n... out there for people that are covered number ... Alamo on air I don't feel good I argue on a whole food prior to ... well no ... no not at ... park that's all they were good old ... ... what are you doing what do you eat you know because the vitamin ... here about a ... you know\nYou've got ... ... it is amazing when you put on your body going out a larger body like the whole PC vitamin through yeah but it is it fair for your wife fell doc\nAbsolutely absolutely indicate makes a very important point you've got to talk in the second hour cut her loose completely and she'll talk about [noise] multiples from natural factors and the their benefit\nSo we just wanted to clear the deck of that we're not going to we're not making these ridiculous claims and we're not saying it cures cancer that will raise Lazarus from the dead or make you walk on water [laughter] we don't do that around here and Dr Kate would never do that\nBut she can make a cogent and a very convincing argument [noise] generally as to why supplementation is a good idea and why multiple vitamins are very specifically a very specific good idea to K.

[noise] downloaded now\nUm yeah it's one of things you could probably get away with but it's really not truthful and in compliance with the language on the VA more here so I I Would definitely discouraged that I'm sure there's some mortgage companies out there that would happily help him do that but at the end the day really doesn't meet the language in the VA mortgage and and it's really gets down to the issue on both sides are you know on the other home\nYou know in the mortgage and says that if if if RJ is no longer living in that home that\nAnd so if he moves out in the wife is there and the wife named on the mortgage the only only RJ is on the loan they are both obviously entitled because they're married so of our day moves out a there is a clause in the mortgage that says that if you know if if you leave that house and indeed it to someone else that the the bank\nHas the right to call the new do so far J takes himself off the deed is a part of the the the divorce and gives it over to the ex wife and she didn't continue to make payments on art is on mortgage the bank technically has the right to come in and and call that mortgage do because the the the loan holder has defeated their interest to a third party who they're no longer married to\nAnd they're not making the payments now the likelihood of that happening is very low you know I mean legally and technically it can happen I've never seen it happen or you know we see this in cases where someone passes away\nAnd the air's continue to make payments on alone again technically the bank has the right to call that loan do a very you know like I said I've never seen it happen I'm sure it has happened somewhere somewhere along the line\nBut as long as the payments are being made a chance to the bank to come in and called the new do are slim but legally based on a language in the mortgage that is a possibility and that's where they would try to get people to understand is it a lot of things you agree to that mortgage document\nThere's some hard and fast rules out there when it comes to offers out of the blue there will promise you some sort of settlement first off as Robert should use rule number ... will inject that company out sixteen ways to Sunday another rule that we'd be ruined number five\nSays if you know their tricks you only fall for them as you listen to Robert bummer you'll be educated more and more on scams and tricks and what not to fall prey to\nWhere these rules well they're part of the Fifteen saving thousands rules to success\nSee Robert created these guidelines based on many many years in the financial industry and the thousands of credit reports he reviewed you're one of those things are Fifteen saving thousands rules to test\nSimply log on to saving thousands dot com and click on the tab labeled the rules\nGetting back to the rule number five if you know they're tricked you won't fall for them one of the worst smoke and mirrors examples his\nAuto pay and the fans are everything their financial services industry has put together was built to turn you into a financial zombie\nWho just meanders around you bump into a fence and your bum go the other way or you hear noise over there and you just turning manner that way and and you're not paying attention to anything there is no higher reasoning there's no conscious thinking when it comes to personal finance\nOh we're going to turn 'em on the financial zombies and then we're going to take advantage of them make a whole bunch of money or that stops here and now on the saving thousands radio network\nI'm going to turn you all into financial ninjas and we're going to follow the rules were going to make better decisions were going to save a bunch of money more importantly we're not going to be taken advantage of\nAnd we're going to make a difference because trust me when they realized this stuff isn't working anymore they'll stop doing it it's that simple how do we fight back in when\nWe follow the rules we take back power as consumers and we force an industry who has been going down a really bad path for probably the last forty years to reverse course and start putting us versus consumers again\nOne of the things that came up the other day that I Hope we have a chance to discuss on a lengthy basis is a lot of the commercials now come on and they offer you a bottle of some kind of energy bill or diet pills or live better pill and they say the first one hundred capsules are free to the first thousand collars\nThe problem is they still ask for your credit card Robert and then they the thirty days after you've got that first bottle it shows up on your credit card statement does your does bottom number two here comes bottle number three and when you try to cancel that it's almost impossible you have to cancel\nOn the third day of the week of the fourth moon or something and you never get it out of your credit I liked that problem you had with that credit card companies so many years ago\nYeah let me tell you at convenience is code for we're going to screw you and I mean maybe I make that a rule [laughter] uh you know knowing honestly look that they don't care about your convenience All right but what they know is Otto pay\nYou know that they call those continuity programs by the way route I didn't know what it was called ... it's a huge I mean in the marketing world is called continuity programs I Know and if the huge way for companies to make money I mean the auto bill diet it's the auto pay with a product attached to it\nBut uh anything that that you think makes your life more convenient right or we've talked about an online bill payer on online statements right why did the credit card companies push you so hard toward on line statements they claim\nIt's to save the environmental yes they claim it's for your own convenience but in reality it's to hide a bunch of disclaimer is from you that were made a requirement under the card act that was passed a couple of years ago where they have to put in big bold print how much you're spending an interest and how much faster you could pay that card off\nIf you just send a couple of extra dollars and that's required to be in big bold print on a PDF or the downloaded statement so what are they going to do they're going to drive your little snapshot screen on your mobile phone that doesn't have that information in the name of convenience\nAnd the name of the environment they don't care about the environment they don't care about your personal convenience they care about making money off of you All right let's not confused any of that so\nUh this is all about financial zombie a yeah give me your credit card and just let me bill you whenever I Want give me your bank account let me draft the payment whenever I Want car insurance homeowner's insurance\nAll of these things because what they know and they test this how much can we charge 'em\nBefore they realize it and get wise right so let's let's bumped him five bucks that's Muslim eight bucks that's Muslim three bucks let's try to figure out how much we can get away with before somebody wakes up and says well\nThis is too expensive I didn't agree to pay this right but they know with auto pay your financial zombie you're just out there meandering around looking for the next brain to chew on and I'm not paying attention to wear your money's going\nI figured out another thing after we had that discussion the other day if you simply get it on your your smartphone\nYou only look it up when you're thinking about it but you know if that bill arrives in the mail and you put it in your hot little hands you're going to probably pay at the right time the way you've taught him to pay it but if it's just if it's just somewhere out there in the cloud and you've got to go find it\nWhat about my first Omaha bank account yep when does it do well I haven't thought about that because it's not in my hand\nYeah it's a technology has made us lazy and and financial services companies credit card companies banks have realized that they can capitalize on our laziness right I mean why do people in our shop around laziness ... that's it you know\nOr even worse they think their shopping around but they're using websites that are on the take\nAnd it only showing the cards items that pay a money\nYou know like ... you know bank rate dot com right sure ... supposed to be a huge so resource where you can find the best mortgage\nGuesses mortgage you won't find on their mind you won't find our findings writes on there you won't find a zero closing costs refinance might be funding on their why because I have to pay them a ton of money to be lifted there\nAnd I can pay them and give you a great deal that's right and so this whole shopping portal thing again it it it's smoke and mirrors it's to confuse you it's tricks and so you've got to do it yourself or you've got to do it with a trusted resource right\nThat brings us again to rule number twelve urging us to check out companies before doing business with them and add to that rule number one always shop around you know what you're saying much better chance of not being ripped off\nWell last week we talked about items on their credit report good items in bed items and we have a question from a listener who wants to know if I pay off enclosed in the ... through the previously been reported this delinquent will it be removed from my credit report faster or or just stay there to haunt me\nKind of reminds me either three dollar pass do on your discovery card years ago you close that as soon as you found out\nI and so on I Will tell you and he I don't have heart prove this but from my experimenting and tinkering with credit reporting or it once you closing account the fact that it was previously to Lincoln\nAnd so the whole purpose of the show the whole reason I come on here every day if they try to expose those tricks and to try to give people right information and and sometimes it is a trick\nAnd sometimes it's just misinformation that could still is not trying to trick anybody\nYou know that with with that they just are\nThey're they're they're just they're spreading misinformation they're not trying to trick you they have no benefit from giving you a wrong home valuation they can't give you are right when so thoroughly choice you know that they crunch this data and all of a sudden it gets picked up and get smaller publicity I mean look at clearly work\nBecause I'm Talking about um well they're talking about here on this David Dobbs radio network in you know because they put out a bogus report everybody else is talking about how great it is and how wonderful it is for people in Orlando and Tampa in Miami I yeah I'm Talking about how crazy they are and how wrong they are\nBut they they that the whole thing there is no bad publicity so that's why they do it they're not trying to trick you they're just trying to to grow their business and grow their stock price but others\nThe financial services companies are trying to trick us they try to trick is every day and I'm here to expose that because once you know the trick it doesn't work\nOr you know what they got is millions of dollars worth of free publicity and they got some ... which I don't think they deserve personally but they were quoted in Wall Street journal quoted and monies are quoting Bloomberg soul of a sudden they're in authority well that's what they sold the bill of goods Syria\nIt is here and now now again we're going to have local homebuyers making bad decisions and guess when the home buyers and realize they were wrong when they get out bit\nHome buyers they lose their house if they listen to this so you know we went in the home when a homeowner\nCaesar wrong value for their house because they use the the the estimate they now make wrong decisions right ... you know they may make the wrong decision to stay the wrong decision to sell the wrong decision to refinance not refinance get a he locked ... don't sell stay move\nAll these decisions are based on home value\nAnd so they're misinformation is causing people to make wrong decisions you can't make the right decision that right information and now this article has the potential to get home buyers to low ball offers and lose at home because of misinformation and and nothing upsets me more\nIf you go out there and hold yourself as an authority you've got to spread information that is accurate and that is beneficial for the consumer and beneficial for us\nAnd that is not what they do you've heard Robert refer\nTo the fifteens saving thousands rules to success you'll see the complete listed are companion website saving thousands dot com what else was there you'll find articles\nAudio features past additions of this show and replays of the popular radio show money minutes\nRobert we kicked off the show at the top of the hour with financial advice based on the Fifteen saving thousands rules to excess I Love those rules where do you say we review some of the actual rules themselves and have you explain them\nLet's recap the rules Rob we've we've talked about these are real number one always shop around all purchases banks ATM fees credit cards mortgages life insurance car insurance I could go on and on real number one here on saving thousands of always shop around\nRule number two is no your numbers I Know your numbers this is your credit score we've talked a lot about that that this week how to distribute items\nOr the balances on your cards the interest rates on your cards car loans mortgages everything\nA sudden you've got to know your numbers I rule number three is the three day rule\nUh this is the pledge that all of us financial and then just\nHere on the saving thousands radio network before we take on any type of major purchase or before we apply for any type of credits or take out any type of new loan we're going to think about it for three days I this was a it seems to be a rule that was used in dating\nAnd one that I I've inaccurately tried to use on my now wife uh and uh but it's much better when applied to finance not so good when applied to romance so three day rule re wait three days before we make any decisions on a large purchase and it really doesn't empower you when when you're sitting there with that pushy sales guy\nAnd he's like you know when he leans any he offers you the Penn\nRight you know like like these these Nineteen sixties closing techniques I go I Would you like to use my pen or your pin\nI don't need a pennant all thank you I'm going to wait three days before I make a decision you know well what can we do to get you to commit today you can't do anything to get me to commit today because I'm going to wait three days because I listen to Robert Palmer on the same dozens radio network and I'm their father three day rule\nIt's a good way for you to push off that pushy sales guy it's a good way to push off that that clerk in line at the department store is trying to sell you a high interest rate credit card would you like to sign up for your whatever car today to save twenty percent\nWould love to but I have to take that pamphlet go home and read it and wait three days and make a decision and if I still think it's a good idea I Will come back here and buy more of your glass or whatever it is I'm buying and I just can't then so that's the that's the three day rule that the the first three rules was talking about a lot\nA so moving on and maybe some new territory from our listeners are real number for\nA is we're not going to abuse credits but we're not going to fear it either\nRight Syrian or don't abuse credit this big you know but don't fear it either that the solution is not to just have no credit the solution is not to bury your head in the sand and be afraid of credit\nAnd and think that you can get through life with nothing and no credit score because let me tell you where where maybe ten or Fifteen Years ago you could ... uh we're moving more and more and more toward a society where the credit score is used in so many parts of your life\nFrom insurance to any type of business financing I mean there's just so many ways that score is being used\nOr that you can't ignore it and and you know we we we we maybe had a chance as consumers to fight this trend that ship has sailed\nA it is getting more and more mass appeal to businesses into all aspects of our life\nSo we can't be afraid of credit the other reason is there's ways you can take advantage of credit and you can make money you could arbitrage you can uh you know you can take advantage of that six months interest free and invest your money in in a mutual fund and make some cash you can you can take advantage of that that car deal where it's six months interest free and put your money to work somewhere else\nOr there or you can take advantage of airline miles you know I get a couple of nice vacations a year off of my American Express points\nAnd if I was afraid of credits yeah I've got the money I don't have to use credit I could pay cash for everything I could use a debit card for everything that's another issue we've talked about is a waste of using a ... I may have to make that her little robbed ...\nAnd he's with an answer and then you just don't use debit cards I think I may jump out there and be that bold with it\nUm so all these things you can't be afraid of credit I just it doesn't work and uh so what I'm going to do here on the show was going to teach you how to use credit to your advantage that's what we do but you've got to have it you can't ah life with zero debt\nOr with zero credit just doesn't work in today's society now I'm not saying be a slave then not saying Barry yourself\nBut you know there's some great tax benefits to having a mortgage there's a lot of benefits to using credit cards and they just paying them off every month if you pay 'em and full every month during the grace period you gotta costs yourself in the interest but you're able to take advantage of\nThe miles or the the rebates that the protections right there's all these great things there that's real number four don't abuse credit but don't fear it either\nA real number five is if you know their tricks they won't work right and so for this you know I I\nI really do believe and I know from experience that big financial services companies absolutely use tricks\nOr to try to confuse us and get us to overspend get us and not pay our bills on time or you know we talked about the trick of of trying to get consumers to go paperless\nYou know they want you to to give up getting paper statements and deliver them trying to say because then they can hide all the disclosures that's the trick because then you don't know how much money you could say by paying it off in three years instead of Twenty years by only sending an extra ten dollars a month\nYou know these these are the tricks they want you to sign up for that credit card in line when you're not paying attention when you're not asking questions like what's the annual the what's the a PR\nThey want you to float that mortgage rate they want you to not lock and they want to let you float around out there and flop around as a floater you know has no control their destiny and give them all the power back that's one of the tricks\nAnd as a consumer if we know the tricks they don't work anymore they they can't trick us if we know what they're trying to do so will number five if you know their tricks they don't work\nIf you're new to the show you might be wondering where did the Fifteen saving thousands rules to success come from anyway well Robert Palmer owns a very successful mortgage company and before starting a company he had spent years in the mortgage industry\nNow imagine the tens of thousands of reading reports credited applications and actual potential borrowers that he's studied Robert found that there were stark differences between the people who have good credit\nAnd those with low scores\nHe saw trends in financial habits and from that he was compelled to create the ... the easy to understand easy to follow guidelines about money error go the Fifteen saving thousands rules All right Robert speaking of those rules let's get back to them\nReal number six or you've got to spread your knowledge you've got to educate your friends and family you know for so long money and finance and credit scores was this taboo and and nobody wanted to talk about it\nAnd I think that the newer generation the younger generation coming up as more open to talking about it\nYou know there there's no there's no shame there there's I mean why why are we afraid to talk about it and I honestly believe that this fear this taboo was created by big financial services companies the financial services industry because by keeping us from being willing to talk about it\nThe tricks will work more they can confuse us more we don't have the power of our core group and our support group and our friends and family knowing what's going on you know no one wants to tell their friends and family they have bad credit score\nHe told me to go home for three days of sleep on it he told me to go check out the competitor and see what their prices and he told me to go test drive the Honda even though he's selling kids and to make sure I didn't like it better and I liked it the best so I'm going back and I'm going to tell my friends that I I I\nWould guarantee you it's counterintuitive as it seems to him they would sell more cat cars how they're not going to make as much money per car\nBecause you know what a lot of companies they live to take advantage of that one poor guy who doesn't shopper up right and so don't let that be you right now don't lead don't let you be the poor sucker who didn't shop around who gets taken advantage of but that's how a lot of businesses right and that's how the mortgage industry is and that's how I was in a lot of years of my career\nBut when you realize that by not doing that by giving everybody a great deal and caring about every consumer and taking care of every consumer\nOr the benefits of the word of mouth and the the\nYou know the the fact that people do trust you and do want to do business with you and it's not this adversarial relationship where you know you go high five your sales manager 'cause you got him\nAnd then he goes home and that is so upset because he realized he got taken three days later when they realized what he could have gotten the car for or what rating could've gotten or how many bees he paid they're gonna hate you\nAnd and you're not walk past customers hating you that's not good business is right it's not good business at all\nRobert believes in that business philosophy so much\nThat his company or the funding customers are asked to review the services are getting several times during the mortgage process in fact the actual will pay for staff members is usually affected by those reviews\nTake a look at your own operation and see where it can be more transparent and more customers driven\nAgain credit is such a major factor in so many areas of our lives folks you just don't think about it\nWe're not only talking credit cards and loans of every type but their credit score is used in setting your insurance rates and there's even part of the criteria used by some companies when it comes to hiring you\nSo take advantage of your free credit reports each year keep track of your credit as you would the cash in your very wallet\nOkay now I have a question from a listener John over in ... city wants to buy a second home and he wants to use it as a rental house currently brings in eight Seventy five a month in rent now the question is\nCan he used the rental income as part of his income information when applying for his mortgage\nSo first off or you use the word second home\nAnd then you talked about a rental threat that problem that's a problem right so and again I get that Jonathan's not in the industry and he probably doesn't mean what we mean by second home but I Do want to explain to our audience that\nAre there there are three types of residences when it comes to finance okay and these make a difference to us because they carry different levels of risk and they have different interest rates are the first is your primary residence ... I then when we use the term second home in the industry\nOr weren't talking vacation home right so this is a home that you're going to spend time and you are not going to rent it out this is your second home this is your vacation home\nI and what we find is there is a lower risk to us as a lender for someone who is buying a vacation home that they're going to ... to use personally or the rest of the home they're planning on renting out and the reason is if you're buying a vacation home for your own personal use\nYou are planning on making the payment out of your personal funds for the entire year mhm if you are buying an investment property that means you are planning on hopefully having a tenant's re rent or who makes the payment for you\nSo what happens if said tenant or said rent or does not make a payment for you what happens if they lose their job what happens if if they flake out what happens if they pack up the middle of night and disappear now you don't have the money coming in today that payment and you are never planning on paying the payments out of your own money\nThe way you were if you were buying a vacation home that you are just going to have and you're like hey you know honey we're doing well this year\nWe love to go down to new Smyrna beach let's buy a little condo on the ocean over there and we're not going to rent it out we're just going to use it for personal use\nWe can afford the thousand dollars a month in our budget let's do it let's reward ourselves now that's different than saying I'm going to buy a condo and I'm going to rent it out I'm going to make money off of it and all of a sudden if I ever had to pay that thousand a month that I own pocket\nWill be in trouble and so again Rob this again gets in the risk so if you can afford the rental property without a tenants than if things go wrong\nYou will qualify you'll be okay you can do it the payment if the only way you can afford that rental property is by having a tenant in there and by utilizing their rent\nTo offset the payment what happens when the tenant moved out what happens when a tenant filed bankruptcy what happens when the tent can't make the payment you now cannot afford to make the payment so while there are some loan programs that will allow us to consider the potential rental income of it as an investment property\nThey have a lot of other gadgets we want to see a lot of monster reserves and we want to see a lot of history maintaining rental properties it's not just an easy yes and my personal advice is\nIf you cannot afford the rental property\nWithout being vacant if you can't afford to go twelve I Want you to sit there right now and say if I had to go twelve months old without a tenant\nWould it destroy my life's financially\nAnd if the answer is yes then don't buy their own property because you never know ... and the last thing you want to do\nAnd I understand why people by rental properties mean they're they're trying to better themselves they're trying to build for wealthy they're trying to expand their financial situation\nBut if you are not in a financial situation where you can afford to go twelve months and will you ever have to go twelve months probably not but who knows I mean who would've ever thought home prices could drop\nThe way they drop all in all eight nine ... rock so if you can't afford to go twelve months without getting a dime of rent my advice to you\nIs do not buy that rental property do not take the risk do not put your finances in jeopardy by taking on something you can't handle by a smaller rental property right maybe you've got maybe you've got twenty or thirty thousand dollars the down payment so you're thinking you're going to buy a nice little hundred thousand dollar investment property\nGo buy a thirty thousand dollar investment property cash or by sixty thousand dollar investment property and have the mortgage be low enough that you could afford to pay it the other thing I Will tell you to be cautious of the same conversations we just had\nIf sixty thousand dollar home a\nIs a condo and monthly dues or a thousand dollars a month or yeah that will be more than your mortgage payment this is a problem I still keep all that in mind you've got to look at the homeowner's association or condo do the property taxes and here's the other guy she wouldn't invest our property you don't get to file homestead exemption\nSo if you're buying a house right so if I'm buying robs house Rob lived in the house Rob had homestead exemption and now he's selling it to me and it's going to be my rental property the county will find out that there is no longer an owner occupant there they will revoke the homestead exemption and the taxes will go up\nBy seven eight nine dollars a year I'd\nSay instantly so don't be fooled is you're looking at it and saying well these property taxes are only a thousand dollars a year\nOr the person you're buying it from has lumps setting that didn't you didn't bother counting and find out what the property\nTax bill will be winning betting on property\nAnd there is no longer homes that exemption leg robbery that brings us

of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't do\nThat you point out there's a really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of back up\nSo I'm yet so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots did all those can be altered\nUm have mandated a California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines um have to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets scanned at the machine or um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are looking at that paper after a collection is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cyber security journalist also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of elections security how do we get so vulnerable\nOh we got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nUh in that case I'm sure everyone recalls the dangling Chad while you're um that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington did she decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh systems and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any papers at all and that's how we got the more we have today\nAre about like in the coming years you get the sense that we won't have as many issues as we have now\nI think the problem is is that we have we have had this um ah for a bill a bill has come in Congress ah since\nUm let's say four or five times a since this all happened in in two thousand trying to

to America's first news this weekend was Gordon the\nFirst of all weekend in October glad you could share it with this theory a subject you're wire sexual assault victims not always willing to come forward the reasons are many years this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] some of them have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I it's even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex I fill many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be read traumatizing to revisit that to help people go over the details again a and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so others that deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often that sometimes there somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong I went to that party\nI had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not\nAnd so there's that self blame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there is some evidence of physical harm why is that\nBecause then they face feels like they will be beliefs of the huge fear is that I Am going to put myself out there I'm going to relive my trauma and no one's going to do it publicly people now know these shameful details it's you know facts as a private thing to begin with even when it's consensual and nice\nAnd people are gonna know these horrible details in my life and no one's going to believe me right so these these physical injuries that somebody has or at least physical ... they're visible press that something happened to me\nLet's talk about the victims you actually know the person which seems to be somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives tumbling at it like that does that make it that much more complicated\nYes especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this person in the hall you see this person around the country club wherever you are\nAnd so um you're you're scared aid that they will get angry at you and there'll be some retaliation and um but you're also scared of being ostracized ostracized so uh you know will people again in this victim blaming society will people\nSay that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's something called cognitive dissonance when something we can get our mind around some things that we so someone says hey this person you know\nAnd guess what it work for the phone continue to work after each each bill\nWhat what did you find that there were any kind of limits to this [noise]\nNot really I mean I mean technically they're Olympics I mean you know there's something called ... which is basically a standard which which basically means that if the phone that meets that standard can be submerged in freshwater for up to two meters for up to half hour [noise]\nNow you know we didn't keep the iPhone and the coke for example the beer for more than a couple of minutes [laughter]\nReally not even that I'm so in that sense I guess [noise]\nYou know think about it and real world terms but if you are sitting on your desk can you spell coffee on it you know what are you going to do even to dry it off immediately and that's what you're supposed to do by the way\nWe're speaking with it may get us H J he drowned the iPhone and a bunch of liquid to see how it would hold up it's an important distinction to make because water resistant does not mean water proof\nCorrect correct and technically you're not supposed to swim with these I Do know people who do and they've come out fine but you know apple will tell you to do that and I'm certainly not telling you to do that I mean the idea Israeli or to prevent an action you know you're\nYou drop it in a pot or or you know or you you know by the seashore and suddenly a big wave comes in it's it\nIt's that kind of thing you're not meant to swim with it though is a shame technically you can um keep the phone at least the standard ... you can keep the phone and fresh water for up to about two meters for a half hour or so I guess you could swim in it under those circumstances\nAre the phones I'm more durable than they've been or is this the standard we'd be carrying around on\nWell we've heard it before but apple says yes indeed that um you know this is the most durable clash they've ever went on and I found I did not do drop trash I Know a couple of people who did and some people are reported no problems there were a couple of ... marks couple of people I talk to\nAgain apple claims it's it's the most horrible but it doesn't necessarily mean shatter proof so you know again my advice is don't push it to the limit\nYeah when you're trying to figure out um I mean is it best to\nStand it up rights so maybe any or sideways to that [noise] more strict can leak out of whatever buttons are holes may be in it\nUm I don't know the standard way to dry it I mean I literally just took a paper towel and try and get dried up that way I didn't do anything scientific here but and again it was fine and we did ... saying you know there's pictures if you [noise]\nYou know direct people to the article at USA

business trends analyst he shakes his head at the amount of debt that we've accumulated he's based in Long Beach California ... what kind of economy we're looking at\nWhat we're looking at a at a comedy that's doing well I Can't argue with the numbers is doing well but wearing a debt bubble caught me at all bubbles eventually burst you cannot keep going economy can't keep going by adding more debt faster than the economy is growing and that's exactly what we're doing and the quality of the debt now\nIs actually worse than it was at the peak in two thousand seven right before we had the
