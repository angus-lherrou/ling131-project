{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WHNZ", "content": "\nWelcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire American one person at a monthly flow\nBack to do on the radio show today we've been talking about um different aspects of why your life is so mediocre and you know you think about like the ideal man lay off me\nAnd in my point of view is look\nIf you wanted me to lay off of you you wouldn't listen to the park yeah she really listening because it's caught your attention I Know when I listen to guys that are bombastic and um when I listen to guys that really are way ahead of me financially and it's like they they look back where you're at and they talk about\nYou know I really didn't get it back then I hadn't really figured it out yet I feel that same way at every level at every level of come through\nBeing more and more successful from the very beginning when I quit my job and was able to survive on my single family houses to when I bought my small apartment complexes uh and started learning more and more money and then I bought medium size apartments than larger apartment support at every level that I pass through I Want you to understand\nThat every level was an additional learning curve\nEvery level created fear\nYou know I I was just scared to by single family houses when I started with them\nBut I was just excited at the returns that I was getting from those single family houses if you're out there and you're a beginner and you're listening to this big numbers I'd throw around the you know get a religious Thirty years of doing this so it's really not I'm not even proud to throw that out I probably should have ten times more money than what I have I just wasn't that aggressive\nUm but if you're back they're starting where I started out where most people start at is that you and you've got to get out there and you've got to just change your mind you need to self educate yourself that's the most important thing\nAnd then you need to start thinking about your family's wealth as a business and not think about your family's money as little bill is college fund for get little Billy if you're a millionaire by the time Billy goes to college don't you think you can afford to send Billy to college\nDon't save for college by in a bar but complex and make enough money in that apartment complex can not only make you rich but pay his way through college\nWhen he's done with college you still have the apartment complex you still have the income and it'd be worth even more so get rid of the little Billy college fund\nGet rid of the um ... retirement fund you don't need a retirement fund you don't need a pile of money sitting there doing nothing for you to die with\nOr to rather live off of before you die you need investments what you need to do is replaced short earned income with past week I get that money out of the four one K. get it out of the IRA\nDopey uh Dave Ramsey fool and pay off your home get the money out of your personal house that money could earn enough money to retire on what is the house do anyway sheet rock carpet and paid it's nothing you can live anywhere\nBut what you can do is replace your income if you don't have any money to invest you need to get out there and get the money that you have invested you need to think about your family as a business what is your business your family's business producing\nIs it producing anything yes or no\nIf it's not producing why\nWhy are you letting it you're the c._e._o. your company will sit down at dinner tonight and go\nOkay family I had a paycheck this month maybe mother had a paycheck this month I'm and we're twelve cents on her savings ...\nDead why don't we have any other passive income I listen to this crazy do once in the radio and many other people why is that we don't have any passive income\nWell son I'm scared I'm stupid I'm lazy\nIt's got to be one of the three easier too scared to try you're too stupid to figure it out even with all the education that's out there or you're too lazy to even get up and dry\nIt's gotta be one of three so tell your kids sit down tonight at the dinner table and tell your kids kids I'm either too stupid too lazy\nOr to de do stupid too lazy what was the other ones that are not going to get this thing done period that's all there is to I'm not going to do it for us\nI'm going to let you guys grow up and be just like me work for the rest of your life from age twenty four to age Seventy eight eighty years old now\n\nI'm not going to help you I'm not going to teach you how to make money I'm not going to\nBuild the families well do you think about generation after generation what are the things I wanted to bring up with something you don't even see that's mortgage reduction that's another way we make money\nI remember getting excited about it that when I had a lot of property so I don't remember exactly how many properties ahead but I was looking at a situation where I was making a hundred thousand dollars a year and mortgage reduction in five hundred dollars a year and mortgage reduction at the peak when I was a lot of problems I think maybe had like a hundred or a a\nI'm Sorry a million dollars with a mortgage production principle direction and you don't see that million bucks or that five hundred thousand or even that ten or twenty whatever you're earning whatever you're paying down you don't see it but it's there\nTo get out your balance sheet each month ago while the mortgages down the value is up by equity is up\nDo you look at do you have financial statements do you have a balance sheet do you ever resume do you have a list of all of your investments you look at I look at them three or four times a month\nAs different payments come in each time a payment come into that go back to my calculation I keep track of how much I'm earning on all my passive income investments to the to the penny each month I compare them I compete them I tried to make them better every month\nI keep track of all of my earned income that I ... I tried to make that better\nAll of my business income I tried to track all my I Do track all my business and gum and then I put them all together in one giant spreadsheet where I have all of my businesses all of my or didn't start with earned income than business income that interest in income than a rental income\nAdam altogether\nAnd that's my total income for the month slash total income for the if you're not tracking your results like that every month not paying attention then you're not doing your family services\n[noise] think about what I said don't be widely genuine we'll be back tomorrow and the number always seen nothing\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nYour mom's radio show\nDogs have dreamed will join us enough to go on the dot com boom was your radio she'll she'll enjoy their job [noise]\nAre\nStrange is so strange\nI don't know many of you have lived long enough to know that ...\nDecades many you know way back in that other century [laughter] [noise] it wasn't like this I mean it wasn't you know you hear stories about you know people will say well when when I was growing up in our neighborhood you could leave the doors unlocked\nWell you know sometimes I Wonder if that's really true but in many it was true\n\nIt was true I remember my mom and dad during the summertime I left the front door open they locked the screen door but the doors were open during the night\n\nAnd so we're the windows but the screens on anybody could have gotten there nobody was never dawned on that whatever nobody would ever do that\n\nNow you wonder if you can even walk down the street [laughter] [laughter] I don't know where have freak where we've gotten ourselves to it's it's so strange and it's ... right happening right before our eyes are strange I must say\nI'm an observer you know I'm trained to what I've been trained to do but if you look at it and you say my God these strange data [laughter]\nMm Mm Mm Mm I don't know I'm not sure\nThey'll catch this individual or individuals group individual or group domestic or foreign whatever\n...\nThis is a this is a great stress or it will have an effect on people you say wow on a ... can you imagine what what have you lived in New York right now Manhattan or one yeah ...\nWhat if you live next to still come exactly which is down the road from us and we're in\nFive minutes five minutes we can we couldn't we couldn't walk to it mhm\nTech us a while but we get there it's what how many miles three four miles by ... for four or five ...\n...

[noise] downloading [noise]\nNow we know rents are going to go up right a new home could be in your future\nBut you've got the call and apply if there are problems you can discuss ways to improve your credit and then you can buy later\nRobert I've got some feedback I've been getting out there about the show and the social signed on our show there are so many people let's say the information they get from here is literally saved them real money and kept them from getting into jams\nAnd with the knowledge of credit and finance they suddenly feel like they're in charge when it comes to their money\nYou know rabbit my goal with this show and we've really talked about this law you know what what was the goal and and I will tell you the goal has\nChanged you know I mean in the beginning I I really just wanted to come out here and I guess expose\nEverything that was wrong with our industry mhm and and now it's really more about empowering consumers and I really want to give people a framework and give people\nYou know a good set of rules and guidelines that they can use to be smarter consumers and they can make sure they always shop around and to not be afraid of credit you know I think that's one of the that's one of the I guess the the kind of missing messages is as I've\nAs I've exposed the secrets lot of people say well my God this is so terrible I should just stay I should just stay away from credit I should be afraid of credit ... and ... and that that's not it and so yeah I can tell us a story personally of I personally was a lot of credit you know I I use it when I say use I mean you like I use them\nYou know it it's not it's not because I Need the credits because I Want to take advantage of the credit you know I Want to take advantage of the bank because a lot of things you can you can do and so to give you an example you know I I got married last November ... and I got engaged a year ago\nOr in may and and so when I bought my wife's engagement ring I financed it because they offered me twelve months no interest\nRight and wrong with that and so you know an engagement ring as a decent little purchased so what what are they say ... it's just it's been like two months of your salary on the gays or have you believe it's two months to a three month or two to three months of your salary\nAlright so we'll we'll say so the average person out there you know making sixty Seventy thousand dollars a year is is putting Fifteen and twenty thousand dollars into an engagement ring yeah I mean that's\nSo if you take so so if you take that Fifteen or twenty thousand and let's say you're afraid of credit you know there's people say you know what I'm just not going to have any credit I'm not going to borrow maybe have bad Credit Suisse force you down that path\nBut uh let's say you're going to buy a a twenty thousand dollar engagement ring three months of your salary and you make you know right at Seventy thousand dollars a year or whatever like as an example so you take that twenty thousand dollars\nAnd if the the jewelry companies willing to give you twelve months of no interest\nRight well that means that twenty thousand dollars is free to you for the next twelve months mhm right so what I Want people to to think about is so person a walks into jewelry store\nAnd they take twenty thousand dollars out of their savings account\nAnd they buy their in cash and they walk out and they're done gang\nPerson be walks and takes advantage of the twin is what I did takes advantage of the the credit from the store with twelve months to no interest mhm and then they take that twenty thousand dollars for a savings account Rob and they invested in the stock market right and I must say crazy I'm not saying pick stocks like just put into it and I saw a mutual fund\nAnd their return you would have seen is going to be around three to four thousand dollars over the last twelve months and and so then at the end it's time we got to pay off our our thing so we we sell those twenty thousand dollars with stocks and now the twelve months adventurous freeze up so we want to pay this thing on ... but there was an opportunity to make money there\nAnd if you're afraid of credit you know if if you take up a monitor in life that you're never going to use credit you can't take advantage of those types of opportunities here was an opportunity to make\nTwo or three thousand dollars maybe four thousand hours depending on which stops you invested in which we will find you pick the market did really grave last twelve months or do I mean it did you know it was there was a great time\nAnd so having that twenty thousand dollars for an engagement ring interest free meant that twenty thousand with our freedom to do something else but to take advantage of these types of situations you've got to have good credit\nYou've got to understand credit you've got to know how the system works and this is what I Want to empower people to do this is what I Want to teach our listeners how to do so they can identify these types of opportunities\nIdentify the opportunities where credit is a good idea\nNot not be afraid of it you know uh most of our findings bills I put on my American Express\nAnd I mean we obviously spend a lot more than the average person would because all of our a lot of our advertising a lot of our bills go on American Express but I mean any small business owner you one of their life\nYou can build up pretty quick points you know and those points turn into a nice vacation at the end of the er do so just by by you know cruises around here big cruise or I Do ... and and and you can definitely you can get a couple of free cruises a year by using credit correctly us right you know get the points pay this thing off and so that's really what I'm here to do\nI Want to teach people how to utilize libraries and utilize credit because a lot of ways credit is what built this country\nYou know if you look at why we grew as fast as we did and you look at some other countries and how they do not grow as quickly as a lot of it has to do with the credit mentality and while the financial services industries have taken advantage of this and they've turned into a bad thing and they're so bent on taking advantage of people if we as consumers are educated enough\nAnd strong enough and dedicated enough and committed enough to a plan to use credit correctly we can really take advantage of the system and we can pick up a lot of nice perks and a lot of opportunities to make money a lot of opportunities to save money while using credit to our benefit\nInstead of letting the big credit companies use credit to their benefit at our expense\nOn the minimum side obviously the the best thing is to put twenty percent down so that you can eliminate the mortgage insurance that would be a thirty thousand dollar down payment and again that's a question here coming out of Jacksonville\nA couple of things to follow up on first when you heard Robert refer to a VA long if you're a veteran that's where you you need to check it out a lot of advantages there now it's a zero down type of loan very attractive rates and it's just for our beds now\nAnother loan product that his erode down is the USDA ... in the U. S. T. A. loan is available in many rural areas around the country one thing is urban sprawl is getting out there\nAnd yet ... property is still rated USDA\nAlright let's get back to the phones Tom is on the line and Tom as I understand that you're already in order to be funding plant\nRobert it's working for me I'm a little bit with which we were greatly appreciate I just had a quick question had mentioned during this process\nWe're not supposed to make any kind of changes gorgeous and we're going through this I'm but I'm In I'm\nIn the middle of having to ensure my\nPrice for the insurance now is almost double what it was last year and um I can get it through a different companies for almost ... price that one of those things you're talking about this you're not supposed to screw it you know in the interim\nNighttime here first let me let me applaud you for asking you know I I think that is that the key here you know in that that is simply what we want you to do you know as a customer during this mortgage process I mean we can't give you that that in all list of of what you can and can't do and what we really we just want to do is call us and asking in your case\nAt changing the insurance on your boat is not going to affect the mortgage process\nUm you know we do not count that in your debt to income ratio that's not one of the qualifying things we have to count against you because it's not a debt\nOr you're the debt on the boat we would have to count those types of things but the insurance we do not so you are good to go ahead and take care of that insurance policy but again and to anyone listening no matter what mortgage company you're working with if you were in the process of buying a home or refinancing and you are making any changes to your finances as Tom just said\nA simple phone call to the mortgage company to ask the question will save you a lot of heartache because if you are changing one of the things you know a time if you would call to say hey I'm I'm refinancing my boat to a shorter term in the payments gonna triple you know that's a different story so the boat insurance is not a big deal you know I'm Glad I could step to step in and help you guys out you know unfortunately\nYou know we started this process with Tom the appraisal came in shorter than what we expected or\nYou know there's nothing we can do really to to change the appraisal I did talk to a couple appraisers to get their opinion we did some review appraisals and and then they came back accurate so in the end\nTo help Tom out we we altered our guidelines to do a higher loan to value so we could still make the the refinance work and it's still you know deliver on their property initially discussed yeah appraisals are a big point of contention right now it it's a hard spot for all lenders and\nWe really just try to do what we can to accommodate when we can win an appraisal comes in low because it can be very frustrating so yeah I'm Glad you're stuck in there with us Tom and I think we're getting pretty close to the finish line with you but uh you're good to go I Would change that insurance over\nAll right very good let's go to a friend in Polk County Florida what's your question\nI got a bankruptcy\nAnd a plan to watch it because I didn't have a job and now that I got a job I'm trying to ... how would I say\nHey that's interesting question fat I you know not being an attorney I'm not really familiar there's some very particular laws and rules when it comes to a bankruptcy and I'm not sure exactly from the bankruptcy court side you know how that's going to work um I Do know that there are options to reaffirmed the home as a part of a bankruptcy I'm not sure legally when you have to do that\nUm you know I think your best bet would be to reach back out to the attorney who filed for bankruptcy let them know what the situation is let them know what the circumstances are and let them know what you're trying to accomplish\nAnd they should be able to guide you know based on how your bankruptcy was filed a what the best course of action is to make sure you can keep your home and begin making payments again and now there's that property\nHave a great weekend actually cough red blue waters your question\nMy question is if let's say you guys you have a lousy credit but all of a sudden you came into a lot of cash then you would like to buy a house strictly casual encounters ... when you encounter\nBecause if you want to buy a house and\nIn fact couple issues you know for the main part as long as you're not borrowing any part of the the purchase price and you're paying a hundred percent cashier credit you shouldn't come in too much play a couple of things to watch out for is if if you've ever had judge judgment and filed against you you know as a part of having a bad credit if there's ever been a creditor\nWho was able to sue you and have a judgment placed on you that judgment can attached to their property automatically\nUm other than that you may have some issues getting insurance you may pay slightly higher insurance rates but when you're paying all cash there's really no nothing anybody can do to stop you from buying a house regardless of how bad your credit is so that that shouldn't create any issues for you know have you been told their issues are you just said you know trying to be proactive and find out before you get in the process\nI haven't bought a house yet okay but I just want to find out what problems I wouldn't count her case I bought a house and a friendly guy\nYeah you wouldn't have any issues at all you know as a cash by her no one has the rights even ready to look at your credit the only people like I said that might be the uh the insurance company might take a look at your credit and bad credit may affect your homeowner's insurance rates\nBut again when you pay all cash it's even your option whether you want to have insurance or not I would personally recommended in case a disaster strikes but that's your call when you pay cash because there are no mortgage company involved to pull your creditor to dictate the rules to you so you know feel feel comfortable to go out there with your cash and buy whatever home you'd like\nAgain you'll find similar questions on credit and articles by visiting saving thousands Doug gum and there's a feature on that site this up these would weekly called money minute\nBesides this radio show Robert appears on top radio stations across the country every morning during drive time with them money manage the money minutes or yours to play back on demand it's saving thousands dodge\nAll right Robert let's stay on credit ... there's a lot of the creditors out there that are offering their version of our credit score and credit standing but you\nAnd I are in our audience knows that is the white go score the right if someone is giving you a psycho score it's the real one they can't make up a fake psycho score right what they have to do is when it's not the psycho score they have to call it something else they have to give it some other name so the key is when you're ...\nI can your credit score and make sure you're getting the psycho score and really what that means is that the scoring model\nThat was developed by their eyes at corporation the original company they've not changed their name to fight go because I Do yes they they changed the psycho because that's what everybody knew him as like a ... corporation psycho so they're not just called psycho\nAnd they changed their name but they invented this they built of her scoring model there the model that we as lenders trust and what this model does that looks at it looks at late payments it looks at on time payments it looked at how old your credit is how new your credit is yeah I watch how old is your oldest to count how new is your newest to count\nHow many late payments to have you had how recent or those low late payments right late payment last month\nIs a red flag late payments six years ago not so much and rain you know do you have any collections do you have any charge off you know what's going on and your credit file that they need to be concerned about and they built this model it looks at your balances\nThe percentage you owe on your credit cards compared to your limits so let's say the limit is ten thousand dollars and you oh ten thousand one hundred year over limit on a credit card that's a big negative factor\nIf you owe one hundred dollars on my credit card in the balance of ten thousand that's a positive factor because what it says is\nIt says hey he has the ability to go charge ten thousand dollars and he's not doing it right you know someone with maxed out credit cards who's heavily using their credit is a bigger risk than someone who has all these available credit cards and doesn't use them because they have sufficient money in the bank and they have savings and they're they're more conscious with how they spend money\nAll those things are reflected in fair Isaac psycho built the model that looks ... are you shopping for a new credit\nIf all of a sudden if you know so right now Rob let's say I pay my bills on time or if tomorrow I go out and buy a Lamborghini three boats six houses an airplane will I be able to make my payments anymore probably not I'd write will bankrupt\nAnd so that's what they look at when you're opening new accounts when you're opening new debts it's all about tracking how you can build a handle this and so when you do open new accounts they kind of put you in the doghouse for the next six months because they want to make sure you're going to be able to handle the new liability you went from this set of bills and now you added some new bills\nAnd so you have new payments to make let's see if you can absorb them do you make enough money and this is why they don't even care about your your income anymore because what what fair Isaac and fight those figured out if you're paying off your bills on time and you're not mixing out your credit cards then you have plenty of income\nIf your credit cards are all maxed out and you're struggling to pay your bills then you probably don't have enough income\nRight and if you're responsible if you've been responsible for the last five years why age of credit is important Rob\nSo if you if you've been responsible your credit for the last five years right so every time you get a new account you paid on time and you never miss a lick and you're not for five years or seven years or ten years or Fifteen Years\nYou know and if you're looking for a mortgage odd or student loans it may cause multiple industry crashed your credit report even looking for one loan to compensate for this\nPsycho scores ignore and mortgage I was doing an increase made in the early days prior to your scoring right this is All right I might go dot com so it's actually under two sections ones on her does the formula treat all credit increase the same it's also under what to know about rape shopping\nOr they've also got some great tips on here about how to improve improve your psycho scores and all that is on my psycho dot com under credit checks and increased so\nYou know again you don't have to take my word for word it's right there in in any company who tells you not to shop around not no don't talk to any of my competitors are going to talk to your credit score shared his buddy you run just know what that's all about\nYou know and I will I Will promise you know one here will ever tell you that if they do offer fire on the spy if I ever hear that one of my loan officers told somebody not to have their credit pulled by a competitor because it would drop their score because the big load of malarkey\nSo another urban myth disproven when you're shopping for a mortgage to buy something crossing a hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more every the interest rate fluctuation and all that will cost you majored Tyler's\nAgain use saving thousands rule number one always shop around especially when it comes to a mortgage but it'll work for you is almost every purchase your copy of the Fifteen saving thousands rules to success can be found is saving thousands dot com\nOn the Web we have time for one more question from the audience Robert getting into our final segment of the show court wants to know the financial formula he would use to see you getting a reply is a good idea today\nSo Robert yeah round the most important thing people have to understand is is when is it beneficial to refinance right there's all these urban legends and myth and old wives' tales and my personal favorite is this is one that was perpetrated by the big banks\nAnd they tell people you shouldn't refinance your mortgage unless you can save two percent yeah okay I Know first off I Want to put this in perspective and when they when this came about interest rates were like Seventeen or Eighteen percent so yeah\nIf the race that high you've got to save two percent to make a difference because rates are so high you know that's cutting your interest by about ten percent of what it is yeah well now the rates are so low\nIf you're eight six six cutting it by ten percent will be going down to five point for\nRight so the same proportion of drop is just not there the other thing is the banks they don't want you to refinance\nYou know if you're paying them six percent today huh why would they want you to pay four percent right does that how they make their money doesn't make any sense so so many people get hung up on this idea of well I have to save ... percent or it's not worth it to refinance I said that's not the case at all so I Want to walk people through today is\nHow to do the calculation\nI could it's different for everybody that actually different for everybody how to do the calculation of how much you're going to save for the first thing you need to figure out is what are the upfront costs of the mortgage loan right okay so that's the first thing we have to know it there's there's three things that go into this equation the upfront costs on a mortgage loan\nThe monthly savings from the refinance and the amount of time you're going to be in that home ... the number one is to get those upfront costs now someone who is out there they charge crazy amount a lender fees you could end up paying for five six seven thousand dollars on the cost to refinance\nWhatever that that cost it will be given to you by your lender on what's called a good faith estimate or some companies use a form called an initial the worksheet\nEither way you need to how much those closing costs are in the state of Florida\nWe have intangible tax we have ducks dams we have a title insurance all of these costs play in and then you add in any lender fees the lenders charging and easily upfront costs now what is not a cost but we also we lift it on the sheet is the amount of money needed to establish your escrow account\nSo what happens is Rob when you have an escrow account the lender is going to pay your taxes and insurance for you annually so they have to have enough money in the account to pay that so if you refinance your mortgage your mortgage in March and your first payment is due in may and your taxes are due in November you're going to make I may payment\nAs human payment uh July payment\nAnd August payment a September ... and October payment and then boom the taxes are due in November right you're only getting made six payments but they've got to pay twelve months worth of tests\nIs that what happens is they have to get the difference from you up right yeah All right so that just ... account and this is not a cost because of what happens is your old Linder has to send you a check\nFor any money left in your old escrow account so this is a Washington so when you're determining the cost of the mortgage loan\nYou take the good faith aspirin or the ease worksheet and you did duck the amount of money being collected for homeowners insurance escrow and packed escrow and this is going to leave you with the cost of the loan than you I write that number down\nTo two thousand three thousand four thousand five thousand maybe zero whatever that number is you need to write that down\nThe next thing you look at is what is your monthly savings okay and this can be a little tough to it's not just up payment savings and if you have twenty eight years left on your mortgage and you refinance to a thirty year fixed you're going back two years\nSo the payments can actually be a little lower because you've added two years onto the tail end of the mortgage which you have to actually look at it how much interest argue saving\nEvery payment ... may not the total payment savings because it's all a payment savings if you go from a twenty year to attend a Fifteen year the payments can actually go up but you're still saving money in\n... so you need to know what that interest savings is the way you do that day you take your loan amounts right and you multiply it by your old interest rate so a hundred thousand are alone if I was at six percent I was going to pay six thousand dollars in interest that year if I take a hundred thousand our loan times four percent\nI'm going to pay four thousand dollars in interest right that the different ... so you calculate the difference between that who's that differences two thousand dollars if I die by twelve and that's your monthly fame or just look at it as a yearly number I'm going to save two thousand dollars the first year\nIt costs me four thousand dollars in upfront cost\nTherefore it will take me two years to break even on this refinance loans if I'm going to sell the house and twelve months bad deal\nIf I'm going to sell the house and twenty four months I break even but who wants to get a mortgage just to break even bad deal if I'm going to be in that house for four five six seven eight years now I can really save some money so you have to look at those two numbers compared to each other you take the upfront costs compared to the yearly savings\nSee how many years it's going to take you to make up the difference to start saving money and then think about how many years you're going to be in the house because there are some people out there if if they're getting a loan with no costs\nAnd they're dropping the rate just say point two five percent\nThat's still point two five percent and pure ... if you go from a four and a quarter to a four percent rate with no cost two hundred thousand are alone that's roughly five hundred dollars a year in savings if you're going to be in your house for ten years\nYou can save a lot of money that way so don't don't think of any rule of thumb there is no old wives' tale though it's got to be ... percent of a drop it's gotta be something that makes sense for your financial situation and if you're going to leave that house in the next twelve months there is no number that makes financial sense if you're only a couple of years away from paying that mortgage off\nThere is no number they make financial sense right but if you're going to be in that house for the next Thirty years\nAnd there's not very much in upfront costs it doesn't take hardly anything at all to make it makes sense it's a purely financial decision to make it upfront costs divided by yearly savings equals years to recoup the cost and then years just start saving that's all you've got to look at\nThey you Robert bomber that brings us to the end of the show but there's more empowering information at the website I mentioned saving thousands dot com\nAnd you can always

Powerball but he's still wondering what if I did and there's nothing wrong with dreaming as one expert says as we shift our thoughts away from what's wrong in our lives to the possibilities of something better we attract good things for ourselves\nVisionary coach Laurie Dixon is here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins Laurie what do you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility and so what it does it allows us to start to dream and drain in a big way\nWell you know the the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch really\nFar so that's part of the process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun\nStart to look at our lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream and we wonder and we think if I go by that took it won't do that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance integrate or way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's\nHowever\nI see a new door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nSure and so you think about turnout not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers are yours and you have to go back to work that day what you want to do is say okay well I Can't I have\nX Y Z and you felt that blank can why can't I Dream about a bigger house is that something that's gonna blessed my family is that something that I'm going to have the ability to do more in my life with\nAnd so it's about being able to put into that it stretches and it sets and tension really different\nIs there's such a thing as too much dreaming or dreaming too big or to water I don't know why\nShould I mean if we dream did that then we don't follow it up with any yeah then I mean that creates us to go into things like anxiety or even to be depressed a little bit because we think we're never going to reach that so we self again we self doubt we self sabotage\n... speaking with Laurie Dixon visionary coach based in Dallas texas returning about how you can turn your big lotto dreams into improving your life or a somewhat of a reality I'm so explain to the visualization process what do you do say the day after you didn't win you know a billion dollars in the jackpot\nWell I talk a lot about being in the comfort zone and in the status quo of life and so if you didn't know when you have to at least recognize where am I stuck what's keeping me and that comfort zone of life\nWhat can I Do differently today and take one step up and one step out to set an intention towards something new so what is that new dream or that new opportunity like we're suggesting\nSo it's one step at a time\nI saw a bullet point in your notes here what I thought was interesting uh what do you say is the fastest\nWay to destroying your dreams\nNot believing in yourself and if you notice I said not sabotaged by others but self sabotage because we believe the lies and then we allow the fear and why do we do so yeah why why how how do we stop or why do we do both you\nKnow how we stop doing a start to really realize who we are and valuing those aspects that are subtle and so it's being able to be reflected a little bit which not a lot of people enjoy\nBasically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read to see if they're going to be more creative you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was the rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it with a rake and then\nThe guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but\nI've heard of people being stimulated buried alive waterboarded forced to eat some pretty crazy things they've had to light other actors on fire\nThere's just some very interesting things that happen here and it seems like each one that happens it's just next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times go one recently the event included with him stripped his boxers and curled into fetal position to take the mud straw unseemly to body fluids his first words afterwards that was awesome\n[laughter] exactly so that was the one that I was that and\nYou know it was interesting because that took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an existential space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV they were stripped of their clothes and put in this distress base here\nAnd they were told that they were these criminals that had been the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this this embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking them through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and they ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this thought and this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and strict rationing them around and rich the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear\nAnd is just nearing simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest than yes so the majority of these protests are going to that end up in the fetal position in their underwear and what was the ... about it as that you know I'm watching this thinking\nWow that they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would do it again they're telling me that these memories are going to last them a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some ... of these extreme haunts\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys\nWas kind of funny and he told me that his only rules were basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred than that but you know they actually get physical which is funny I mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having no touching rural\nAnd these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they\nLeave with circus scratches but they all said that they kind of expected that going in and you know they all wanted to make it known that they're not into just being tortured for the sake of being torture but the beauty is that they're basically living their own horror films and as long as it moves to
