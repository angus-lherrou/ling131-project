nine ...\nDot com\nThe fool or ... or ... program\nOf the inside retirement powered by retirement planning ... dot com\nI'm Paul ... and I'm here with my brother Kurt Cassidy and we have a really amazing show today we're going to talk about a subject that I think\nEverybody worries about and really doesn't know how to address and those are\nThe investment traps that you face before and during retirement and there are a lot of them and we're going to try to tackle this subject is always in a short period of time but when we think Kirk about some of the biggest traps that people face as they enter into retirement or in the in retirement when they invest\nIn the market you know and the the first thing that comes to my mind that we hear all the time\nIs just not planning right people just actually don't plan for retirement\nAnd that's probably the single biggest trap when you're investing in the market ... would you agree well it is a particularly for those people within ten years or retirement or in retirement in ... there is an amazing statistic ... honestly before we jump in part I I Want to say this is going to be a\nAn hour show and I hope you all stick with us throughout the show 'cause we are going to talk about a lot of very important topics or many of which\nAre not conventional by our industry standards right so the first one bringing it back home to your original point Paul is the lack of planning that's being done for people preparing to and through retirement the statistic shows that only four percent of retirees actually have a written plan\nWhich is just mind boggling blows your mind every time we talk about it it's something we mentioned in our class and I think people\nDon't believe that don't believe in part because they don't really know what you mean by a retirement plan issue right it's that you know your statements the probability of whether you will outlive your money or not like a Monte Carlo simulation or or running models at four percent withdrawal rates that's not a plan right and we're we'll talk about what a plan is but\nBut it begins by making sure you're mapping out when to take income from which account at what age so to mitigate the risk of outliving your money because there's something called sequence of return risk which we spend a lot of time talking about in their classes\nAnd then also taxes taxes is the single greatest a risk an opportunity for retirees that most people are not addressing planning for our industry doesn't ... eh well everyone mentions it but no one really does any planning for it\nAnd I can tell you Paul for us we're saving most of our clients between five and Fifteen thousand dollars a year in taxes\nAnd if you add that up throughout your retirement because you've planned and you found the best sequence to take money from the rate of counts the right age\nAnd saved that much taxes your money left that much longer without taking any more risk in the market both people are following the general rules are industry has promoted you know you're within five years a retirement this is what your risk profile should be now you're retired and you're sixty this how much bonds you should have and this is how much stocks you see that\nFolks that's not a plan that is a simplified version of a solution that for the masses that our industry has created promoted and condition due to believe what you should be doing but it's totally irrelevant to your situation\nBack to your point Paul that particular client quite honestly was taking more risk than they needed to take\nBecause they were following the general rules but they have plenty of money right so it's going to take excessive risk and you have plenty of money one of two things are happening either you're greedy and I would suggest most people\nIn retirement don't make the mistake of being greedy it's a lack of understanding what they have how long it will last them and how much risk they need to take and that's how you determine\nThe state of being greedy it's a lack of understanding what they have how long it will last them\nAnd how much risk they need to take and that's how you determine your risk profile not what a general rule is Paul I'm Sorry I Know you want to make a point but I Want to make sure I I catch this I use the analogy think about trying to build a home\nWithout going through an architect to draft your plans or another words buying furniture for your home before you build your home and that's what you all have done you all have investments all these different investments that furniture\nOr that's the wood that you're going to build the home with but you don't know furniture fits in your home you first have to plan build the home then determine what investments should go in the in the plant\nI mean ... ... it's so self evident right I mean the analogy that you give it makes total sense yet I gotta say Ninety ... some percent of the people I meet with don't have plans\nSo if it is so obvious if what we're saying is so obvious that right plan before you do and we knew that and everything our lives plan before you do if it's so obvious why does it not happen then\nOkay so this this is where there's got to be a little bit of trust by our listeners I'm telling you your condition to believe what you should and shouldn't do in retirement\nUm were were on TV regularly right we're in in magazines and newspapers were always interviewed and we're always told you have to give your message in thirty second soundbites\nSo when we're us professionals are out there being interviewed\nOr wanting they they want us to write an article for Forbes are kept lenders\nAre challenges we have a very small window of time to impact the greatest amount of people so therefore we are making very general rules to the masses and unfortunately at least for us most people who attend our courses in university settings and we alternately work with\nThese people are a little bit different than the masses I I Know it's hard for some of these guys the belief but you've a cumulative some resources there's thirty five percent of the people in our in most retirement studies that are only living on Social Security that does not apply to you so these general rules don't apply to you\nSo we're just scratching the surface and I hope you stick with us throughout the hour 'cause we

Ninety One percent\nFrom asset allocation right we don't people to talk about ... well you also have to remember the people that are on those shows talking are controlling\nHundreds of millions if not billions of dollars they're not you they're not the individual investor who is dependent on this money to survive them they don't have the single greatest fear you have which is outliving your money\nTo ... you know you talked about timing and you mentioned there is to\nGet to make two decisions right when you go out and when you go in and and I I I can think of a couple of people that we worked with\nIt's a little easier to pick when you go out I mean it ... the markets and an all time high and and people are panicking and everyone assumes the market's going to go down the people have you met with sudden the last three years\nThree years ago where an all time high we should get out exactly\nExactly right but really when you go back in is even more challenging right so now everyone is afraid we'll get back in the markets Ohio they want to do that so you continue to stay on the sideline right you can't time the market no you can't in if you just are disciplined and here's the challenge\nBecause I Know some of us thinking that are maybe sixty five years old just retired you may be saying yourself well over the last Thirty years the U.S and the five hundred performed at ten percent ... I might not have Thirty years\nNo you're right you're you're a hundred percent right you must acid allocate so you have dollars that are ... that aren't volatile that are somewhat guaranteed\nTo provide income for the next ten years so that we can eliminate sequence of return risk and then we ask that allocate some of those other dollars into account that are more long term and if we just leave it alone and not allow our emotions get in the way are going to perform well over the long run\nIt comes back to proper asset allocation and I'm not talking just sector which sectors to to allocate to but it's ... dollars do we allocate for income what dollars do we allocate for future income ten years from now\n... dollars do we allocate for future income beyond that Twenty years from now what do I ... for legacy it all comes back to a plant Paul\nAnd now a wet dollars do we allocate for future income beyond that Twenty years from now what do I ... for a legacy\nIt all comes back to a plant Paul that's where it all comes back to\nNow I Know we want to talk about fees and fees is the second greatest factor in impacting your performance and as you retire it has a way of compounding on itself as we're taking distributions out and being charged fees\nBut of course in the segment we're going to run out of time so we are going to carry it forward to the next segment we're going to talk about fees and the next segment so again we want to remind everybody\nI'm Paul and I've been teaching classes and you might notice and our radio show we don't talk about our much about our personal practices right I mean we've helped over six hundred people to and through retirement fifty to Ninety seven years old our oldest clients\nManage hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars\nWhen we work with somebody it takes us twenty thirty forty hours to build the plan we are not giving the next ten callers a free road map to retirement that isn't possible to do a custom roadmap for five hundred and twenty people as they get ten new people every week\nWe're teaching the classes so that you can learn how to build your own road map for retirement how to identify the right advisors to help you how do you do background checks\nHow do you know if someone is a fiduciary or a broker so that's what we do in our classes and that's why we teach our classes we teach them every month we teach them at the University of Michigan eastern Michigan University\nIn Michigan State university you know by campus\nThese courses are eight out seven eight hours and link taught in two separate evenings or one full day Saturday\nWe go through a two hundred page tax book this is comprehensive planning we lift the hood of the investment industry everything the good the bad ugly you're going to understand how it all works and how to put it all together for yourself\nWe charge a fee for people to attend this course is twenty nine dollars for you and your spouse or you in a guest go to retirement\nPlanning edu dot com retirement planning edu dot com or you can call one eight hundred to for oh eight nine one one eight hundred to four or eight nine ... won all your questions can be answered on the website\nSavage traffic on the WWE change how the tiny assigned twenty eight checking the ... accents or put it this time weekend construction on six antics Ethan from telling us\nAny side has been cancelled due to weather and six hundred sixty than from declaring Ninety four construction is in that right wing until ten pm Seventy five more than some simply to North lined only the right lane is open until friday and Monday from the idol download a group twenty four hour traffic center I'm Tina Marie WWE genius rainy and then the\nYou teen and your accuweather forecast for the rest of your Sunday Now with meteorologist ...\nToday it will be rather cloudy and cooler with occasional light rain and some drizzle behind just sixty four tonight there'll be a shower or too early otherwise mostly cloudy below fifty seven starting\nMuch warmer tomorrow as clouds break or some sun but they're also will be a shower or a thunderstorm in the afternoon the high around eighty quite warm and humid Tuesday with a mixture of clouds and San ... shower or a thunderstorm high eighty one\nWednesday son will be followed by clouds a couple of showers are expected high Seventy eight much cooler on Thursday\nWith plenty of cloud will be ... to hide fifty nine or ... with a meteorologist herbal didn't ski on W.

W. J. new signed five forty we return now to inside retirement Motor City edition right here on W. W. J. news radio nine fifty\nInside retirement show the power by retirement planning edu dot com\nPaul Mettler I'm here with my brother Kurt Cassidy and we are talking about the investment traps that you will face a as you enter into retirement and while you're in retirement and we've talked a lot of things right but the one thing we haven't talked about is\nThis term called efficiency see we're talking about investments and everybody when you talk about investments everybody talks about the rate of return you get right how much have you earn we meet people and that's the first question they want to ask us what is your average rate of return how are you doing\nYou get right how much have you earn we need people and that's the first question they want to ask us what is your average rate of return how are you doing with your clients writes always the question in our classes for the last couple of years one of the things we always we sort of set people up we asked them\nSo how have you performed how's your investments doing is everyone think you're doing well and right now you better be raising your hand keep your hands on the wheel but [laughter] you should be raised my hand you're doing well right now right\nAnd so then I challenged them with this question are you doing well are are you lucky how do you know you're doing well so our industry has conditions you measure success by performance but the but the reality is Paul's right there's two ... two performance\nAnd to ask us what our average rate of return is just unfair it's set up in a really isn't shouldn't be the primary focus as you get into retirement because your goals and objectives are going to be different so each individual person\nIs going to be trying to drive a different rate of return depending on the amount of risk they can afford to take are willing to take\nSo one of the ways I explain it is because if we looked at the last five years of your investments take the last five years and\nWe did a stress test of that we wouldn't be able to tell you in the last five years from Pete the valley the greatest draw down the greatest lost your portfolio experienced over the last five years I can tell you the point of time it occurred and how much you would have lost\nAnd I can also do that with the S. and P. five hundred the benchmark I can look at the U.S and the five hundred and seeing the last five years\nHow much is the greatest loss from Pete the valley did they lose so once we have those two numbers of the ... the greatest loss in the last five years from your portfolio and the U.S and the five hundred I can determine how much risk you are taking compared to the U.S and the five hundred\nSo let's make up a number let's say you were taking eighty percent of the risk of the S. and P. five hundred will if you're taking eighty percent of the risk you should be getting eighty percent of the return correct\nAnd if you were getting eighty percent of that return you would be one hundred percent efficient okay if you are getting more return for that amount of risk than we would say you have a positive alpha okay\nThe problem is most of you I hate to tell you because the fees because of mutual funds because of emotions you're going to find over the last five years that you have much greater risk that you've taken compared to the best mark versus the return so you may be taking eighty percent of the risk\nIn only getting forty percent of the return\nAnd if you think about that that's not good that's lucky you've been lucky that the market happens to be up and you return your forty percent\nBut if the market would have been down you would have lost eighty percent and that would be devastating in retirement so if you're looking at your statement\nAnd you're seeing that you've average six seven percent every year and you're all excited thinking man I've done really well right that's really not what you should be asking which be asking is how much risk did you take\nTo earn that six or seven percent because when the market starts going down you're actually going to really care how much risk you took to get that six or seven percent no question and it's it's the measurement we use to measure ourselves and others and it's the one you should you should measure there's two things we talked about in our class that everyone should understand\nFirst of all if we had a two thousand eight event how much would you lose you should know that number\nIn the last five years what was the match draw down your portfolios experience and the ... in the last five years you should know that number and that's how you should determine how much risk you're comfortable taking not that you're a moderate investor moderate conserve it\nNo that number and that's how you should determine how much risk you're comfortable taking not that you're a moderate investor or moderate conservative or conservative that is a subjective number for you folks\nYou want to know the number and you need to determine what is my number than I Am comfortable with losing and once you determine what that number is if it's Fifteen if it's twenty percent now we can establish a baseline of how much risk you're taking and now we can measure our we efficient or we inefficient\nSo so as we talk about risk Kirk\nI'm I'm thinking of of another trap and and I always want to get more into the segments that I Know we should fire I I think we should talk about bonds right because we ... you know the whole show on vibrate our sure but I'm thinking of bonds\nAnd I think there's a trap around bonds right in and you're talking about risk people assume go to buy and you don't have to make do have to worry about any of this so I have a minute and a half to explain to someone to go do so in a rising interest rate environment bonds are very dangerous there's a time and place to drive yield and make money and bonds\nMost experts would argue this is not the time or place to do it we need to wait until interest rates rise and then take that opportunity again\nThe problem is most of you in your moral one case don't have any individual bonds you can buy you're stuck in bond funds bond funds have historically very poorly performed in that same del bar study I've been quoting over the last Thirty years bond funds have averaged under one percent\nIf you just bought and the the Barclay index bond index you would have performed almost six percent\nShe'll bond funds have historically been horrible and right now they're incredibly expensive because they are scrambling meaning they're buying and selling buying and selling inside that mutual fund constantly driving tremendous fees we're seeing three four percent in those bond funds now with turnover ratios\nThey're expensive they're not going to perform well and you want to be really really cautious\nAnd that's how ... you know your target date funds that's where most people are going right now because that's what they've been told and this is a dangerous approach right so so I think the takeaway Kirk is as we're talking about trapped in this that guy in a minute you did it amazing job right as we are talking about traps one trap is if you're buying a bunch of bond funds thinking you're doing this to minimize your risk\nAs you are entering the retirement or retirement\nThink again there's a lot of risk especially in this low interest rate environment to these bond funds as well as a lot of the all the average bond fund and the first quarter of this year last four percent\nSo that is not a state not place right so so let's talk about a class yes So Paul and I teach classes regularly held at the University of Michigan eastern Michigan University in Michigan State university the nobody campus\nThis
