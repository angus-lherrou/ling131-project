becomes easier once you have them then you can get to cooking\nAnd when we talk about a fermenting we're not just talking about pickles\nIs not just pickles as some people have to say oh that's about bread or it's about brewing beer no I mean for patients they are also stuff like soy sauce for instance or measles they also a product of imitation and so we've innovated on that in the ...\nIn the beginning of the ... that's what's fun and so we try to have as much of that going on as possible but I wouldn't eat a lot of space I mean that's the most costly and time consuming thing is to do this this stuff between the beginning of the idea in the end\nAnd we have multiple things at the same time so we have a quite a large property people say this is huge you can have a hotel here um and we see forty guest a feeding 'em yet we have like sixteen hundred square meters which I think is like sixteen Seventeen thousand square feet at\nA restaurant and most of it is because we're fiddling around and testing things and trying to progress and move on and we're not done with this at all I mean we uh we I have more ideas on how to expand on this still\nExpand on on what on the research on how to push cooking forward\nWell how to keep developing exactly the the cooking of a region the the ideas and some of the\nYou know profound genres within cooking which fermentation actually is I mean it is a genre of its own that deserves a lot of attention I Believe it's the future but it's it's a way of making\nFood delicious and and ah and doing it a little easier than before I mean we started doing this because about five years ago we realized we have to shut the door to the place to start looking for a new place and we stumbled upon this one\nAnd as we found it real ... and what can we do here was this huge property like a three acres of land right instead of town you quickly realized okay what has driven out so far is is mostly things from the plant kingdom\nSo we thought why don't we just became a vegetarian restaurant that's that you know that we should be set it like that let's become a vegetarian restaurant\nAnd also it's there's something about it that alludes to the future it feels like that's where things are going anyway and I enjoy it a lot I eat predominant vegetarian myself but at the time I was thinking okay how are we going to do that I mean how would

I knew him for forty warm the head chef and co owner of no ma ... talks with CBS News producer Aaron ... about a new book or a cookbook on fermentation\nIs sort of ABC on how to do fermentation in your home and fermentation is all about creating building blocks for your kitchen at home so cooking becomes easier once you have them then you can get to cooking\nAnd when we talk about ah fermenting we're not just talking about pickles\nIs not just pickles or some people as to say oh that's about Brett or it's about brewing beer no I mean for patients\nThey are also stuff like soy sauce for instance or measles they also a product of imitation and so we have innovated on that in the past Fifteen Years and we believe it's the DNA of of what makes no money no ma\nGetting to to the end goal is something in between the beginning of the ... that's what's fun and so we try to have as much of that going on as possible that but that we need a lot of space I mean that's the most costly and time consuming thing is to do this this stuff between the the beginning of the idea in the end\nAnd we have multiple things at the same time so we have a quite a large property people say this is huge you could have a hotel here um and we see forty guest a feeding 'em yet we have like sixteen hundred square meters which I think is like sixteen Seventeen thousand square feet of restaurants and most

forward\nWell how to keep developing exactly the the cooking of a region the the ideas and some of the\nYou know profound uh genres within cooking which fermentation actually is I mean it is a genre of its own that deserves a a lot of attention I Believe it's the future uh it's it's a way of making\nFood delicious and and ah and doing it a little easier than before I mean we started doing this because about five years ago we realized we have to shut the door to the old place to start looking for a new place and we stumbled upon this one\nAnd as we founded we'll start thinking what can we do here but it was a huge property like a three acres of land right instead of town we quickly realized okay what has driven out so far is is mostly things from the plant kingdom\nSo we thought why don't we just became a vegetarian restaurant that's that you know that we simply just said it like that let's become a vegetarian restaurant\nAnd also it's there's something about it that alludes to the future it feels like that's where things are going anyway and I enjoy it a lot I eat predominant vegetarian myself but at the time I was thinking okay how are we going to do that I mean how would we make a bullet spinach as delicious as steak\nAnd so that's when that's when this imitation really got put into a a grid system and organized and hired ... right people research people scientists
