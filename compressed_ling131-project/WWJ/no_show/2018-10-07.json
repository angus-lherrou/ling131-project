Court\n... professor of political science at eastern Michigan University joining us live this evening on the other end of our newsmakers live lined up first stuff good evening professor I thanks for doing this with us\nShirt chasing good evening to you\nKnow a hearty majority now what's your take on the new profile of the highest court in the land\nWell I ... if we take a personalities recent traumatic events uh and find a way to hold them aside for the moment\nAh this particular president was going to put a conservative justice on the court and that's just what he did and and so the court will move to the right I don't think anybody's is terribly surprised by that surprised comes in the sort of rancor is\nA set of hearings and and and I'm a sort of incivility that we watch for the last couple of weeks but but in terms of\nOf where the court is it is a more conservative court today a or Tuesday when they said I should say a than it was last week or the week before\nA short term here a potentially a strengthening that blue wave that everybody keeps talking about come November\nJason that is a great question um it it seems you know some are saying that women\nWho are so outraged by what they've seen a wheel in fact um show tremendous turnout drag more people to the polls and create the wave that you're asking about however there are some of the things that enough\nOf the Republican base was galvanized\n'em by what they perceived as as nasty treatment of Mr Cavanaugh a and the Republicans are hoping Mitch McConnell said as much today um that that more Republicans will turn out and there won't be a blue wave\nA my suspicion is still that that the Democrats have a real good shot at taking house um and and it's going to be a very a dynamic and traumatic um mid term election\nUh Kavanaugh has become somewhat of a household name over the last two weeks more so than other justices that are confirmed and I'd go on to serve on the U.S Supreme Court\nOr outside of the Supreme Court rulings you don't often hear of singled out justices through your expertise how long is Kavanaugh in say the hot water here\nOh ... you know ... some believe and and I'm not sure but but I understand\nHow long is Kavanaugh in save the hot water here\nOh ... you know ... some believe and and I'm not sure but but I understand why many would suggest that this is a fellow who's going to have an asterisk next to his name for very long time it was the smallest\nA confirmation majority since the Garfield administration the early Eighteen eighties um and it was as I said earlier ugly and dramatic and and\nAnd frankly hardest and then I think that's what's going to uh come up and historical analyses half a century from now um and and any hearings that that uh a Kevin up participates in now can you can go beyond the partisanship that he showed so obviously\nA during his confirmation hearings and and the committee hearings last week into\nHis behavior and and be a bit more of a temper a judge and that's that's something we'll have to tell in time\nNow we are hit on the short term long term how does this confirmation impact the legacy of President Trump\nGreat question um I you know Mr Trump will will be remembered for more things for you and I have have time to talk about but he has been able with Mitch McConnell's help to load ... adult three levels\nUh with very conservative challenges and that's one of the things that he campaigned um and and I think it's safe to say that what what this\nConfirmation does ah is effect social policy is will see it for the next several
