looks at the workshop hardly seminars is going to be dealing with family businesses and some of the challenges unique challenges they face a what what do you hope to the message you want to spread through that and the teach some of the members of the audience to continue their success or over time\nWell you know when you when you go through a changes of leadership and and that ... companies that have been run by families often it very difficult transition uh because\nUh that oftentimes the family members that really not necessarily have the background to be able to lead and take on the
