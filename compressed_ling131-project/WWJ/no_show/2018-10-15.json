us today for inside retirement Motor City edition powered by retirement planning edu dot com high everyone I'm making most act is a pleasure to be here with Kurt Cassidy and Dr Paul ... president and co president of senior planning advisors\nGreat show for it today and each and every week we talk retirement here on the shall we talk about how to become more confident about retirement how to get educated about all that's involved in retirement planning and boy there's a lot to learn\nSo you're going to come away from today's show with a lot of great insight and information on how to attend courses taught by Kirk in Paul coming up at a location near you stay tuned for information on that\nKirk Paul great to be with you today\nIt's great to be here good to be here\nWhen it's hot you about all that's involved with retirement planning and these days retirement planning it's a lot different right it's different than previous generations where it was a lot more straightforward there's a lot to know and that means taking a holistic approach but Kirk Paul when we say that word holistic\nWhat that really mean that is what I Want to dive in today and talk to you about so far has listed planning ... what should we know about that\nMake it I think part of the challenge when we talked about holistic planning it seems to become have become a buzzword in our industry everyone pretends or suggest that they do comprehensive holistic planning and when we think of holistic planning\nIt's literally looking at things in a global way in a global fashion understanding when we're going to take income from which accounts at what age so to reduce\nTaxation reduce the chances of outliving our money considering all different types of asked it's almost like a a puzzle like you have a bunch of individual puzzle pieces\nAnd if you take a holistic approach we can take in connect all those individual puzzle pieces into one single puzzle that all fits together\nAnd the challenge for a lot of our listeners is we have been taught conditioned our whole life by our industry to focus on individual things making\nIndividual things making decisions in isolation looking at one investment versus the other investment in determining which one is going to be better for them often based upon which one is performed best in the last five years or ten years\nYou know I ... you know this idea of holistic planning you you made this comment that to everybody says it's so so before the show I Googled holistic returned playing\nDo you know how many hits I I I Would say eight million [laughter] two hundred and forty thousand hits seriously eight million hits yeah right they we hear about you know everything's holistic right but at the end of the day if\nWe really tried you know sort of drill down into this to us a holistic planning is really trying to understand you\nWrite what are your values what's important to you what do you need right what do you want to do in your life right is understanding your needs your objectives your concerns when we look at the statistics only four percent of retirees actually have a written plan for retirement represent credible\nAnd and you got to understand the probability of whether or not you're going to outlive your money is not a plan a plan is going to look at your entire situation\nAll the different variables we're going to map out every single year how much you need when you need it and we're to take it from and do it in a manner that's going to reduce the chances of outliving your money\nIn one way that we can impact outliving our money not outliving our money is reducing how much we pay in taxes\nNow this is where we really get sort of technical in our class where we help you prepare we're or the traps rate we're are the stakes were what am I spending patterns in my go go years the slogan gears in the no go years\nHow do you know how much you're going to need when and why\nAnd in in the problem is is our industry wants to cookie cutter all of this right our our industry is built on a business model of maintaining a transactional business ... meaning they want to meet as many as you of you view as they can\nSell as much as they can to you so they can move on to the next person which means everyone's going to get a cookie cutter plan as opposed to an individual plan holistic plant that outlines your specific needs goals concerns based upon the asset you have and what you've accomplished to date in\nYour life so let me let me just give an example put a face to this I Am thinking of the tax class we talked last night\nAnd I'm thinking about this idea of winner take Social Security right ... ... ... and I think you know most people make this decision because you Google\nAnd you get you get you know this calculator tells you want to take it and I think of the example you gave in the class which showed that that individual can take Social Security early and pay no taxes right so the question would be should you take Social Security early if you pay no taxes versus waiting later and paying taxes\nFor your listener if you're not paying taxes on your cells could eat it may be better to take it early and may not but for some of it is so it's independent it really depends on you as a person not on everybody right now that everybody\nAnd I think Paul nailed it when with the question about holistic it's an individual plan\nAnd I'm Sorry to say I I I Know some there's some people on radio there's some people if you Google him the next ten callers are the next ten emails or going to give you a free roadmap to retirement and Meghan just think for a minute\nHow can someone produce five hundred and twenty plans such ten per week fifty two weeks ago you're helping someone produce five hundred and twenty plans and make it individual to each person I can only tell you Meghan we've had we last year we helped eighty one people we said no\nNo to two hundred and we helped eighty one people because that's all we could do\nIn help if we were going to design an individual plan\nSo let's talk about our class re so typically every month cooking I teach a class at local universities\nAre we teach a class University of Michigan eastern Michigan University Michigan State university at the Novi campus this is a seven to eight hour course are offered typically over either to evenings to date times\nSometimes we offered over a whole Saturday So it's an eight hour class on a Saturday two hundred page textbook people pay to attend this class and the reason why we want people to pay\nIs because we know if you have skin in the game you're actually going to pay attention you're not going to sit there and yourself when you're going to actually have some skin in the game you're going to really want to learn normally we charge forty nine dollars to attend this class for you listening we're going to reduce after twenty nine dollars\n[noise] again two hundred

I Know you agree with is probably the easiest piece from ... in advisors perspective to plan for probably the easiest peace but the problem is if all of your money is sitting in the stock market all of it's in the stock market where there is this thing called sequence of return risk right now most of you probably know nothing about that we talk about in her class\nBut if in the first five years or retirement we have a huge market correction out even huge not even huge just a just a ten percent loss in later you're saying the U.S in the second ... what's the impact if there's a market correction the first five ... five years what's the impact it destroys their retirement we use the ... this example upon the class\nWe show an example where a investor I'm a married couple and retirement has an average rate of return of ten percent\nAnd they're just going to take out five percent a year to live on\nSo they're performing at ten percent they're ... they're taking out five percent and they run out of money and Seventeen years now all of you are probably ... saying he's making that up and not tell me what happened in the first five years a retirement\nAnd that will determine whether you outlive your money or not because at the end of the day if you're a drawing income withdrawing income from accounts that are going down in value\nObviously that becomes problematic because by the time to those accounts go up\nYou you only less of that asset so it's harder to recover recalled that reverse dollar cost averaging we do now unless you know not something that you actually may know what the stock market is going to do the first five years of retirement right and if you do I want to meet you [laughter] okay [laughter] and most of us do not write most of us don't\nAnd that's why just having a brokerage account is not a holistic plant Megan do you know what it's going to do in the market's going to do the next couple of years current my crystal ball is broken\nIs broken [laughter] All right though I have just jak him because if you have that information I think we'd be very popular right now [laughter]\nIndeed you know this isn't a lot there really is so much to consider and as you said there are no do overs in retirement that is a sobering thought you want to get this right you cover so much of what we're talking about today in that at your courses your classes that are taught all throughout the year tell our listeners more\nSo pollen I've been teaching classes for I think seven years now and I'm proud to say the classes were teaching are now being taught at three hundred different colleges and universities around the country\nSo this course is on almost an eight hour course and we teach it over to evenings or one full Saturday and it's a long day and it's a lot of information\nThis is not a free dinner seminar you have to pay to attend it's going to cost you twenty nine dollars and we're going to donate that that tuition that you're paying we're going to donate directly to charity\nWe're going to go step by step through a two hundred page textbook\nIt's going to get very much into the weeds we're gonna get technical it's in inter action right we're going to have a dialogue questions and answers and we're going to take you through this two hundred page textbook\nAnd I'm pretty convinced after doing the seven years there are very few people that have left our class not feeling like they're significantly better prepared to to get to and through retirement\nThe course is taught in held at the University of Michigan eastern Michigan University in Michigan State university the Novi campus\nThe again the cost is twenty nine dollars for you and aghast that means you in a spouse or you and aghast\nIf you'd like to register for one of these classes we teach them every month you can go to retirement planning edu dot com retirement planning edu dot com or you can call one eight hundred to for oh eight nine one one eight hundred to for oh eight nine eight one\nPlease understand if you call your calling a call center who is simply there to take your registration and take your credit card payments but if you like to learn more about the course and check out the syllabus you can go to retirement planning edu\nDot com again no do overs in retirement don't let another day go by without doing something proactive for your future get registered today that number again eight hundred to four zero eighty nine eighty one and the website\nRetirement planning edu dot com much more with ...

I mean that's one small example of so many turns on the roads that people are going to face in retirement\nYou know I'm just thinking on a personal note I'm thinking of my father we have different fathers right but the mother and father but I'm thinking about in my father who had Louis body dementia and at some point or struggled with driving and and and we were all afraid and we you know he was forced to retire he was forced to give up control over most of the things in life\nAnd he fought us right he didn't want to do this right but Paul everybody's going to say they understand that and recognize that yeah the problem is they're all going to say it's not going to happen to me ... I'm Still young I'm invincible I got ... I I have a new client that recently diagnosed with cancer is going to die within two weeks\nAfter six months just right never thought it was him has nothing in or\nHasn't any still isn't retired we don't even know retires and retired right right and he's missed out on it it never happens it's not never going to happen to us\nAnd that's why the sooner the better you got to start preparing planning and again I Know it's it's it's a little bit more but you know and in negative but you have to plan for the worst because the worst could happen\nAnd I'd rather be over prepared than under prepared in how to make a massive mistake so let's let's let's let's let's\nLet's let's let's let's create some Lebanese for a moment of feeling a little heavier right now and let's talk about a positive turn out of its positive turn but other turns on the road and and one of those I think about\nIs is oftentimes we hear clients say right every three to four years you'll give the exact statistic right yeah they they want to do that you know they have an at one time expense right all of a sudden you have and renovated your kitchen and now you want to write or you haven't taken that huge trip\nAnd I want to write or all of a sudden you have grandchildren and I want to start doing things for them and and so part of that turn as you got to make sure you have the liquidity to do that and you have to plan for that right if you don't plan for that then you won't be able to do it people\nThink that I got liquid he they have it in my investments but that isn't the right kind of liquidity we're looking for because we never know when there's going to be an emergency or an unexpected expense that we want and didn't disappear before and we know we know Paul and I know it's going to happen about every three point two years\nSo if we know that can happen every three point two years we can plan ahead to make sure that we're not forced to take money out of investments that are volatile in those times that's the kind of liquidity we're talking about liquidity that's available to be had without volatility impacting the outcome of it\nRight and that's all part of holistic planning right at the end of the day it's about making sure we have liquidity it's making sure we've covered for all those one time expense is right it's about planning for the worst and hoping for the best right\nHow about this one Paul how about the term that they realized three years after they retire to wait a second I'm not going to be able to live on Seventy eight percent of my income rate of ... yeah\nBecause the book is wrong I'm telling you the book applies the rule applies to everybody who ... for most explain the rules what's the bill ... says that that you'll be able to live on Seventy eight percent of your income in retirement\nThe problem with the rule is they're using a study that took a broad um sample of people\nOf which thirty percent were only living on Social Security that skews the data translation if you have resources you save money and you have the access to the money and the availability of the money\nYou're not going to live on Seventy eight percent of the income you might start your retirement trying to do that\nBut the term will be about two to three years in which we see all the time because people don't want to leave us is that loops I'm actually spending more in retirement than I was spending during my working years because all of a sudden I have twenty five hundred extra hours a year to to do things travel and\nThe resources and the resource right and the resources so let's take a minute and talk about the class because in the class we dig deeper into the subject right\nThis is the classic Kirk and I teach every month typically uh every month at local universities to teach the University of Michigan eastern Michigan University Michigan State university and then over by campus and it's a seven to eight hour course\nMost often covered over two days to evenings sometimes we do a full Saturday for people can't go during the week it is a lot of material and I will say all of you you get educated about everything in your life\nThis is a subject you probably need to get educated on okay so if you want it ten Darkhorse the course of twenty nine dollars that's for you and a spouse or a partner okay it is twenty nine dollars and again covers two days of course work\nIf you're interested and you want to attend you can go to a retirement planning edu dot com retirement planning edu dot com you can register\nYou can read about us you can read about the things that we're going to cover you can also called eight hundred to ...\nThe ... to ... eight nine eight one eight hundred to four or eight nine eight one\nYou can register when you call just remember you're calling us all center and all they're able to do was register you take your much more\nWith her Kennedy and Dr ... straight ahead [noise]\nTraffic and whether together W.
