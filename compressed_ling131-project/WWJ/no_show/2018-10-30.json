against the same team and we saw some things that we can do better with ... execution wise\nBall movement and most of all defensively I I don't uh Boston shot the ball the best they've shot at all exhibition and regular season so we got to do a better job of guarding our man one on one or making sure we get to the shooters and and make it a tougher shot and make them feel as I don't\nI don't know if they felt us in the entire first have I thought we got into it after the in the second half a little bit but\nYou can't wait that long is a good team and to to turn it on\nThose interesting obviously they went after after Blake and were successful but the the first guy they had on the scale and brown was was that a surprise at all not really because it took place the\nStrength you know if he's outside bringing the ball down in for which he had been doing has been doing and does an excellent job of\nA they felt like J. lo would match up with him now what they did they did a good job of keeping him out of his sweet spot in the post war Blake has an advantage so we got to do a better job of finding Blake\nOr whether it's in transition or half court play if the front and we've got the high low action if they we get down to ... early ... got to do a good job of running the floor instead of bringing it down get into a sweet spot and and get some early post office before they can get back and get loaded up on them because they were sending\nLike you said the kitchen sink to him but we've got to do a better job of lunch spacing moving the ball and getting the ball to him\nEarlier in the shot caught so right now you're averaging twenty assess which is which is low or is that a product of missing shots or is that a product of of not moving the ball\nWell not moving the ball and missing shot at it as a bad combination is\nUm but you know some of it is you know once you put it on flow Blake's is I sew situation where\nYou know I uh we we do put the ball and floor of quite a bit but again ball movement is huge in this late especially if you have a permit score that teams are trying to load up on if you don't move the ball or you're not going to be teams today in one on one you got to move the ball get it to the weeks out hopefully get to the ... get to the\nThree lines uh and and we have not done a good job of doing that far\nReggie Jackson is he still try to get used to play an off the ball a little bit\nYes and that's that's all going a process with him I think it's going once he gets used to it it's going to help them because it gives us another ball handling another pick enroll got on the floor\nUm with yeah show Jose whoever else is on the floor you when you can play with two point guards and Reggie seizing the shooting ability gives them an opportunity to one hide on the weak side rest a little bit get people off his body and still create and I mean it doesn't take away anything from him not have\nAn opportunity to handle the ball and play with the basketball they issued enhanced his office of output\nVital thing that's the Celtics what you expect this time Dale ... will not be ready hurt you or the other night so what do you expect this time what do you have to do well\nIs going to be a huge ... he's he's a guy that also is picking a pop and right now is shooting at three um but again our transition deepest has to be on
