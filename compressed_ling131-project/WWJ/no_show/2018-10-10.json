cool factor and the camera how does the new pixel three match up\nWell who factor it's doing pretty well ah people really like the different colors that comes in which is a they've got a a black or white and then what they called not pink which is\nKind of an on off I think if you will um it's an interesting idea it's not me on paying by any stretch I so the design is something that they're getting pretty good marks for and also they are offering something different you know a lot of the problem that people have these days\nIs that pretty much every phone comes down to a screen on a metal slab they all basically do the same thing what Google is trying to do is offer different software so for example\nOr one of the things Google's of pixel is what they're called pixel funds are able to do is that they will actually I identify of phone calls that looks like a spam call coming in to you and they will have the Google Assistant which is there artificial intelligence that competes with Syria and whatnot um do have that\nPick up instead and it'll start showing your transcription of the call and if you think it's ... just hit with a button and never have to deal with it again\nUm they did the same thing also they did a lot of smart stuff around the camera where it's supposed to have much better low white or capabilities and even the cell the camera actually zoom out not just zooming in but zooms out so that you can uh get more of your friends in the photo at any given time\nApple's iPhones cost a lot of money how about the pixel trees price point\nWell they are cheaper than the iPhones you know the whole world seems to have gone for the thousand dollar phone or so and ever since the iPhones and came out last year or most of the high end phones had their prices rise so Google is offering a this thing for around seven hundred dollars depending on which size you want\nA which is a pretty good deal and are they are offering also uh they're doing a lot of other stuff to try and entice you for example they're giving you access to their to back up your photos in full quality and stuff like that without having to pay extra money so they tried they tried to Sweden that deal with much they can\nWhere does the new home hub and sleep tablet rank\nSo I certainly I we're gonna have to review them and test them over it seen it because uh these home ... and the slave tablets are new by ah one of the things that's interesting is seeing these companies trying to both take on each other and offer something new so the slate tablet\nAll right ah one of the things that's interesting is seeing these companies trying to both take on each other and offer something new so\nThe slate tablet for example is kind of like the I've had pro or the uh Microsoft Surface which both are very much like within the tech industry primarily because\nThey are white they're easy to use the keyboards are good enough to be able to replace a laptop and they weigh something like half or less than that of a normal laptop\nAnd they have better battery life so people love those devices so Google's are able to offer something similar and you know they say it has a lot of security in it that it's much better for Internet use then they'll have a pretty good a contender there\nWith the Google Home hub one of the interesting thing there is that they are trying to take on a you know the the Amazon has a thing called the echo show which is like those little hockey puck things that everyone's been giving each other that are have elected in the but what's interesting here is that the the Google One\nWill actually have the ability to watch Youtube videos they're doing all these other things that try and again kind of get you in and of course they're going to work with Google Photos to that it'll automatically show you the best photos or on your and home whenever it's just sitting there in either way\nIf you're buying a Google phone you'd probably have a Gmail account you're thinking you're calendars that way plus you do all your searching through Google or their privacy concerns with all these tech companies gathering so much information\nI

scientific studies um and they concluded that we are warming up the planet by human activity by everything that we do so fast that we're reaching the cliff edge a little faster\nQuite a bit faster so most of these wounds are self inflicted by us what are we doing\nOn what warms up the planet I'm according to a scientific consensus is greenhouse gas emissions how the greenhouse gas emissions got into the atmosphere from cars and trucks from plane I'm from agriculture even I'm a produces greenhouse gas emissions\nShow and the consequences are really quite dire one planet heats up to a certain level you have much higher chances of a heat waves that can be potentially very fatal wildfires the likes of which we have seen this year\nCoastal flooding because of the rise lots of people millions and millions of people who live on the U.S coast and all around the world um remember we've got lots of capital city has lots of airports along the coastline so those are in danger and huge economic losses\nLet me also have the geopolitical effects that happened when you have droughts and food shortages country started to go in and take the resources of other countries you start to have all kinds

no longer a wakeup call you know we should all be awake we should all be walk by now I'm On on this that the good news is that for a very long time policymakers scientists politicians have known exactly um the main things that need to be done right so\nThey are hard they're not easy because it means moving the global economy really quickly really profoundly that means weaning off of things like using coal you and I don't use coal but the world as a whole relies on coal for like ... right right it is the largest source of the single largest source of electricity\nSo uh it means switching from coal to renewable energy like solar and wind\nUp it means figuring out how to get from place to place be without putting oil in our in our cars\nUm there are engineering solutions there are lots of very smart scientists trying to figure out how to suck that carbon out of the atmosphere and there are non engineering solutions like forests not how to preserve our forest which act as a huge
