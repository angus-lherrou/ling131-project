Motor City edition powered by retirement planning edu dot com highest negatives act and it's a pleasure to be here with Kurt Cassidy and Dr Paul ...\nPresident and co president of senior planning advisors we have a lot to get to hear on the show and stay tuned because later on we're going to give you information on how you can attend courses that\nStay tuned because later on we're going to give you information on how you can attend courses that Kirk and Paul hold all throughout the year these retirement planning courses are taught in communities right where you are so stay tuned for information to get registered for it does\nYeah Kirk and Paul October has been interesting on Wall street we can't wait another day without talking about what happened on October tenth this was this second steep decline we saw in fact it was the second Steve that since February of this year the market\nReally took a tunnel we thought tax tax dropped and a lot of consumer confidence fell with that now you're getting close to retirement correct me if I'm wrong this can make people little rattled right\nIt certainly can Megan you know what's interesting about that market drop in and there's a number of things that we're going to talk about obviously through this uh this next hour work together but it's interesting how correlated these market fluctuations in volatility is to the fed making a move right\nThe last time we saw a drop like this have happened in February what happened in February the sad raised interest rates again just like it did the other day now I you know I Would argue I'm not sure that we're losing much consumer confidence you're given you were having record gross a profits\nWith our corporate earnings and and the market just popped right back up the next day here right so\nWe got to be careful it's it's really about trying to manage our emotions particularly as we get into retirement or close to retirement it's not the daily volatility that we see in the markets managing our emotions and we're only going to do that through proper planning you know it's interesting that guy\nHad a meeting earlier today with somebody and uh this is a client but it's a new client let me just preface this by saying it's a very new client\nAnd immediately his response to me today was well maybe I won't take as much income right maybe I won't take as much income given the market volatility so I had to stop and sit down with him and say look let's sit back and look at the plan that you have\nAnd let's remind ourselves where are you getting your income from and once I showed him that at least for the next many years his income is not coming from accounts are highly volatile he was able to relax but the problem was\nHe still thinking the way he thought before I met us right he's still in this sort of accumulation mindset where he's been trained in the past to focus on taking money from accounts that are highly volatile and I had sort of bring them back\nTo what we've ... this whole idea of planning and once I did that it was like yeah I guess I guess I don't have to\nWorry as much well I think that's Paul the purpose of our classes right we talk about this regularly in our classes that are held at University of Michigan eastern Michigan University in Michigan State nobody campus and\nAnd you know what we teach there's first of all with only four percent of retirees having a written plan of course if you don't have a plan when the market of is is volatile and fluctuating like this\nThere's going to be an overreaction and you're right Paul people have really struggle transitioning to this new phase of life where they allow money to serve them and the reason they struggle and they can't live retirement with the\nConfidence in the peace of mind they showed us because they don't plan they haven't mapped out where they're going to take their money from from which account at what age\nAnd it's something Paul you and I talk about regularly\nThat you must take your income from accounts that don't have volatility particularly in early in retirement or you're not it's not going to work\nTo correct correct and so so am I going to go back to I think your initial question you know yes we've had a lot of ... right I mean there are a couple of days that I think you know there were some anxiety the first and probably most important thing to do when you see the volatility is\nRight I mean there are a couple of days that I think you know there were some anxiety the first and probably most important thing to do\nWhen you see that volatility is do nothing right just don't do anything don't panic\nAnd don't react in that easy for cooking either say right it's easy when I retired right and we're not living on everything that we saved but do we have a plan and we have a plan so that the end of the day right if you have a plan and its mapped out correctly\nThe thing to do is not to react and and I will say this and I don't say this this not meant to brag it all but I Will say we rarely get calls\nWhen the market drops the other day when it was down with a thousand points I didn't get a call right one not want it and again it's because\nOur clients know where their money comes from every single month for the rest next Thirty years and it's all built in the plan is we build in the plan this sort of market volatility\nThat's powerful though that statement you just made Paul Kirk that you didn't get a call and I think most people would assume some nervous people that goes to show you you're doing something right when you're sitting down with your clients when you're planning\nYou're creating a plan that gives them confidence so they are they're not worrying with every market death for correction right\nMeg and that doesn't come just right at the beginning of our relationship again every client that we work with we require them to attend our seven hour course in a university setting and after they become a client we've then continue to educate our clients every quarter events that we called luncheon learns and dinner and learns\nSo that people can become a more discipline investor not overreact when we have market volatility and allow headlines to dictate when they're going to take money or whether what they should invest in or try to time the market\nThese are recipes for mistakes and retirement it starts with a clear plan a holistic planned understanding when how why what taxes on when the pay we're the traps are\n... for example we know every three point two years we're going to have an unexpected expense we didn't plan for so if we know that's going to happen and we can build that into the plan\nWill then we can avoid making big mistakes so we'd like to make an offer we'd like to invite everybody as we do every week on a radio show we want to invite\nOf our listeners to attend one of our courses that are held at the University of Michigan eastern

is inside retirement\nMotor City edition Howard by retirement planning edu dot com or so glad that you've joined us today we've been talking about market volatility and that brings up a topic that I think sometimes\nPaul encourage people just get confused by it's a big phrase and not everyone understands it so let's go back to school here Abad Kirk\nSequence of return ... what is it why does it matter to me\nSo I'd first asked to all of our listeners if you're driving even if you're not driving raise your hands okay don't raise your hands keep your hands on the wheel but if you ever heard of the term sequence of return risk and I'm likely you have it and you you should probably learn a little bit about this this is\nThis is an issue a really big issue that causes many people to fail in outlive their money but it's the secret our industry doesn't want you to know about it's often avoided by our industry and it's really simple\nWhat will determine if you are successful in not outliving your money it won't be the average rate of return you get on your investments but the sequence when you get the returns on your investments will dry weather you outlive your money or not\nThis is really hard for people understand even when you see it at first it takes a few minutes in fact in our class we literally spend about thirty minutes talking about this topic in show\nFive or six different examples so people fully can comprehend how dangerous and what the challenges are industry typically uses average rates of return and everything is stuff's been driven on performance of average rates of return\nI can show you how someone has a ... average seven percent rate of return over a ten year period\nAnd you lost money okay so it's when the returns occur in one of the greatest examples we have in our class is an example where we show somebody that has a million dollars and averages a ten and a half percent rate of return before they\nIs an example of where we show somebody that has a million dollars and averages of ten and a half percent rate of return before they reach tire right there just averaging ten and a half percent returns not to get any money out and their money grossed over five million dollars and everyone's you know excited in wild by it\nThen we show the same exact example but this time we show eight ten and a half percent ready to return and we take five percent out to live on so we're going to take fifty thousand dollars a year out of the million dollars every single year and get an average rate of return of ten percent\nAnd we will show you how you can run out of money and Seventeen years it's I Know it's a logical it's hard to comprehend but if you lose money early in retirement if you lose early money and my example you will run out of money and Seventeen years if you lose it late you still have two and a half million dollars thirty\nYears later it's sort of makes sense if you think about it if you dig a hole I think what you're saying if\nIf you dig a hole early it's hard to get out it's hard to get out I write it if if you start and you retire and you start drawing a lot of money out when the ... the accounts of going down\nYou dig a hole so soon it's really difficult to recover yeah in the problem Paul think about this whole industry we've all been conditioned our whole lives to be focused on performance performance performance\nAverage rates returns the first question everyone wants to ask you\nSo what's your average rate of return over the last five years okay well it's ten percent but my clients lost money right\nIf you lost money earlier claims lost money it sets them up for failure in our industry doesn't want to confront it because it's easier to sell using average rates of return versus real rates of return yeah and it is ... ... and I think\nYou know we use the example in the class the mountain and you know when you're working you started going up the mountain and your focus is accumulation\nAnd in retirement it's about preservation distribution I think part of the issue is when you're working in your accumulating and you're not withdrawing money well then all you think about is the rates of return right as long as you're never touching the money then you don't really think about sequence of return risk\nThe problem is when you start drawing money out if it's which is it's not about that now it's about distributions and preservation\nAnd that's what the sequence return becomes a problem so hold on you you just made me think of something Paul so the typical response we get well is if we lose money in in a particular market in the year I just won't take a distribution right wait a second we can't do that\nRight we have to take a requirement um distributions when we're Seventeen and a half whether we want it or not whether the market is up or down we still have to take income out of our accounts\nFor from our IRAs and her for one case right so that's the problem so one of the things that we talk about in the class\nIs the importance of asset allocation right at the end of the day if we can somehow create a plan where you're not forced to take your distributions from things that are a volatile\nAnd then we don't have that sequence a return risk correctly and that's where it again I Know we use asset allocation and that's usually when people change station so please don't changes the equation\nBut asset allocation part of asset allocation is understanding where and when to take income from which accounts and what Paul saying is is we want to be really careful that we're taking our income\nFrom accounts that don't have volatility particularly early and that will increase the likelihood of you succeeding that only happens though if you plan if you plant and I'm sincerely we don't have the right it's like anything if you're wing it and you don't plan for them that you know they even have to draw money from whatever accounts you have to draw from\nBut if you plan and you make sure that you segregate some accounts\nThat have no volatility right this is the way to prevent that and this is what we talk about in the class right well we do we talk about it all the time\nOnce that have no volatility right this is a way to prevent that and this is what we talk about in the class right\nWell we do we talk about it all the time in the class and we view of many different examples and this was just one of the risk of many in retirement\nI I'm hoping that our listeners are starting to recognize\nThat this isn't something Paul use the term wing it there is no dual verse and what's interesting about that Paul is we've done a lot of research on this and there's actually been studies about people who make financial mistakes and how many years it takes them before they recognize they made that mistake and what's interesting studies show that it's seven years\nAfter you make a financial mistake before you realize you made that mistake\nNow think about that you've retired you're sixty seven years old and now you make a mistake it's Seventy four years old before you know you make that mistake or realize you made that mistake\nIs no way to fix it do not do overseas right you know I you know cook this leads to a\nConversation that we don't have time for but we should at some point talk about do yourself first right people who do this and the challenge of doing this yourself ... ... and preventing sequence a return rescued and excitement I think it's a good idea so let's talk about a class of cooking I teach this class\nTypically every month it's held at a variety of different universities\nUniversity of Michigan eastern Michigan University Michigan State university than over by campus and soon open university ah it's seven to eight hours of course work typically over two days sometimes we do an all day Saturday it's a two hundred page textbook\nTwenty nine dollars to attend and we cover all of this at the end of the day it's about educating all of you to the you understand how to prevent these mistakes that you could potentially face\nSo if you're interested and you want to learn about this

I mean it goes back to the original point of the show right we we started the show by talking about market volatility and what the risks associated with that are in why and\nThe original point of the show right we we started the show by talking about market volatility and what the risks associated with that are in why\nAnd and then we transition and to do it yourself first in the most common practice people use do it yourself or or even most brokers and visor are using a ruler called the four percent rule and I'm sure all your listeners have heard this and if you're a regular listener of the show we've talked about this a lot\nAnd the challenges if you're going to use a four percent rule meaning you're going to take half your money put in stocks half your money put in bonds and take four percent a year out every single year for the rest of your life\nWhat will determine whether or not you outlive your money and be successful or not is what happens with market volatility really in retirement that is going to determine whether you're successful or not\nAnd that is like rolling the dice in my opinion we don't have crystal balls no one can tell us what the market's going to do tomorrow we certainly have opinions deal to flattening we have all these\nTriggers to help give us guidance\nBut we know that the market isn't all that predictable over the last ten to Fifteen Years based upon what we think it's going to do so in addition to that Kurt at Seventy and a half years old what do you have to start doing yet start taking a requirement of distribution at about four percent\nAnd that goes up every year right correct by the time you're eighty Paul it's over a ... it's almost six percent so the the rule says that we're all following that you should take four percent a year out but yet the IRS says that we have to take out by the time were eighty almost six percent out of our I raise our for one case\nSo the four percent rule fails for everybody as soon as you get over four percent with requirement distributions and that is the whole premise of our industry and do it yourself first have built their retirement plan on a four percent rule that is set up for failure right off the start\nAnd that's why we teach the class and that's why we talked about all the different risks associated with planning and when and how to take income from which accounts at what age and how to manage the volatility\nWell I think you know Kirk you just said something that that you sort of set it quickly but it's really important which is\nKnowing where to take income from which accounts at what age\nThat or not that's not four percent rule that's actually strategically thinking about what accounts of the best accounts take from for ... from income that's different than just taking four percent and at the end of the if you're a strategic and I know in the class you actually get some examples of the difference between strategic and not\nAnd how it impacts your life for the rest of your life well the biggest\nFactor of being strategic with income two biggest factors one is sequence of return is making sure we don't live our money right 'cause we we we cannot predict what the market volatility is going to be in the future\nSecond is taxes rate if we're strategic about when we take income from which accounts at what age we can manage what we're paying taxes for the rest of our lives\nThat's something we spent a lot of time in the class talking about by the time people attend our class complete our class\nEvery one is able to project out what they're going to have to take out in requirement distributions what their Social Security is going to be what percentage of the Social Security is going to be taxable and how to calculate that and they can project out into the future what tax bracket they're going to be in so they can make better decisions now\nBefore Seventy to reposition assets and a lower tax bracket so they can lower their tax back at the rest of their lives right you know I get a mouthful estimate and but it was it was it was but it was\nI mean so at the end of the day if you're seven and a half years old and you're taking four percent out on an account that's going down right\nWas but it was good I mean so at the end of the day if you're seven and a half years old\nAnd you're taking four percent out on an account that's going down right\nAnd you're taking out from accounts that you've never pay taxes on pretext accounts like I raised four O. one K. is et cetera right if you're paying a lot of taxes and you're drunk from accounts that are going down that seems to me like a recipe for disaster\nWell that that's why a lot of people fail outlive their money in retirement\nSo which is really sad Paul it's really sad when we should watch so many people that have the resources have everything they need to have a successful retirement to be able to do all the things that they wanted to do in retirement right think
