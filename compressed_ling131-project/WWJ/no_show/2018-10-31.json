leading the Celtics fifty eight fifty six at the half out of\nGarden and you know the first couple of things really that you notice erupted twenty four minutes of action just kind of comparing this one to what we saw on Saturday\nWith the Celtics dominating in a one on Nineteen eighty nine when the pistons route hustling yourself is right now you know this isn't you know some aboard the pistons are you know being just out challenging essentially the Boston Celtics no\nThe Celtics have mortality Celtic do the best team in the eastern conference this is the pistons coming out and putting together solid defensive possessions being able to get you know a few turnovers from the Celtics the Celtics missing some looks being forced into some bad shots and on the other end\nYou've seen the pistons attacked the officer blasts whether it be Stanley Johnson coming down with one Andre drumming continue could you put it in a solid effort on the officer blast with some put backs that's been the difference also you know the pistons are unsettling for as many three pointers as we were seeing on Saturday either\nSo far Eighteen free throws for the pistons Seventeen of Eighteen is actually what they've had so far so that tells you that they're being a little bit more aggressive they're not settling for threes pistons\nThree of twelve from beyond a three point line I'd have to pull up\nAnd maybe I can hear wall you know I'm sitting here talking about this first havoc and pull up the numbers from Saturday's game but it did feel as though\nThe pistons were settling for a lot at three pointers in that game when in reality that's not necessarily how they're going to be able to you know when games moving forward the pistons fourteen don't miss Boston seven uh thirty seven\nFrom beyond a three point line for the pistons on Saturday\nWay last three point attempts so far here in the first half\nFor the pistons I Do think that that is very very critical you don't want to separate just because Boston giving you know open looks from the outside doesn't mean you have to take them all the time Blake Griffin changing at least a little bit how he wants to attack this Boston defenses well not settling for jumpers getting to the lie Griffin six or six\nFrom the free stripe and this one does have a couple of turnovers but given the amount of volume and the amount of touches he's going to get for this team you're kind of have to live with the Griffin a double figures of twelve points and for rebounds also three of six from the field so not forcing anything up you know not\nIm you're kind of have to live with a Griffin and double figures of twelve points and for rebounds also three of six from the field to not forcing anything up you know not taking a bunch of threes no three point attempts in that first tap Griffin trying to get to the ram and trying to get to the free throw line Andrea drumming also\nAnd double figures for the pistons which well points and seven rebounds\nSix of twelve from the field as I mentioned\nDoing a lot of his work inside he's got three ... as well so drumming getting some of those second chance look some easy put backs and those are going to be the place and this one that ultimately could deliver the pistons victory in Boston Reggie Jackson also with eight points in Eighteen minutes to of six from the field couple of his is\nDoes have a couple of turnovers as well I read the book hard to figure out so far to start this year\nJust not shooting it well one of seven from the field over for from beyond a three point line he's got to find that for the pistons he was so key or were there shooting from the outside just a season to go is Smith coming off that pistons bench\nWhich seven points in eleven minutes ... once again\nFive points in eleven minutes two rebounds too is is a steel doing a little bit of everything really\nFor the pistons coming off the bench Bruce Brown the rookie also with six minutes in his first half clearly getting some of the minutes that Luke ... isn't going to be able to take over the next couple of weeks that shoulder injury\nBruce Brown with four points to have three from the field\nHe had to block a couple of nice defensive possessions as well so uh if you are seeing that you're doing Casey you're probably really liked that are just six minutes but Bruce Brown a with effective minutes off that pistons bench couple and double figures for the Celtics as well\nKyrie Irving with twelve in sixteen minutes for seven from the field he wasn't as much of a factor in Saturday's win for the Celtics over the pistons so\nMaybe you'll see a little bit more of him here especially in the second half it was the bench for the Celtics that was on real on Saturday afternoon Marcus more is also the former piston with eleven points in Fifteen minutes of action off the Boston bench but you know Tatum just seven points hey we're limited to just for\n... brown also with just three you know a lot of open looks for the Celtics and it just doesn't seem like they're able to knock him down at this point so a pistons\nHave an opportunity here to go into Boston and get a victory and right now they look like the team that wants it more so than the Boston Celtics pistons not have been shooting at you know all that well just forty one percent from the field forty nine percent for Boston but\nWith forty six field goal temps compared to forty one for the Celtics clearly the offensive rebounds to put back you know the second chance opportunities\nIt that's playing a pivotal role through twenty four minutes of play turnovers relatively down pistons were sick Celtics\nWas seven turnovers in that first half a lot of falls a lot of free throws piston Seventeen of Eighteen from the free throw line so can you do like the aggression that you're seeing out of the pistons here\nCleveland Cavaliers [noise]\nI'll jailing brown I'm fake had\nBully govern the air couldn't get a
