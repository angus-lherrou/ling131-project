there and generally jak alongside represents the president of the birds in the group which has been helping people throughout the metro Detroit area with retirements since Nineteen eighty eight welcome to inside retirement Motor City edition thanks so much for joining us today before\nWe get started if you would like to speak with Brad Pitt and his team you can reach them by calling eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one that number again is eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one the website is maximize my retirement dot com\nSo everyone has their own unique vision of retirement to their idea of how they'll spend their days during this next phase of life\nNo matter what it is you like to do whatever that vision there's one thing you're going to need to make that decision of reality and that's at what type of assets exactly well we've come up with a list of some of the most important assets for retirement in some effective ways to maximize each of them any a wet Brett\nWe're not just talking about money here are we\nAre we're not definitely not I mean there's there's so many different things of value or you know that we want to try to get our hands on or to uh you know grasp as we head into retirement and\nAnd obviously today we're going to cover a few of those different ideas um you you know but I think it's important to describe that for the purposes of our discussion today Gen these might necessarily be a you know the obvious things that are tangible mhm uh things that we could obviously a touch\nBut there's also things that are intangible a you know something that's perhaps more conceptual a yet definitely has some value to it and and both of those are going to be well represented today but\nI think the very first thing we should talk about today perhaps is one of those intangible things ... a ... and I think that that is you know time to time right as a valuable asset okay yeah right I think\nA perhaps our most valuable asset is time and that really what I mean by that is as it applies to retirement planning I meet with families here in our offices every single day um\nWho call in and and listen to a radio program or or referred to to us by another family\nAnd you know they come in from all walks of life some of them are in the early fifties someone there late fifties some in their seventies ah and they're all different stage in life and the one constant that I think ah I hear time and time again from those who come and see me when they're\nIn their seventies is man I Wish I would've met with you or sat down and heard you uh when I was in my fifties you know when I had more time to make adjustments to my overall strategy is to get it right and time is obviously something we can never get back and\nAnd yes today is is better late than never a but for those who have time up there as it pertains to getting ready for retirement\nIt really can't be too soon\nThink that's such an interesting concept to brag that you're right time is the one asset we just can't get back we can make more money we can sell things off we can do different things financially but time once we spent it\nStent edge it's gone so let's talk a little bit about it some ways we can make them most of the time we have left we're talking about time for saving time for planning is that what you mean\nYeah all of those things are and then some and and obviously from a savings standpoint you know one of the ways that we can take advantage of the time that we have\nA is to save as much as we can while we still can you know specifically those who are over the age of fifty right I mean uh the IRS allows us some unique opportunities to catch up on our retirement savings either through our four O. one K. or or IRA plans\nOr where they allow us to actually save more than a those who are under the age of fifty so that's one way to take advantage of the time you have left is to maximize your savings [laughter] um but definitely you know I think it's important that you keep time or in mind you know one of the things we believe in strongly here\nAs retirement planners and as professionals who sold your work on that phase of life is\nYou know you don't wait till you retire to make your investments looked like you're retired and and what I mean by that is that\nAh we actually kind of believe that when you're five years or less definitely three years or less away from retirement it's kind of time to act like you're retired from an ... standpoint\nBecause I'm\nGenerally speaking the closer to retirement we'd get\nGenerally the more conservative we want to be with our investments and so\nYou can't take that high risk all the way up until the day you retire and then make the changes because what happens if we have that you know every few years big stock market pulled back right before you're about to retire that could have a big say in you having to work longer so think of it as kind of like landing an airplane\nHere the closer we get to retirement you know in the lower to the ground we get it needs to be a slow and steady decline versus just day turn a light switch on and off once we get to retirement\nAbsolutely can can you talk about your planning process how you help some line prepare for this is slower dissent\nThis smoother transition rather than as you said just flipping off to switch and letting everything come crashing all around here [laughter] yeah definitely know crashing here uh that you know and and you know what that's\nThat's really what we help families do here at the ... group a are unique process that we use here is called a roadmap for retirement it's an actual written plan\nThat we build for families these days who are nearing or who are already in retirement and essentially Gen our road map for retirement plan covers but we think are the five most important areas in great detail that needs to be addressed and play in foreign retirement things like\nIncome planning you know where's my income going to come from in retirement and how do I maximize it\nAn investment plan how do I make sure I'm getting the most growth on my money in retirement while making sure I don't take on too much risk\nA and then some and we obviously also get into things like tax planning strategies and distribution planning healthcare planning and even estate planning all under the guidance of one written road map and so\nGenerally speaking those who haven't retired yet can get more of a running head start on retirement with planning than those who are already in it but those who are already in it needed just as much if not more than those who aren't even in retirement yet so for those who are listening today and who are interested in getting serious about their retirement or who are looking to put together a plan\nOr specifically done by an independent from who focuses solely on retirement planning than simply pick up the phone and give us a call\nPick up the phone and give us a call today as a matter of fact you and what I'd like to do is uh for the first ten callers today at one eight hundred six for one\nThirty three sixty one oh we're going to give away ten complimentary roadmap for retirement so um we're my team and I will build an actual plan just for you and your family so if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty

birds in the group Brett Brzezinski if you'd like to learn a little bit more about the birds in the group check out the website it's maximize my retirement dot com today we are going through a list of the most valuable assets for retirement and Brett\nLet's talk about Social Security does it really tops the list\nWell I mean it's definitely up there on our most Americans you know it you know for many of us we've worked a long time and very hard all those years I'm sure are to get in to retirement and for most Americans\nNow their largest source of retirement income is Social Security and so a lot of people want to talk about Social Security and Medicare benefits that they've worked long and hard to qualify for\nBut let's start with Social Security you know in in the majority of cases ah the benefits that most people were will receive they come in the form of a monthly paycheck and yes that most likely it's going to cover some but often not all of your income needs and retirement\nBut why Social Security as valuable as because the payments are are set up to last year entire lifetime\nA historically they've also been increased over time to try and an offset the the impact or costs of inflation\nUm although many experts believe that those days could be numbered in terms of continuing to step up those benefits for inflation just because some of the stresses on the Social Security system are starting to show their heads they may need to curb that spending a bit so maybe maybe not a long term\nCost of living adjustments will continue but they're also valuable because they're flexible in what I mean by that is that you have a say in when you want to start collecting them anytime between the ages of sixty two in Seventy and there's different times that makes sense for different families for different reasons so\nUh again these are all reasons I think why Social Security is is a neat or a valuable important asset to tackle for retirement planning\nTalked about the factors that go into that decision for when is the best time to take it\nA sure um well let's start here so the amount that a person is going to get from Social Security over over their lifetime it depends on a lot of different factors but primarily it starts with the just\nIt starts with the decision you make as to when to start collecting them so right now ah for most Americans they can start drawing Social Security as early as age sixty two\nBut if they don't need that income immediately I often advise waiting well beyond that maybe the sixty six sixty seven\nAnd believe it or not in some cases all the way to Seventy if you truly don't need the income\nYou know we talk a lot about how to optimize or um maximize our Social Security benefits and that's one of\nThe many moving parts inside our clients roadmap for retirement plans we build for them it's how to maximize or optimize their Social Security benefits but generally speaking when we talk about\nHow do I get the most money out of Social Security's pockets and into my own\nTypically that requires you to wait for a while maybe often till the age of seventies so that what that does is it increases what are called your retirement credits\nAnd Gen for those who can wait you know just between the ages of sixty six in Seventy alone\nAre Social Security benefits girl by eight percent a year wow yeah since there for sure there's some serious value\nIn waiting now granted we understand not everybody's in a position to wait and then they should take them but if you're not entirely sure how to go about it this is again one of the many things we help families with here in in metro Detroit\nLet me ask you real quickly add now case things like benefits such as Medicare I I think Social Security is certainly a valuable retirement asset how do you approach Medicare decisions with your clients\n[noise] yeah well I mean Medicare is another one of those perks you know the Uncle Sam says that ah any one sixty five or older you know would be wise to try and take advantage of\nAnd again that's to help cover the additional health care and in medical costs that most likely you're going to pay during your retirement mhm\nNow Gen what we talk about is you know things like people who are our age sixty five or older can start claiming Medicare benefits now and those who are younger than sixty five with disabilities can as well\nUh in in Medicare's got a lot of moving parts to it and no pun intended you know let let's say here they have two parts there's what's called ... which is commonly known as a hospital insurance\nNow you're eligible for free\nParty\nYou're at least age sixty five and you or your spouse has worked in paid Medicare taxes for at least ten years so if you were in the workforce paying Medicare taxes like most Americans probably were for at least ten years or you're eligible for this free Medicare party which is again what we refer to as hospital insurance\nOr you can also get part a without having to pay premiums if you meet some other conditions as well which I won't go into today and then the second part is what we refer to as part B which is known as the medical insurance parts of hospital insurance\nAnd then medical insurance and as valuable as\nUh some of the Medicare benefits can be there's also limits as to what they can and can't covered so\nThis is where you want to start focusing in or talking to a benefits coordinator or a benefit specialist or to help you figure out how do I go about building my plan properly that is not something we do here at the ... group but it's something that's still nonetheless should be planned for\n... can you talk about your process for those who realize they don't know when the right time as for Social Security they haven't looked at some of these other benefits they need to be thinking about heading into retirement can you talk about your process for getting started\nYeah absolutely you know at the end of the day\nBut at the end of the day um and first off with the phone number out there the number today is eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one\nBut at the end of the day Gen you know we've been in practice now for over Thirty years at the ... group and all we do is retirement planning\nRight we work with families who are in their young to mid fifties and older get ready for that next phase of life and not only do we help get them ready for it we also help guide them through it um so for those families who are getting close to retirement and probably realize the importance of working with a specialist for the next phase of phase of life\nNow I Hope they'll take us up on our offer today and give us a call if\nIf they're one of the first ten callers today at one eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one they're going to receive their own complimentary road map for retirement where we talk about all sorts of important topics in planning tools for retirement but it starts with their written income plan\nHow do I get the most out of my Social Security benefits where should I invest my four oh one K. and my IRAs to make sure I generate enough income in retirement so that I never run out\nOn and on and on and if you haven't taken the time to build a plan yet for retirement make today the day don't wait any longer so if you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for your retirement\nMake today the day we're getting started pick up the phone and give us a call at one eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one again that's eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one\nYou you know the most valuable assets for you heading into retirement and how to make the most and those assets looking teeny this discussion in just a

retirement Motor City edition generally jak\nHere alongside of Brett was in ... he is president of the present ski group they've been helping people throughout the metro Detroit area with retirements since Nineteen eighty eight\nMaximize my retirement dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more today we'd been identifying your most valuable assets for retirement and certainly brat\nSo many of those guaranteed income sources are going to be very valuable heading into retirement but not guaranteed income sources are pretty valuable to how do we make the most of those\nYeah and and you're right those are just as important from a supplement standpoint and it really non guaranteed income sources would be anything that generates income for us that can fluctuate over time uh or is not guarantee a so things like um\nOur investment portfolios so stocks and bonds mutual funds UPS things that we hold outside our\nRetirement savings accounts as well you know these are assets that you can also used to create an income stream from us so long as you understand that that income can fluctuate or change over time and that's why we try to focus on guaranteed income to cover those bases\nBasic expenses the things that we have to have month in in month out in retirement we want those things is those things to to pour in every month regardless of what's going on on the economy because we have to pay them right mhm but the other things like the vacations the travel the home projects the things that we technically we could live without\nSome families will opt to use the non guaranteed income sources for that because it could change so whether\nIt's getting income via dividends or or interest from a bond\nOr you know even even ATF can generate dividend in interest income you know so\nNow generally the income and interest from these investments um they might be taxable so this is something you're really going to want to take a hard look at which is why again\nTax planning is such a key part of our road map for retirement process here because in retirement every dollar counts and if we're not taking the opportunity to manage taxes in retirement we're really missing the boat we think\nAre and and keeping taxes down simply are crucial\nTo ah to maximizing income soap\nOr another one that that you can do in terms of focusing on non guaranteed income sources would be a using the approach to strategically sell off some of your assets\nInside your investment portfolios so this is figuring out you know when should I sell something and why in order to generate the income but again Gen we always have to make sure we're keeping an eye on taxes I Can't stress that enough\nWhat a cash reserves Vegas that fall into your list of most valuable assets\nYeah it's probably a near the top of the list I mean everybody needs a cash reserve right and what I mean by that is making sure we have a pool of you know readily available cash\nYou know that's that's parked somewhere like a money market account or a CD it's really important for retirees not just to cover an emergency but also for flexibility and and I tell this to our clients all the time\nIf we are used to having to take withdrawals from our stock or bond portfolio\nFor income generally speaking if the markets are falling and or your portfolio is falling\nThat's optimally not a time when we want to also be taking distributions from the account ... so instead of being forced to go into our investment accounts which are currently going through perhaps a of bear market\nWe could let it go down so we can let it come back up and instead goal poll from our cash reserves to supplement our income as well that's that flexibility portion I was talking about at the end of the day you should have the ability to pull in from\nFrom as many different buckets as possible so that you can not only adapt to what's going on in the economy and the stock market but you can also take advantage of different tax laws and opportunities as well\nAnd and let's talk about the different world brat when you're talking about being strategic with taxes impacts planning how is it different working with someone who is helping you with tax planning versus an accountant or a tax preparer\nYeah a great question and and I'm not a CPA I don't do tax prep um but as it pertains to looking at a client's overall financial picture\nThere are years when it makes a lot of sense to spend down from a taxable account\nAnd the next year we may want to take money only out of a a tax free account or a pre tax after there's so many different ways to go about it and especially especially Gen with the new Trump tax laws which are in place until two thousand and twenty five for men\nI've for many of the listeners today they are now when one of if not the lowest tax bracket they have ever been in and so one of the things we do for our clients in our overall roadmap for retirement process is\nFigure out does it make sense for us to actually start withdrawing money from\nOur four O. one K. is or traditional IRAs and paying the tax now on some of that money while all the taxes are as low as they are in preparation of taxes potentially being quite higher when we're later and retirement these are some of the strategic decisions that retirees today are faced with\nAnd quite often we're not getting the state of advice\nFrom a traditional broker somebody who uh helps build a portfolio of mutual funds for us and encourages encourages us to just ride out the storm and don't worry everything's going to be fine they're more suited in our opinion for that thirty or forty year old not necessarily the fifty sixty and Seventy year old\n... can you talk about how your process can help with income planning while also accounting for these other factors tax planning health care inflation so many things are part of your process\nYeah ... you know we refer to them as threats um you know in my job here is to arm the client with as many defense mechanisms as they can get their hands on\nIn preparation of those threats coming their way and retirement so how do we make sure that we don't lose too much money if the stock market crashes so that you don't have to go back to work someday\nHow do we make sure that our income is going to last as long as we do\nHow do we make sure that
