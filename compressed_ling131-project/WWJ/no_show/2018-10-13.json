proving that Saudi journalist in Washington Post writer ... was killed\nWashington Post reports American officials are aware of the audio and video recordings they purportedly show us Saudi security team killing could show inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week where he'd gone to obtain documentation necessary for his upcoming wedding\nWhile the White House seems to be taking a wait and see approach to the investigation some lawmakers on Capitol Hill like Senator Bob Corker Chris Murphy and Cory Gardner are expressing concern\nIf they kill this journalist uh [noise] um [noise]\nUh the relationship will be severely altered um animal changed much of a dynamic candlelight as to how one about things in the middle east\nExtraordinary case of us resident and kidnapped is likely murdered by a U.S ally of President Trump's unwillingness to set out any consequences or even the threat of consequences essentially tells the Saudis says that the war okay\nWith this kind of conduct and behavior\nI I think it's pretty blurring red lines that were about seats\nToday I'm taking some pressure off of\nThe kingdom and Saudi Arabia and saying that if even if they didn't do this we're still going to continue doing business with them a senators on the health things that they shouldn't be a reason to stop those a commitment so we have made to Saudi Arabia it's a hundred and ten\nBillion dollars that the Saudis are buying in terms of US military equipment so that is a lot of money and the president is arguing listen I don't want to jeopardize the business that's happening between the U.S companies and Saudi Arabia\nBecause other countries are going to come in and fill that void like China\nAnd Russia but at this point the question as well if it is proven that Saudi Arabia\nIs twofold did actually murder Jamal ... shouldn't vis a commitment this military agreement this sale a be in jeopardy and that's what senators are arguing but the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House is approaching because she'll be curious compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a disconnect um in terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence and as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have both video and audio of this murder happening\nBut the U.S does not yet a claim that they believe that that is the case they haven't seen everything lined up\nThat completely proves the allegations that the Turks are making here so yesterday the state department said whoa whoa whoa let's not get ahead of ourselves let's not let all these rumors dominate the conversation\nBefore we talk about the repercussions that the Saudis will potentially see\nOn the other side of the coin you have senators on the health saying let's put the threats out there a head\nOf what we know happened so that the Saudis know that they can't do this that they can't kill journalists to say bad things about the leadership and Saudi Arabia and get away with it saved two different kinds of tactics\nHere and we're going to have to see if the White House um get the head and starts putting out any threats before a conclusion is come to in this investigation\nOf CBS News State Department reporter currently outward there's reaction to this from virgins sir Richard Branson who says he uses spreading parts of his business with the Saudi kingdom as the investigation into the disappearance of the show continues\nYou're listening to the CBS News weekend round up Supreme Court associate justice Brett Kavanaugh hurt his first cases this week on the high court after a bruising confirmation battle that his lip anger and resentment boiling on all sides on this week's edition of the takeout part just\nCBS News the White House correspondent major Garrett sat down with Republican senator Joni Ernst ... voted in favor of cabinet all\nBut I Do think that judge Kavanaugh was eminently qualified I did support him in my vote I also do believe that Dr Ford did experience some sort of trauma in her lifetime\nUm I don't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh that perpetrated a that that intimate crime against or that I think she was outed um she wished to remain anonymous\nAnd unfortunately she was outed and she face those same threats against her who\nDo you blame for this job\nI work I Do blame the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or just income\nI think it was the sink Cavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an animal ... aside and they threw or to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to think that Kavanaugh nomination\nDue to strike you as a reluctant witness once you do to us for ...\nAnd I think by doing that I think they hope to think that Kavanaugh's nomination\nOf judge you strike you as a reluctant witness what she did testify under oath in public\nNo she did not seem to be reluctant that by that point she had already been outed and I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement\nI'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard as I've been adamant about that for years I did work with sexual assault survivors back in college so this has been a long standing issue for\nSo let's take a pause give my audience a bit of your ... important to you it's important discoveries version\nYeah absolutely so going back to my days at Iowa State university um it was just a a personal decision of mine to volunteer at a women's crisis shelter and I worked\nThe crisis hotline as well as carried a beeper as a responder for those women that had been either physically abused and domestic situations or those that had been\nA intimately violent violently sexually abused so I Would do calls to women at the jail um sometimes they would\nRetaliate against their abusers um I get calls at the hospital if they were doing rape kits\nUm I get calls on the crisis line I Would respond to go with women to pick up groceries or you know mundane things and things even so it it's a very important topic to me to make sure that uh women and children are protected and sometimes those survivors were men as well\nSo we go to experience what was your own emotional reaction\nAnd what did you see or did not see a doctor forge testimony that reminded you of what you actually experience and those coach\nThere well I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of corroboration from the witnesses that she identified and so when they came forward and in their statements basically said you know what this didn't happen or there was no such party [noise]\nUm it it hurt her credibility\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa was CBS was major Garrett on his superb podcast the takeout coming up easy takes it to the house the White House if you don't

J. news times seven forty\nOn the CBS News weekend round up I'm don't break off earlier in the program we talked with State Department reporter ... what about the latest in the ... case but I wanted to bring her back to talk about on assignment of a lifetime she just finished up\nShe was the only American reporter to cover secretary of state Mike Pompeo's trip to North Korea this past week\nOn assignment of a lifetime should just finished up she was the only American reporter to cover secretary of state Mike Pompeo's trip to North Korea this past week and it was your first time in country collie can you give us what your first impression was\nWell people will say um that it's eerie on the grounds there that you don't see you know many cars many people um that felt even more true when I was there\nA as we drove from the airport um to a guest house where uh they kept us kind of cooped up waiting for these Kim Jong un meetings to um take place\nI thought maybe three cars on that twenty minute drive\nA we saw a few people walking the streets\nI'm it all felt very curated what we were actually seeing there were a few women on riding bicycles um but they weren't you know they didn't have their eyes set on us even though we were this large motorcade that was driving through uh the country and\nI Would assume a non traditional site for them but they they were very clear not to not to check us out too closely and when we landed\nA the shocking thing to me was that secretary of state Pompeo was thrown immediately I'm into a pretty awkward situation with his North Korean counterpart because his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong il who Pompeo has met many times now\nI'm immediately told him that he couldn't bring his translator or his armed body man into his meeting with Kim Jong on you know dictating the terms of that meeting and putting the secretary of state on his heels a little bit because obviously\nThis meeting with Kim Jong none was why he came last time that he went to North Korea he was denied that meeting and it it didn't look so good for him\nSo what ultimately happened the remote going without a translator wind blowing\nYou know they've gotten to the motorcade I watch them all get into the motorcade yeah secretary of state Mike Pompeo a U.S special representative to North Korea Steve began gotten one car and then behind them was the CIA director of the Korean mission Andy Kim and the U.S translator\nUm and so they sat in their cars you know all prepared ready to head off to this a meeting that everyone was anticipating and then they sat there\nFor about five minutes but it felt like a lifetime because North Koreans were running around and kind of whispering to one another and\nI'm us Secret Service personnel were giving each other I'm nervous glances as to what the hell is going on here and then they went to the secretary's car a had a discussion that I could not here\nI'm from where I was standing and um right after that the u._s. translator was got out of the car behind them and didn't go to the meeting\nNow I Want to point out that indeed Kim\nWho is the CIA mission I'm director of Korea he speaks fluent Korean I mean I saw him interacting with the north Korean throughout the time there he's very comfortable so he was in the meeting it wasn't as if\nThey were just taking Kim Jong un's translators word for what was happening um and Pompeo did go with his Secret Service detail\nBut you know that conversation on the runway wasn't forgotten by North Korea say they hold us accountable um to what are their standards and their rules\nWhen the U. S. is on the ground in Pyongyang and it was very evident um in that moment that they were controlling what was happening the narrative and uh the logistics\nAnd yet at the end of it Pompeo comes out saying we're farther down the road we're ...\nBowling Lois happening the narrative and uh the logistics\nAnd yet at the end of it ... comes out saying we're farther down the road we have some ground for potential second summit between the president and and chairman Kim so obviously they feel like a they made some garbage on this\nThey did make some yard edge in terms of continuing us North Korea discussions on at the end of August a beginning of September ... trip to North Korea was canceled\nWe thought that it looks like the two countries weren't really interacting anymore well now at least discussion seemed to be back on track\n'em and North Korea did agree a pump has had to allow some inspectors into one of their nuclear test launch sites\nBut in terms of what we tend to really change about North Korea's nuclear capability and it's highly developed nuclear program nothing\nCBS is highly Atwood thank you this week a judge in New York threw out some of the charges against disgraced Hollywood mobile Harvey Weinstein WCBS reporter Marla diamond has more\nEvans grand jury testimony was contradicted by emails that suggested her two thousand and four sexual encounter with white steam was consensual the district attorney is still going ahead with the cases of the two other accusers defense attorney Ben Brafman\nWe are pleased with this of elements the case is not over but I think it is a permanently and director of building a damaged\nAttorney Carrie Goldberg spoke to reporters on ... behalf saying the da's decision to drop the case does not invalidate the true it\nDoes which is really a need for for\nMarley diamond for CBS News New York\nAnd now perhaps as a public service award or two about disagreeing civilly you're CBS this morning co hosts John Dickerson with his reporter's notebook\nI Would like to have an argument by which I mean I Would like to enjoy having an argument a brisk exchange of views where participants are in live in didn't learn something it is still possible there are pockets of small tribes that still engage in this behavior\nSo it does feel very rare passes for argument today or the shared off exchanges in social media and the vinegar\nThat is spoon back and forth on cable news Supreme Court depends on good arguments though the hearing to pick up the next member opened with what felt like a group drowning\nYou'll have access to it not so good eighty percent\nMotives were questioned and serious issues were responded to with loud talking\nOr warm welcome Nazi or David Letterman on friday when\nQuestions were asked the key to any good arguments\nThe nominee offered the usual peek a boo responses we pick judges who are to rule on the quality of arguments through a process where quality arguments are smothered bad arguments in danger of polarized nation you can't understand why a person Neal's at an NFL game or understand why that offends someone\nUnless you know how to argue and without understanding you have conflict a new book by Greg loopy on often Jonathan height identifies the stakes unless we learn to argue better we will grow dumber be less happy and become a nation of grudge shoulders\nSo how do you have an argument treat others like human beings have a generous interpretation of their views allowed them to clarify before shaming them don't judge their motive\nOr judge them by the group there and if you are religious follow the first tenant of every major religion treat others the way you would like to be treated this leads to understanding and\nSo the first tenant of every major religious treat others the way you would like to be treated this leads to understanding and if that doesn't happen no one gets sore and reaches for the fireplace poker to settle things\nAbove all practice humility follow the maximum when arguing with a fool make sure they're not doing the same thing\nComing up next a preview of this week's forty eight hours and celebrating fifty years of Led Zeppelin of CBS News weekend round up [noise]\n[noise]\nTraffic and whether it together W.
