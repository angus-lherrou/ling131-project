are prohibited from having guns under federal law\nAnd it's to target these people to make sure that our streets are safer just see that we can get them to the justice system and the other aspect of this is working together as a team so the federal state and local law enforcement partners are all working together\nNow what happened over the years though it kind of lost steam\nAnd so last year one year ago this week attorney general Jeff Sessions decided to reinvigorate project safe neighborhoods it's really a project safe neighborhoods to point zero\nAnd the Justice Department as putting more

that we're we're going after criminals more effectively and we're keeping the streets are a bit safer than we were a year ago\nSo talk to me a little bit about in terms of like in communities and in neighborhoods um 'cause I understand even from hiring standpoint is helping but in terms of like the neighborhoods and things what could we potentially see there as well because of the additional funding\nWell our partners with the Detroit police department and our federal and local partners you'll see that will be out more aggressively we are continuing to work directly with\nThe community by going out to a member of meetings for example with our project a ceasefire\nThat the mayor and the chief of police ah she'd Cregor working on and we're going to be continuing to be actively engaged to
