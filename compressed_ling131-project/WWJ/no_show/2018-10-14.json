B. reporter Geoff Gilmore [noise]\nWe've set the table by talking about some of the products that were introduced to the ... show and coming up we're going to take a look at some of the big behind the scenes and also one of the biggest\nChanges you're seeing in Europe electrification but now let's look at all those shows in general for years the Paris auto show had a special niche on the circuit Kelley Blue book catalyst Karl Brauer\nParis has kind of maybe the most just kind of straightforward auto show a it's relatively large but it's certainly very accessible in terms of what it presents a and it's in a city that's of course beautiful and people like to visit\nBut there were many vehicle brands that decided not to visit Paris this year\nFor the snow a Mitsubishi there's no I'm open to leave the European so we are continuing see a trend away from all to show Alister\nWaver as with Edmunds dot com Stephanie ... is what I just markets\nAutomakers has a much broader audience as platforms with which to introduce new vehicles and Saturday on a show is no longer quite the default that it used to\nIf you don't have sort of big splash if you don't have had a product that's going to try that much attention isn't worth that cost this is the second time in a row that Ford is passed on Paris for president of operations Joe Hendricks says they have to prioritize where they want to be\nI I think that's true for a lot number of the auto show there are some that you know we'll probably always be at given the markets and yeah and our home base on but you do have to make choices about where are you how you want to\nMake announcements how you want to show up where you want to spend your money and um depending on what show it is it has different returns and and we're in like you said\nThere may be better ways of communicating a new product or a new initiative that an auto show given all the other noise in there and that but you know our team did a great job evaluating those priorities and ... and I wouldn't say there's a definitive answer one way or the other but it is it is about making choices and we see more of that going forward\nNow they're showing Detroit's getting out in front of this by moving through June in twenty twenty and most of the people who have been coming to Detroit in January for the auto show up and complaining about asking for the move for a while but not Alister Weaver for madman\nNobody will one of the few people out she enjoys Detroit January but I thought that was the rituals started the year it was the opportunity to connect with the industry who's up who's down look at all the new models\nAnd interesting opinion but not necessarily in the majority that are towards germs executive director rod Albert was that the parish show surveying the sentiment of manufacturers and the sentiment about the move is generally been positive\nIt's really the trend of what people are looking forward to these days not so much of the static its place in our side by side you need that but everybody is so excited they are wanting to participate in any way they can to make this a ... a big new great event Detroit and really short Detroit in a month when we can put down candidates are in his best foot forward duck\nNor will be chair of the first summer showing twenty twenty now Audi Mercedes and BMW won't be at the twenty ninth team showing January north has been talking with him in Paris so will they come back for the first summer show\nWe've certainly maintained our communication with them and they virtually all like the idea of the move to June\nThey've not than in any way yes committal and what their future plans are but they're watching with great anticipation hand of course they're very interested in outdoor opportunities so we're hopeful that we'll get you know favorable response from them and that is\nNot in twenty twenty of them maybe in twenty Twenty one or something to that effect\nOf being the share of they essentially revolted showed is that kind of like jumping in the pool at the deep end\nWell as as a someone said to me recently you're going to be famous one way or the other you're going to sink or swim but no we're\nWe're excited because we're really trying to take what's best that our show right now add to it and make it better than we are doing it at a time of year when people are really excited to be outside in downtown and so I don't really think there's a way to lose here\nDon't focus so much on who is in and who is out so that limb see automotive analyst Jeff Schuster he says car companies picking and choosing their auto shows is going to become the new normal I think\nThis really is the the continuation of the phenomenon that we're seeing kind of around the world as it relates to auto shows are having a difficult time getting all brands and all makes their regardless of of how much volume in size they have\nAnd the mission of auto shows evolving as well according to Kelley Blue book smack the Lorenzo\nYou know the industry used to use shows to reach the public\nReach the media and talk to each other\nAnd it seems like the media and talking to each other isn't a big part of the agenda anymore\nWhy is the word on this subject did Doug north who will be running that very important June of twenty twenty auto show you were in Detroit the plants aren't complete yet but if you're going be prepared to do something you haven't been able to do in January look at and experience vehicles outside\nWe will have fourteen acres outside of hobo which will basically\nMove people will move back and forth from inside outside so we really have a great amount of space with hard plaza and we're really excited about creating that kind of environment that you

Hoagy shouldn't vis a commitment this military agreement this sale a be in jeopardy and that's what senators are arguing but the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House who's approaching the crucial because compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a disconnect um\nIn terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence and as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have both video and audio of this murder happening\nBut the U.S does not yet a claim that they believe that that is the case they haven't seen everything lined up\nThat completely proves the allegations that the Turks are making here so yesterday the state department said whoa whoa whoa let's not get ahead of ourselves let's not let all these rumors dominate the conversation\nBefore we talk about the repercussions that the Saudis will potentially see on the other side of the coin you have senators on the health saying let's put the threats out there a head\nOf what we know happened so that the Saudis know that they can't do this that they can't kill journalist who say bad things about the leadership in Saudi Arabia and get away with it saved two different kinds of tactics\nHere and we're going to have to see if the White House and get the head and starts putting out any threats before a conclusion has come to in this investigation\nOf CBS

motivation was to help her or just income\nI think it was the sink Cavanaugh I think they\nHaving a I think they put her feelings of an animal ... aside and they threw or to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to sing the Kavanaugh nomination\nDid you strike you as a reluctant witness once she did testify under oath and public\nNo she did not seem to be reluctant to hide that point she had already been outed and I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement\nI'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard as I've been adamant about that for years I did work with sexual assault a survivors back in college so this has been a long standing issue for\nSo look sick pause give my audience a bit of your ... important to you what's important discovery sushi\nYeah absolutely so going back to my days at Iowa State university um it was just a a personal decision of mine to volunteer at a women's Chrysler shelter and I worked\nThe crisis hotline as well as carried a beeper as a responder for those women that has been either physically abused and domestic situations or those that had been\nA intimately violent violently sexually abused so I Would do calls to women at the jail um sometimes they would\nRetaliate against their abusers um I get calls at the hospital if they were doing rape kits\nUm I get calls on the crisis line I Would respond to go with women to pick up groceries mundane things and things even so it it's a very important topic to me to make sure that uh women and children are protected and sometimes those survivors were men as well\nSo we go to experience what was your own emotional reaction\nAnd what did you see or did not see a doctor ... testimony that reminded you of what you actually experiencing those crowds\nThere well I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of cooperation from the witnesses said she identified and so when they came forward and in their statements basically said you know what this didn't happen or there was no such party\nUm it it hurt her credibility\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa was CBS has major Garrett on his superb podcast the takeout coming up easy to answer to the

many who said the president isn't helping\nWe talked with the president about that the contentious Kavanaugh hearings questions of chaos and his administration and his record so far\nSo you've been president for almost two years is there anything that you wish you hadn't said anything you wish you hadn't done do you have any regrets so when I Won the presidency I saw a suppressed reach me there

what you regret\nI regret that the press Christmas show on a daily asking despite that my bowl numbers are very good had made any mistakes that's my question everybody makes mistakes and what had been yours I could have been a earlier with\nTerminating the NAFTA deal the problem was I was getting to know the leaders I was getting to know countries I didn't want to do it right out of the books\nSo I waited a little while but I could have done trade a little bit earlier what about the forest separation of children from their migrant children from the same as the Obama law you know Obama had the same time it was on the books but he didn't enforce that new one for us that were launched that pop the zero tolerance policy\nBe to deter families with children and then everybody decided and the

look at uh making deals with other countries\nNobody's been able to do anything like this actually most people didn't even try because they knew that didn't have the ability to do it but it's a very deceptive world the other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound but\nI Know I I never knew how to change the subject to get well no but even the way you ask me a question like about separation yeah\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about how I when I was affected by going around your answer but you did
