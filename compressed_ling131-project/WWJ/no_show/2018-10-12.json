newsworthy\nDoubling up to News I'm one forty one Harvard researcher Todd Rose now working to change how we think about success he co wrote the new book called dark horse achieving success through the pursuit of fulfillment you talked about his findings on CBS this morning\nI think that for most of us when we think about success is pretty narrow um and we end up being about things like well status power um and we sort of think that you have to choose between that and being happy and dark horse shows that you actually don't have to chew\nAnd when you have to do if you're a dark horse what do you what what is at the center of your life the secret is um prioritizing personal fulfillment over more conventional notions of success if that's the case and I'm just coming up in the world what's the difference between a prioritizing personal fulfillment and just being flaky\nUm we founded our research it's about picking personal responsibility for your choices\nRight so all the men and women we studied they never shirk responsibility they\nAlways were willing to sacrifice for fulfillment um and I think as a parent I often think about this from my own kids ask that question um you know they want to be an actor and they're living in Hollywood with a roommate and you know working two jobs that responsibility they want me to fund\nTheir life that you were thinking okay maybe this isn't going to work out for you this Hollywood during but I like when you said in your book these dark horses are ignored until they get success and then they're called inspiring right and you were a dark horse you're twenty you're you dropped out of out of college you didn't and then you had two kids by the age of twenty and the the people are looking at going I don't know that Todd\nYeah no I was pretty well off of that um we relied on welfare to pick her my two kids\nIs actually my dad who gave me this piece of advice that changed everything he said if I wanted something better I had to figure out what really motivated me and I had to stay close to that um and that advice changed my path completely amid let me get a GED go to college that eventually end up at Harvard where I get to study what makes people pick\nAnd you're right about the game of judgment that helps people find their ... what is that you know it's just\nA simple way to figure out you know what motivates you let me give you the the short version here I'm thinking about the things that you enjoy doing and ask yourself why right so if you enjoy football is it the competition is it being outdoors is that the camaraderie that comes with team sport\nUm the more you think about those things in the more you know what really moves you and if you ask yourself that question off enough they will reveal your broader motives and that will put you on a path to fulfillment\nAnd you say no such thing as one size fits all fulfillment which I thought was an interesting concept\nWe can build systems allow everyone to be successful and happy\nSpeaking in building those systems how do you do this in upscale way rather than just\nPerson by person you know what I think Twenty years ago it would have been really hard to do now if you take somebody like education we absolutely can personalize that we can take our kids individuality fiercely um which I find sort of odd that we figured out how to personal I almost all other aspects of our life but when it comes to our kids' education\nOr Shockley sort of okay with the status quo but we shouldn't be\nThat's Harvard researcher Todd Rose talking about his

pursuit of fulfillment you talked about his findings on CBS this morning\nI think that for most of us when we think about success is pretty narrow um and we end up paying about things like well status power um and we sort of think that you have to choose between that and being happy and dark horse shows that you actually don't have to do\nAnd what do you have to do if you're a dark horse what do you what what is at the center of your life the secret is um prioritizing personal fulfillment over more conventional notions of success if that's the case and I'm just coming up in the world what's the difference between a prioritizing personal fulfillment and just being flaky\nUm we found in our research it's about picking personal responsibility for your choices\nRight so all the men and women we studied they never shirk responsibility they\nAlways were willing to sacrifice for fulfillment um and I think as a parent I often think about this from my own kids ask that question um you know they want to be an actor and they're living in Hollywood with a roommate and you know working two jobs that responsibility they want me to find their\nLife that you were thinking okay maybe this isn't going to work out for you this Hollywood during but I like when you said in your book these dark courses are ignored until they get success and then they're called inspiring right and you were a dark horse you're twenty dropped out of out of college you didn't and then you had two kids by the age of twenty ... that people are looking at going I don't know that\nTodd yeah no I was pretty well off that um we relied on welfare to take care of my two kids um it was actually my dad gave me this piece of advice that changed everything he said if I wanted something better I had to figure out what really motivated me and I had to stay close to that um and that advice changed my path completely\nOn that let me get a GED go to college and eventually end up at Harvard or I get to study what makes people pick\nAnd you're right about the game of judgment and help people find their motivation what is that you know it's just a\nSimple way to figure out you know what motivates you let me give you the the short version here I'm thinking about the things that you enjoy doing and ask yourself why right and so if you enjoy football is it the competition is it being outdoors is the camaraderie that comes with team sport\nUm the more you think about the things the more you know what really moves you and if you ask yourself that question off enough that will reveal your brother\nSize fits all fulfillment which I thought was an interesting concept\nYeah no look we we've tried that right now everybody's different and as soon as we started appreciating that we can build systems allow everyone to be successful and happy\nSpeaking in building those systems how do you do this in an upscale way other than just\nPerson by person you know what I think Twenty years ago it would have been really hard to do now if you take somebody like education we absolutely can personalize it right we can take our kids individuality seriously um which I find sort of odd that we figured out how to personal I almost all other aspects of our lives but when it comes to our kids' education\nOr Shockley sort of okay with the status quo but we shouldn't be\nAbout Harvard researcher Todd roast talking about his
