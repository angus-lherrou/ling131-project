inside retirement Motor City addition I in general jak pleased to be here once again alongside Brett Brzezinski bread is president and the birds in the group which has been help\nAnd I am generally jak pleased to be here once again alongside of Brett ...\nBread is president and the birds in the group which has been helping people throughout the metro Detroit area with retirements since Nineteen eighty eight\nBefore we get started in the show today if you'd like to learn a little bit more we'd encourage you to check out the website it's maximize my retirement dot com so today we're going to be talking about what is so many of you have done the hard work of saving for retirement\nNow comes the challenge of protecting those assets from all the what ifs of the financial world inflation taxes\nHealth care of these are things out of your control and they can do a number on your finances if left unaccounted for so today we're going to take those what if we're going to pair them with some effective approaches for addressing then so that is that what if does come to pass at some point you are prepared so\nBrett let's go ahead and get started on some of these what ifs which I imagine you hear some of them is thrown at us as questions in your op ed in each and every week what if I get into retirement brat and interest rates start to rise\nYeah you know Jim this is one of my favorite topics in believe it or not um I don't necessarily get\nLot of questions about what if these things happen so we tend to find ourselves asking the client these questions what if interest rates rise do you have a plan for that\nAnd so on and so forth so oftentimes families I don't think of thought through all of the complexities of the what ifs and retirement and uh so we can hopefully shut the light on that as we go today about here are some of the things that you better thing can talk about your advisor\nJust in case what if they happen right\nRight exactly well go ahead and start with I I picked this what if of interest rate starting to rise at how does this affect us in what can we do to protect ourselves if this is some sort of concern\nYeah absolutely well kind of be the general rule of thumb we we understand about interest rates when they start to rise is it's the risk of bond prices moving in the opposite direction I'm\nSo generally as rates go up bond prices go down and and bombs that are are tied to longer maturity or order rations\nThey're even more price sensitive so essentially in a rising rate environment which we've started to enter now in our country again and many professionals think\nOr predict that will continue for some time typically a ten year bond could lose you know more than ...\nA more value than let's just say a short term two year ban so we have to be really careful about you know investing their money in these long term bonds during rising interest rates because there is a negative correlation there you know on on the flip side Gen if if we're investing in equities the effect or the impact is not as direct\nYou know but essentially when we have rising rates that means borrowing money becomes more expensive so\nThe costs to do business goes up\nWhich obviously can impact cash flows and the bottom line and and so on and so forth\nI mean loans like mortgages and in student loans and car loans and you know credit cards all of those things are going to need to have higher interest rates tied to them making it more expensive to pay them back so yeah what happens if interest rates rise well\nThere's some things that are going to negatively be impacted\nSure sure so if we are trying to make sure we are diversified so everything in our portfolio isn't moving all in one direction ... tell me what that ideal mix might look like\nYou I mean I think I think you got to protect against this stuff\nOne direction ... tell me what that ideal next might look like\nYeah I mean I think I think you got to protect against this stuff in retirement especially and so typically I'll recommend maintaining a a diversified portfolio you know a mixture of stocks and bonds cash\nAnd even other financial instruments that are all in tune with your specific risk profile you know\nBy mixing things up appropriately we make sure that everything is now moving in one direction or the other uh in in essentially you know we really diversify these assets across a lot of different areas and asset classes\nSo that if the markets go up not all of our money goes up at the same time and if markets go down not all of our money goes down at the same time we don't want all of our things to be correlated or moving in unison so we protect against some of these things like rising interest rates by diversifying our assets and do a lot

your process then just addressing what might happen with interest rates can you tell me a little bit about it\nYeah I certainly can and ... I Know you're a sports fan you and I talk sports a lot or are you familiar with the phrase um in sports that defense wins championships\nI've heard that right now\nTo answer wins championships so they say a lot of times in sports\nYou know whether you're a basketball team or a football team often times it's the better team defense that will win the game not necessarily to better teams often and so\nIn retirement planning which is where you know we spent all of our time and effort and energy at the urgency group we focus on defense you know meeting making sure that your portfolio\nIs ready to handle is many of the what ifs that could possibly come your way in retirement as possible\nYou know during your working years you know your thirties or forties maybe your early fifties you're on often you know which trying to time to score as many points as we possibly can accumulate as much money as we possibly can long term growth investments in the market but retirements a little different\nThere's only one retirement and you get into making sure that you're protecting that nest egg against all of these what ifs well that's more important than trying to make a bunch of money at all costs and so\nHow we focus that in for our clients is we have a unique process Jen that we refer to as our road map for retirement\nSo what we do here at the ... group as we sit down with families and we helped educate and build for them their own custom plan or roadmap as to how to navigate all of the nuances the intricacies the threats that might exist for them in retirement\nAnd before those things come knocking on their door when they're in their sixties seventies eighties or nineties\nWe tried to make sure they've already got some plans or some defense mechanisms inside their financial plan to protect themselves from those things and because all we do here is retirement focus planning\nWell we we think we do a pretty good job at it after Thirty years and so today Jen what I Would like to do is as always I Want to helping educate as many families here in metro Detroit as possible\nFor the first ten callers on the today show at one eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one we'd like to build for them their own custom complimentary roadmap for retirement so\nIf you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for your retirement\nAnd you're ready to get serious about it and you're looking for that plan or that guy you want to work with that local expert\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for your retirement and you're ready to get serious about it and you're looking for that plan or that guy you want to work with the local expert who was that specifically geared towards helping you in retirement than be one of the first time caller and let's get started or number today is one eight hundred six for one\nThirty three sixty one\nHow to handle retirements biggest what is that to our topic today so what if inflation has a significant increase wrestling to answer that question after the break we'll be back after this\nCyber trafficking whether together on the [noise]\nChecking those AAA jam still following an accident in Detroit eastbound die Ninety four mount Eliot\nThe ride children right leaning affected by that crashed as he was a little extra caution is beginning to slightly and proven that area backups are now are just near Shane they're just starting to get much better as we speak so just use a little caution when you're traveling in that area it's east bound by Ninety four at Mount Elliott\nEastbound six Ninety six between or too late to American Dr will have only two lanes open and only one lane to us twenty four telegraph open this weekend whether affecting concrete expect am backups on six Ninety six I Ninety six and five and two Seventy five and ... reports try using us twenty three\nI two Seventy five in fourteen grand river as alternate routes but once again it's going to be east bound six Ninety six ... two American drive only two lane suspected open a due to weather\nFrom the idol download a group twenty four hour traffic center I'm tia Graham WW Jay news radio nine fifty\nAccuweather forecast meteorologist John ... the family's heating cooling Andy electrical weather center\nPartly cloudy and chili for tonight down to thirty five in the city upper twenties and some suburbs that are all the clouds of sunshine for tomorrow I fifty five partly cloudy to modernize low thirty nine and Tuesday clouds and some sunshine I fifty two\nWednesday chilies sunshine Apache clouds I'd forty nine Thursday partly sunny chili again up to forty nine this is at you with everybody around we'll just John fear it could be W.

us today this is inside retirement Motor City edition I'm generally jak I'm here today with the president of the birds in the group Brett ... if you'd like to learn a little bit more you can visit maximize my retirement dot com Brett\nThis is the big what s I think a lot of people are asking about these days what if the market drops as I'm heading into retirement\nYeah it's a big one a especially after ten years right on the market going up up up um you know obviously Gen dramatic drops are sure to make the headlines but remember market corrections their normal and in there to be expected even if we haven't had one in quite some time\nYou know and if you haven't hit retirement yet you know I I Do recommend that you maintain your long term view of riding it out but\nIf you're within five years of retirement\nOr into retirement it's time to act like you're retired with your money and that's where you know making sure we eliminate the big losses by not exposing our investments to too much risk\nThat's really really important that's how we can help avoid you know participating in these big drops are these big stock market losses so I Know it's easier said than done\nBut for those who are ways away from retirement still you know you generally are better off riding it out when markets go down but for those who are in or near retirement it's about protecting the assets before the market goes down\nThat ... what about the panic that tends to happen when they're all these headlines and we start to get a little bit emotional a little bit worried about what we're reading and all these notifications were getting on our phones to an all of that out so we aren't overreacting\nYeah that's and it's so hard to do that with anything in life especially when it comes to our money\nYou know I think how how we recommend doing it is setting the proper expectation and having the proper understanding\nWith your financial advisor in advance as to how your investments might perform in the event of good but more importantly bad news and our markets you know so many families I've had the chance to meet over the years\nIn the event of good but more importantly bad news and our markets you\nKnow so many families I've had the chance to meet over the years they\nReally don't know how much risk or growth opportunity they're exposing their investments to and their portfolio until the markets do one thing or another and and we think that that's kind of where a lot of the anxiety stems from if I have an investment portfolio and I have no idea\nWhat it might do if the market goes down severely that's something that I'm always going to have anxiety about you know we have a service here that's part of our road map for retirement process that we refer to Gen ... is our portfolio stress test mhm a\nPortfolio stress tests where we will actually take a family's portfolio and we will run it through a variety of potential stressful events um think of it as like a hypothetical simulation\nYes you can well yeah that's a little bit right exactly right let's see how this\nThing's going to perform in good times but more importantly in bad times and what that does is it allows the client to have a good clear understanding\nOf which direction their investments are going to head when markets move and so if I knew ahead of time that the most I could lose on my investments with let's say ten or Fifteen Percent and I was comfortable with that\nAnd I hear that the markets crashing and all of those things well I'm less likely to make those knee jerk reactions which can harm my overall success if me and my advisor around the same page from the start so I think education is big and for our listeners today who are going to want to call in and get their own road map for retirement\nThat portfolio stress test really as a valuable tool that we offer to not not only understand the risk for taking on and how our investments might move in advance\nBut for a lot of people who I Know are curious it also uncovers the cost of investing in those hidden fees so again portfolio stress test Jen is something that we're happy to do is part of our road map for retirement process\nBrad what do you say that stress test is pretty eye opening for a lot of people who come in ...\nMore times than not for sure you know so many people don't know how much they pay their advisor or um you know are they being charged a lot of hidden fees or something we referred to as loads are commissions and our portfolio stress tested it pulls back the curtain\nOn your investment pro portfolio from your brokerage account all those difficult questions so many people have have trouble asking directly to their advisors or we can answer for them how much am I paying he or she and\nIs it worth it am I getting value for the the fees I'm paying and yes fees are important and it's something we harp on here every day about keeping them low in retirement\nBut really Jen this portfolio stress test is designed to show families\nPotentially they are exposing their money to way too much risk at this stage in their life\nUnknowingly so if one family at a time that are either retired or getting close to it if I can help educate them\nOn the importance of getting some of their chips off the table and starting to build some walls around some of their their savings to make sure that they don't give them all back when this market finally go south again well that's my that's my main objective is to preserve one retirement at a time so\nFor those out there who are listening and and think that maybe it is time to get more conservative but your broker or your advisor just doesn't really want to hear it give us a call we'll give you that on a second opinion will run you a portfolio stress test in ...\nJust doesn't really want to hear it give us a call we'll give you that on a second opinion will run you will portfolio stress test and for those who want it\nWill will build for you your own customized a roadmap for retirement that help shed light or give you a map and in in a path to follow year in and year out throughout your retirement it's it's really something that so many of our our clients here in metro Detroit get so much value out of\nHow do we get started if this stress test and the roadmap for retirement is something we think might benefit our family\nYeah I mean it's really for that family or individual who is you know nearing retirement generally five to seven years away or less or who are already retired those families who understand that you know what there's a lot of nuances and and threats that exist in retirement\nThat I may not understand or I may not have a plan for yet\nThings like Social Security planning and pensions and inflation in tax strategies healthcare long term care estate planning these are all of the areas that we talk to our clients about here day in and day out\nAnd so for those families who think they fall into a category like that that they want that retirement focused advice right someone who's walked down the mountain of retirement thousands of times of families that to this is for Gen so if you're one of those families and you have saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for your retirement\nMake today the day that you're going to get the ball rolling on getting set up properly for retirement so give us a call at one eight hundred six for one thirty three sixty one if you're one of the first ten callers my team and I will build for you your own custom\nComplimentary roadmap for retirement which again includes that portfolio stress test again that number for the first ten callers today is one eight hundred six for

J. news time nine forty\nThink for sticking around today this is an inside retirement Motor City edition I'm generally jak\nAlongside ... he's president of the ... group today we're talking about how to handle retirements biggest what s brat we cannot just assume that nothing will go wrong as we get into your retirement you and I we both have children and we know anything can happen\nThat's not going to change in retirement what if I get sick or what if my husband gets sick how do you plan for that\nYeah we all know you know ...\nThat's not going to change in retirement what if I get sick or what if my husband gets sick how do you plan for that\nYeah we all know you know Gen ... the chance of getting sick as we get older rises uh and and we know that the price of health care can be high uh you know in fact I read medical bills\nAre the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United states oh wow you know so making sure you have a proper healthcare plan for retirement or typically I recommend in what I call a three pronged approach\nAh so we want to use a Medicare obviously number one ah an H. S. A. and that stands for health savings account that's your own contributions towards healthcare\nA third is long term care um that that three three pronged approach we think is a good a good position to do our best to protect against it now first off let me address the age essay or the health savings account\nIt's for consumers who have high deductible health plans and it gives them a tax break for out of pocket medical expenses so from attacks perspective you know H essays or a no brainer you know the contributions you put into them or tax deductible or money that you save into an age essay\nOr can grow tax deferred or in for a family at sixty nine hundred dollars a year you can put in right now in twenty Eighteen\nA third account holders are able to withdraw funds tax free as long as they cover qualified medical costs so um you know now but here's something that you need to know once you or your spouse enroll in Medicare\nYou no longer can contribute to an age essays so planning ahead is really the key in this instance here\nCan you talk real quickly about how Medicare does fit into all of your planning there with the Brzezinski group\n[noise] yeah I mean we don't per se roll up our sleeves and help pick Medicare plans or supplement but what we do is we help families understand the importance of getting it right so\nYou know Medicare first of all it's it's a program that provides various healthcare benefits to people at the age of sixty five or older although those who are younger can get it if they're disabled as well\nAnd really Medicare has two parts there's something called part a which is known is hospital insurance in part B is known as medical insurance\nNow you're eligible for free today if you're at least sixty five years or ... or older or and you or your spouse worked in paid Medicare taxes for at least ten years\nOr so you can get those without paying premiums under a lot of conditions but really it's about understanding that Medicare benefits can really add up potentially saving you thousands of dollars in health care costs each year so take the time to work with a stand alone independent and you know Medicare supplemental professional to help build the proper plan for you\nLet's talk real quickly about long term care as well Brad because this is another one of those areas we need to ask that question sooner rather than later we can't get into a situation where we need long term care and then say okay now what how do I pay for this\nYeah no exactly right and and you know long term care is that extra layer of help that you get\nWhen you can't perform a couple of the activities of daily living on your own so you know things like bathing an eating you know these these services can take place in your home or in a facility either way and and how we help our clients plan for these big expenses because remember\nThese expenses are not covered by Medicare right\nSo unless you have a specific long term care coverage policy for them you're on your own and right now uh\nMedicare right so unless you have a specific long term care coverage policy for them you're on your own and right now a ... it can cost as much as eight or nine thousand a month\nOut of pocket if you don't have coverage so ah imagine what the cost in ten or Twenty years which is why having the appropriate coverage now\nIs something that we focus a lot on in our road map for retirement health care planning is one of our key areas we focus on so\nThere's a few different ways Jen that you can protect against long term care\nOr one of them that a lot of our clients will do is they'll add a long term care writer which for an added fees can be added to an annuity or life insurance policy in in that route is typically more affordable than like stand alone long term care insurance policies are\nSo many people will need long term care and that's certainly what if we need to think about that ... what about the legacy planning what if I die how do I make sure everything's taking care of\n... and that's obviously not a win but if it if a and a excuse me that's a wedding not enough obviously um but but what happens to your loved ones into your state when you die you\nKnow especially if you're the main bread winner um these are things you need to understand before that obviously happens and so the last phase Gen of our road map for retirement is estate planning or legacy planning we want to know how do I make sure that first and foremost my spouse is gonna be okay\nWhen I die not only from a financial standpoint but also from estate planning standpoint in a medical standpoint\nYou know but we have to make sure that we've got provisions in place to make sure that our assets transition to our beneficiaries efficiently hopefully without having to go through probate court in a private manner you know but from there we also want to make sure that if we need insurance we have enough in force you know things like I'm\nHaving a life insurance policy can help pay all of the costs that are going to exist when we die things like taxes to our kids are grandkids or\nA you know paying off a balance of a mortgage or debts these are things that for pennies on the dollar we can own in retirement to make a big impact for our spouses or children or grandchildren ones were gone so again\nCovering all areas of retirement all the way down to dotting the I's and crossing the T's of legacy an estate planning is just as important as how should I invest my money in retirement\nBrett how do we get started and is planning process if we haven't gotten to that estate planning part of our retirement plans or we hadn't thought about long term care how do we come in and sit down with you\nYeah well it it's really Gen as easy as picking up the phone and giving us a call you know we are so excited to hear from our listeners weak in and week out we have so many families who call us and so many families were able to help get on the proper path\nFor a successful retirement and so if you're listening today and you'd like that guidance or that help with how to tie it altogether for retirement\nWith an independent
