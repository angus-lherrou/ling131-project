tree of life congregation in Pittsburgh squirrel hill neighborhood six people were also wounded including six police officers for a closer look at these types of events we're joined live now by Michigan State police first lieutenant Michael Shaw\nA first off good evening lieutenants ah thank you for doing this with us\nAnd good evening thanks for having me\nAnother mass shooting and I'm speaking to you on the phone about it's a hate crime or not it's a mass shooting in a place where people normally don't expect something like this to happen\nYou ... on the police force in the Michigan State police how often do you prepare for something like this at a synagogue or a church place of worship\nEveryday um unfortunately it it's the times that we live and and it's something that we need to look from a back all the way from nine eleven to current we've done a lot of things to change the way that we look at events like these are to make sure that we're not only working together where you know that the federal government but also\nWith the state law enforcement agencies across the country we set up a fusion center in Michigan after nine eleven were able to monitor situations like this to see one if there's any threats towards Michigan and I can reassure people there's no known threats like this that that's in the state of Michigan\nBut we also work very well with the community we we've talked about if you see something say something it's something I've talked about on on your station quite often or no matter where you're at a place of worship or in a mall anywhere that you know something that just doesn't seem right to you or even in your own neighborhood where you see somebody may acting a little strange or load different\nUh don't be afraid to contact law enforcement even it by turned out to be absolutely nothing it's always better to be safe than sorry\nAnd how would you define that see something say something what is something that may be different what are they supposed to be looking for\nI always talk to people about their guts we always you know people you you always get that funny feeling that you know it's always harder to describe to yourself or somebody else when you're walking through an area where you say something doesn't seem right to you at all on the low hair stand back and your neck and just you know something's just not right or doesn't seem like\nSomething in the ordinary and that's usually how we try to best to describe it it's hard to tell people see things in different ways of but if you see a neighbor that that things are different than you're used to or if you go to a community or you see somebody that's there all the time or something that's taking pictures in the areas somebody that's kind of mapping things\nTrue or if you go to a community or you see somebody that's there all the time or something it's taking pictures in the areas somebody that's kind of mapping things out a lot of times before these events though they'll take dry runs to see how law enforcement will act when they come and show up at those situations\nAs little things like that that kind of you tip you off a little bit make your gut feel a little bit funny or give us a call ... will check that out and make sure that everything's OK\nRemain vigilant he he's a first lieutenant Michael shah with the Michigan State police
