problems and not getting caught up in credit you're running for governor who can roll up her slave filled coalition to solve problems I ask for your vote on November ...\nAttorney general shooting\nOn bill shooting and I'm working hard to serve as Michigan's next governor\nMy grandparents were teachers my mom and dad were high school sweethearts grew up in the great depression by the time of a difficulty from Michigan and America when I was just a boy six years old my dad died of a heart attack my mom she was resilient raised my two older sisters and me as a single mom\nMy wife Cynthia and I went to the same bus stop and she and I daughter Heidi in sun bill attended public schools and middle and then all the shooting still called middle and home\nI'm running for governor because I Want Michigan to grow and I want people to call Michigan their home state of play sleigh live\nNot a vacation state that a place they visit and I want Michigan to be a job state a growth state and a paycheck state and the election it's upon us right now in a question from Michigan is when we go forward or we'd go backward\nWell we're going forward we're not going backwards because we've lived through one last decade the failed governorship of Jennifer Granholm and you remember that a Fifteen Percent unemployment five hundred thousand lost jobs and people left the state in droves\nAnd here's my paycheck agenda cut your income tax lawyer auto insurance rates rebuild our infrastructure improve our schools and quality affordable health care my opponents agenda wretched and what burned Garland guilt crush\nOne word for friends extreme way extreme job crushing tax increases\nMore mandates will drive and families and businesses out of Michigan and government run health care all the ingredients go backwards but we're going forward and Michigan a big hopes and bold aspirations and Michigan of more jobs more people and bigger paychecks and folks we can do this together we can win again Michigan\n... we're gonna move into the questions now again you'll both have a minute for this and as I Would like to say\nWe will be polite but ruthless on enforcement of our time was up to him out of the first course in ... ah what were you will be first on answering this in the first debate for a couple of weeks ago in Grand Rapids you were asked to stay very simply how much is it going to cost to fix the roads and where's the money going to come from\nA your answers we're not quite as simple as the question would seem to demand so I'd like to try to do in\nA recent independent infrastructure commission found that we need to be spending more than two billion dollars a year on our roads they both talked about drawing off money off of other budgets in the state and combining it with federal money which services or departments can expect to see money redirected toward our roadways\nOr higher taxes a possibility if so what taxes\nAnd I prefer to hear about your plan rather than your take on your opponents plan sort of we're\nSure so I'm leaving within it real infrastructure plan because I Know families across Michigan are tired of paying the Republican road tax which is in the form of replacing our windshields for our tires are getting a line let's say I tell you I talked to a woman the other day\nTax which is in the form of replacing our windshields or our tires are getting a line that's\nHow I tell you I talked to a woman the other day in Ann Arbor she had an aneurysm and her ambulance took a longer route to the hospital it was a life and death situation but the shorter route was written with ...\nAnd I want you to think about this there boxes full of kids who are on their way to school that are going over bridges that have temporary of\nTemporary supports wages are better that's why I'm leaving with an infrastructure plan\nI create and rebuild Michigan infrastructure bank I Will write a budget in the first part of next year that actually dedicates two billion dollars it draws down ... billion from the federal government that means we get to work right away the legislatures not strong enough to take those votes\nI'll go straight to the public and pass a bond we need real solutions our roads are endangering us\nAnd this had on it towards towards or shooting rather if you could almost say matter\nYou know um Michigan needs to be a first class states and we need to have eroded to reflect the quality of the cars we build right here in Michigan and nobody nobody's on these roads more than I and our eighty three counties into ...\nAnd here's what we need to do number one specifically we need to make sure we have a full and complete auditor them dot and how they allocate um road funding across the states secondly we needed guarantees in warranties\nOne for roads and bridges just like any other products you might buy\nAnd when you did more federal funding coming from Washington\nI'll walk right through the front door of a the White House because of my relationships called the secretary of transportation Elaine shower friend of mine and be an advocate for more federal dollars coming to Michigan and we're on the track right now of one point two billion dollars through twenty Twenty one on road funding I Want to expand that\nIn every aspect of ... going to chip in because roads will be a priority\nNow my opponent what she says she wants to fix the darn roads she's going to raise your darn taxes I'm going to protect your wallet she's going to raise your taxes is an extreme approach and it would take us back back to the last decades the fifty percent unemployment and uh you know many people's\nLives in ... sort of ... you have thirty seconds though to rebuild\n[laughter] well I Want to correct the attorney general if the saying is we're going to fix the dam road and I put a real solution on the table no more of this Valone I Am tired of politicians I've just given talking points instead of a real solutions\nSenior going to walk through the front door of the Trump White house doesn't fix a single pothole in the state and I'm tired of traveling roads that are falling apart I'm tired of how uncompetitive it makes us and I'm tired of how it's endangering citizens on our roads were going to get this done and we got to do it together phony\nTalking points don't fix the problem\nBut the scary truth is that the state that is home to Twenty one percent of the world's freshwater hasn't dozens of communities that have high lead in their water right now coming out of their ...\nAnd dozens more that have pee fast is leading into our drinking water the fact of the matter is we need to create it department up the great lakes and fresh water that is tasked\nWith overseeing the stewardship of this resource that is all of ours\nThe drinking water ... at the cabinet level as something that I Am committed to because when their problems arise we need to take action we need to shut down corporate threats to our water we need to hold polluters accountable and get to work cleaning up the drinking water and the state of Michigan\nIt is appalling the state of\nThe state of water and the state of the ... the lack of safety in our water and our trade journal hasn't done anything\nAnd that it's time attorney general shooting you have thirty seconds for rebuttal and I want to remind you that we do want to know what you would do about ...\nYou know and the situation in Flint\nIs such that you know pastors feel their gut bunch got punched by the state\nAnd Gretchen was done nothing in terms of environmental policy in her fourteen years in the legislature\nAnd the only bills you pass concerning water was something about regulating the swimming pools that doesn't help families and slid north respected necessarily all these are issues and it'd be done on solid science is the twenty first century we can have economic development and we can have water that is produced enough with\nSenator ... well that's exactly the kind of an gobbledygook answer that people are so tired out when it comes to ... I don't believe that they should be taking water out of our ground and selling it\nAnd I want to stop that I also want to get the oil out of the great lakes to get to work suing on behalf of the communities that have people with Governor Snyder asked the attorney general to initiate that so last July he still has done nothing just like it\nOther communities that have people with Governor Snyder asked the attorney general to initiate that so last July he still has done nothing just like he didn't stop off an answer calls from people for ... for two years while their kids were brushing their teeth with water and it is\nA show I'm so sorry that we were going to move on to the next person I'm afraid I I\nWant to come back to that on on on your own on your own time to do that later we'll move to the next question which is about immigration currently several thousand people are trying to make their way through Mexico from Honduras with an eye toward reached new heights boots\nI miss my ... and his poor jet fuel on the national immigration debate mission of course as a rich cross or shouldn't of an immigrant communities much of the debate has of course centered on illegal immigration where we've come to find this year but right now Michigan the Sunni Seventy five percent decrease in legal\nRefugees arrivals um in fact it's been a national record\nLow this year on the across the country I Would like your thoughts on immigration and whether Michigan should be sanctuaries state sort of river\nMinor stand the anxiety that we all feel about this issue because we have a broken immigration\nSystem in this country and it's not working we need leadership out of Washington DC to step up but here's what I now\nMichigan was built by immigrants the fins came ... west middle Easterners came to the airborne all for opportunity and a good life right here in Michigan and it is a strength that we have\nBut what I can tell you is that as a mom\nAs a mission gander as an American\nI was outraged and heartbroken when I saw the Trump Administration where children away from their parents\nThat is not who we are those are not Michigan values and governor I Will stand up to an administration that does that I Will work to make sure that we protect jobs and this is a place where people come to to make a good life again\nBut I Will not stand silently by when the Trump Administration separates kids and their parents\nHer attorney general have a minute on this\nYou know I met with a new American similar just received his citizenship and it made you feel so proud to hear his prize winners shared with me but now he's an American citizen and our immigration policy in America needs to be hopeful and welcoming but you got to play by the rules and you have to make sure we protect our border\nAnd when I'm governor there'll be no sanctuary cities in Michigan now senator what murder\nOr if she has her way she'd make Michigan a sanctuary state she wants to disband ice\nHer I'm a lieutenant governor choice Garland Gilchrist wants to eliminate the department of homeland security and those are extreme positions they're reckless in Garland Gilchrist as well or wants to has had these anti Semitic anti Israeli twitch\nThese pro Hamas ranch or ... as a terrorist organization and choosing that first decision shows bad judgment on senator ... part one I'm governor of Michigan will be no sanctuary cities\nAnd Gretchen went where she has her way with Michigan to be a sanctuary states that's that's a sort of rumor\nDon't listen to that nonsense\nThis is a desperate campaign that is flailing to stay alive here's the fact of the matter if you watch the news tonight you saw hatred you saw fear you saw terrorism but this guy to stand here and call me extreme and imply all sorts of things is ridiculous and that's the kind of rhetoric has that has created this\nUgly environment in this country I Am running against that too I'm running against bad roads and schools that are falling behind but I'm running against us nasty rhetoric that is coming out of\nThe environment in this country I Am running against that too I'm running against bad roads and schools that are falling behind but I'm running against us nasty rhetoric that is coming out of bill shooting in the Trump Administration\nHas time a half minute for you know attorney general as she never answered the question sooner what murdered not answered the question about sanctuary cities I'm opposed if she had her way Michigan to be a sanctuary state she wants to disband ice I think that's reckless in extreme\nHer a running the proposed a running mate Garland Bill Frist wants to eliminate department of homeland security that's extreme that's way out of the mainstream that's why this race which is so close as a jump ball I'm going to win this because people don't want Michigan to be a sanctuary state\nI Want to talk about mental health\nBy so many measures Michigan's mental health system is severely lacking were hardly alone in that distinction but watch any news castor read any newspapers story about a violent crime and it frequently seems connected to a mental health issue whether we're talking about\nA homelessness and drug use the domestic violence what is your specific plan for improving Michigan's mental health services and if we're going to invest more in it\nWhere will that money come from attorney general shooting\nThe certainly there's a mental health crisis in the state when you see some of the tragic shootings or across this country\nWhen the people raised their hand and the figure to sense are asking for help and they receive none we need to provide assistance that means you're in the state of Michigan we're going to have to increase our mental health services for people and it goes to the opioid crisis as well\nBecause this opioid crisis Israel where we have more prescriptions for opioids and its citizens of the state and we need to make sure that we crack down on a lot of the over the distribution of opioids I joined with forty other attorney general attorneys general to do just that\nAnd how would you get these resources we have to Michigan to grow my paycheck agendas about cutting taxes\nLuring auto insurance rates and that'll stimulate our economy to grow and we can't be a smaller less significant state I Want to make sure that Michigan rows and we made the cut taxes so we we can compete with other ... states across this country\nPart senator with murder the same question dean family Michigan's mental health system never recovered after the angler here and we've not had mental health at the cat at the cabinet level\nWe've fallen behind for one of the things that differentiate differentiates me for my opponent is that I work to expand access to health care in the states and we've got more work to do across the aisle and I've worked with Governor Snyder to get it done six hundred and eighty thousand people in our state got health care coverage because of that\nTo point three billion dollars on the economic activity thirty thousand jobs that all is a stride but we've got more work to do the problem is that my opponent wants to rip that all away and do away with it he's filed nine lawsuits into exactly that\nThis is a dire circumstance we have to keep moving toward getting more people covered in the state not the war\n... attorney general bill shooting you have thirty seconds to rip out\nFor juniors and the legislature Gretchen ... only passed three bills did nothing to help on mental health did nothing to do on health didn't do anything to accomplish on on healthcare\nNow I Want to make sure the way of affordable accessible health care for everyone and that we maintain preexisting conditions and a grudge and one was done nothing in or fourteen years and you know what I filed suits against Obama girl because it didn't work taxes went up\nAnd you couldn't choose your own doctor but I always maintain coverage for pre existing conditions senator\nWants a foreign concept to the attorney general\nChoose your own doctor but I always maintain coverage for pre existing conditions senator\nWants a foreign concept to the attorney general but you can get a lot done if you don't care about credit\nDuring the time that I was in the legislatures in the minority but you know what I got a lot done six hundred and eighty thousand people got\nHealth care coverage because of that work I'm grateful that Governor Snyder embrace the Affordable CARE Act unfortunately his own attorney general has filed a lawsuit after lawsuit after loss of nine of them to rip that coverage away they eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions\nSuch as you know are there any move on Memorial Day so the question of Detroit's ... ended up getting an awful lot of the ... the blame I guess you'd say in our failure to make the cut for Amazon Second World headquarters\nOf ... a big part of the failure a with a lack of talent workers who were prepared for the jobs that Amazon is offering you both talked a lot about preparing more workers to steal trade with factors robots and technology are ... gonna continue to put pressure on employment\nWe are going to build a coalition that addresses the the skills gap the talent gap in the states we have to do it together and that's why we need a governor who can build a coalition bring people together and make sure that every one of us has that thrill parent to a hype\nIs to shoot at you know the best approach drug for high school and for college education there's a stronger economy and I have the support of the Michigan chamber of commerce business leaders of Michigan the reel to reel chores and they're real Taylor's Phyllis goes on and on because they know my paycheck agenda will drive jobs in the state\nSenator ... agenda is an economic collapse plants will take us back we have to go forward and build on the success of the last eight years I'll do that but raising taxes and having more government mandates will send us backward and that's not where in Michigan will go in November\nThis next question comes from a viewer and it concerns the falls fraud scandal um we've had tens of thousands of Michigan are wrongly accused of unemployment insurance fraud\nThe lucky ones only lost benefits and paid fines others though had to file for bankruptcy and some lost their homes\nIt's a matter that's currently before the state Supreme Court the attorney general's office is arguing the case on behalf of the unemployment insurance agency I suppose your responsibilities can change if you move from the ages office to governor ... up but to both of you as governor what would you do about the more than forty thousand people who are caught up in the U.S\nAttorney general I think all the people who get ripped off by the uh unemployment insurance agency should be reimbursed and made whole\nThey got ripped off and that was wrong now my job as attorney general is to represent the departments of government and and quite frankly I think this whole lawsuit as the wrong approach to what we need to do in Michigan is make sure we have a stronger economy\nThat's why I Want to cut the eliminate the grand on with more income tax increase there was supposed to avenge temporary and it was caused Michigan families eight million dollars since was put into place in two thousand seven\nAnd we need to cut auto insurance rates and give Michigan families a pay raise\nThat's why we drive our state for its now centered or ... or a economic plans the more taxes yards your wallet and for economic plan to go forward uh let me put a warning label on everything\nYour job is in jeopardy because higher taxes more mandates which job growth and take us back to the last decade we can't do that we have to go forward that's where we will do and bill shooters governor\nRight senator ... where I ask you the same question about the false fraud scandal\nWhile I have to imagine some motions are going to be filed now after that statement especially the first part of that you know we need government to work for people again we need politicians who understand that they are public servants\nThis unemployment insurance agency scandal has ruined lives in the state forty thousand people\nThe attorney general likes to say he's going to be a paycheck governor when he went after and they still pursuing people who are wrongfully accused of fraud by our state\nRuining people's lives it is cruel it is an abuse of power\nAnd we deserve better but there is no question that this next governor is going to play a major role and how that shakes out and as governor\nI'm always going to stand up to make sure that people are treated fairly that they get aimed just resolved there's opportunity in the states right Mr attorney general that's thirty ...\nIt was going to stand up to make sure that people are treated fairly that they get aimed just resolved there's opportunity in the states right Mr attorney general that's thirty second\nListen to the question there to the post in Michigan and just a few short days is all about whether we're going forward or going backwards I think we need to build on the success of the last eight years and a senator or wants to take us back where she'll repeal right to work\nShe wants to raise taxes she wants to reinstate the prevailing wage statutes that is making sure we have a cost controls and go public construction projects and she just wants to raise taxes on anything that moves that was take us back to the economic ditch we need to go forward and Michigan we can't go backwards that's they're just added\nTime senator ... thirty seconds well that's ridiculous and I oppose the retirement tax when it was running through the legislature a Republican\nYou part of the Republican tax package that those who decided it was great news for taxpayers sell it wasn't there a lot of hard working people on the state who played by the rules and the government changed them on them at the last moment that's what a failure of government looks like those are the people that I care about that I fight for every single day and again that that is\nThat the government order and ask questions so this past weekend the New York times\nReported on the efforts of the Trump administration's rollback protections even recognition of people who were transgendered\nThat comes as we in this state have been debating whether the Michigan so Elliott Elliott Larson civil rights act should be expanded to include protections for the old you'd be to queue or discrimination problems\nOut ... what is the right way forward on this issue and mindful of the now famous birthday cake taste how do you protect the religious freedoms of those whose face these anything other than the heterosexuality because of some sort of ...\nI Believe that it is time for Michigan to get on the right side of history\nThis is twenty eight team we need to amend the Eliot Larson civil rights act so that everyone in the ... community has full civil rights\nAnd camp lose their job or lose their homes because of who they are or who they lock it is wrong and it is bad for business I Am going to fight every single day until we mend our Eliot Larson civil rights act to do just that\nMy opponent on the other hand we said millions of taxpayer dollars\nOn has failed crusade\nAgainst marriage equality taking it all the way to the Supreme Court putting junk science tests on the stand and embarrassing us as a state we deserve better there's a reason businesses that block the Grand Rapids chamber of commerce because they endorsed him because they know bigotry is bad for business\nYou know I was raised by a single mom and my mama and my two sisters taught me the importance of treating everybody the same you treat everybody as a family\nAnd you treat everybody with grace and dignity respect and honor and that's what I'll do as the next governor the state of Michigan and I'll make sure that any law\nAny law that just fast whether it's LA last Larson or any other law is free from discrimination on anyone whether it's\nRace color creed or gender or sexual orientation religion no matter what we can we must have the states is free from discrimination and when you have a state that is diverse and they're just reflects the mosaic of Michigan and the best way to assist in that is make sure we have a strong economy\nThough I Want to cut taxes and graduate or wants to raise taxes I Want to make sure we lower auto insurance rates and Britain when we're done nothing to lower auto insurance rates for fourteen years as a as the legislature we need to make sure we have a strong economy and a diverse workforce and ... where is economically\nFor ... for fourteen years as as the legislature we need to make sure we have a stronger economy and a diverse workforce enriching went merge economic plans they take us back in the last decade or wouldn't where you've got thirty seconds for bottle if you'd like\nI've met so many people across our state and who are part of the ... community simply want respect protection under the law\n... would be the most anti O. G. P. T. Q. governor of the states ever had if he wins this race you don't have to just trust me on this do the research he's been an office for thirty three years and have bought ... community you don't you can't\nListen and believe the things that he says it in these last three months they fly in the face of all the\nOrnaments time attorney general you've got thirty seconds left again the fact is\nMy mom and my two sisters I was raised by three women taught me to respect everyone with a dignity grace\nIn honor and that's really do is your next to Tunisia as your next governor and\nYou know a senator ... economic plans would drive us back\nThey take us back to the last decade a fifty percent unemployment a five hundred thousand jobs lose lost in our state people leaving the state in droves we have to go forward her agenda centered ... would take us back we're not going there we're going forward [noise]\nAll right my next question is about gerrymandering it's quick and to the point specifically how will you vote on proposal to Mr attorney general we'll start with you and why will you vote the way you vote\nOn voting against proposal to I think that we should have the ability like forty other states you do\nFor a a individual voting exercising people's discretion an honor and a thoughtful listen every uh uh but we have listen Michigan's a decision coming up in a few days is about whether we go forward or backward when do you make sure we cut taxes when you to lower auto insurance rates where you improve our schools\nAnd rebuild our roads that's the most important things that will drive our state for\nMy paycheck agenda will do that senator ... economic policy it's an economic collapse plan which goes back and remember I saw a guy the other day who said bill you got to when we can't go backwards user home builder remember one home ... home values are underwater\nPeople would leave their homes to leave their cheese on the kitchen counter and go we can't have that we got to go forward and Michigan not backwards and centered ... where is economic plan would take us back where we have to go forward in Michigan\nSenator what are the same question to you about gerrymandering how will you vote on proposal to win whites\nWhile I'm going to be a gaffe thought and I commend the people that did the work for voters not politicians was an all volunteer army of people that have had it with politics as usual who want government that represents a that works for us the people again\nI think that the gerrymandering that the Michigan Legislature has gone to pick their constituents instead of constituents picking our legislators has contributed to this environment where\nForty nine there as well take a look at some of the current temperatures pretty
