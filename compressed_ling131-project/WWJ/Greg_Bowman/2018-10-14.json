Hoagy shouldn't vis a commitment this military agreement this sale a be in jeopardy and that's what senators are arguing but the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House is approaching that show because compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a disconnect um in terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence and as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have both video and audio of this murder happening\nBut the U.S does not yet a claim that they believe that that is the case they haven't seen everything lined up\nThat completely approves the allegations that the Turks are making here so yesterday the state department said well well well let's not get ahead of ourselves let's not let all these rumors dominate the conversation\nBefore we talk about the repercussions that the Saudis will potentially see\nOn the other side of the coin you have senators on the health saying let's put the threats out there a head\nOf what we know happened so that the Saudis know that they can't do this that they can't kill journalists to say bad things about the leadership in Saudi Arabia and get away with it saved two

unfortunately she was outed and she face those same threats against her who do you blame for this\nAnd she wished to remain anonymous and unfortunately she was outed and she face those same threats against her\nWho do you blame for the call\nI work I Do blame the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or to sing too\nI think it was the St Cavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an animal ... aside and they threw or to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to think that Kavanaugh nomination\nBut did you strike you as a reluctant witness once you do to us for ... and public\nNo she did not seem to be reluctant that by that point she had already been outed and I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement\nI'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard I I've been adamant about that for years I did work with sexual assault a survivors back in college so this has been a long standing issue for\nSo let's take a pause give my audience a bit of your ... important to you it's important discovery sushi\nYeah absolutely so going back to my days at Iowa State university um it was just a a personal decision of mine to volunteer at a women's Chrysler shelter and I worked\nThe crisis hotline as well as carried a beeper as a responder for those women that has been either physically abused and domestic situations or those that had been\nA intimately violent violently sexually abused so I Would do calls to women at the jail um sometimes they would\nRetaliate against their abusers um I get calls at the hospital if they were doing rape kits\nUm I get calls on the crisis lying I Would respond to go with women to pick up groceries or you know mundane things and things even so it it's a very important topic to me to make sure that uh women and children are protected and sometimes those survivors where men as well\nSo we go to experience what was your own emotional reaction\nAnd what did you see or did not see a doctor ... testimony that reminded you of what you actually experience and those ...\nWell I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of corroboration from the witnesses that she identified and so when they came forward and in their statements basically said you know what this didn't happen or there was no such party\nUm it it hurt her credibility\nSenator Joni Ernst

S. is on the ground in Pyongyang and it was very evident um in that moment that they were controlling what was happening\nThe narrative and uh the logistics\nAnd yet at the end of it Pompeo comes out saying we're farther down the road we have some ground for potential second summit between the president and the chairman Kim so obviously they feel like a they made some garbage on this\nThey did make some yard edge in terms of continuing us North Korea discussions on at the end of August a beginning of September ... trip to North Korea was canceled\nWe thought that it looks like the two countries weren't really interacting anymore well now at least discussions seem to be back on track\n'em and North Korea did agree a pump has had to allow some inspectors into one of their nuclear test launch sites\nBut in terms of what was tangibly change about North Korea's nuclear capability and it's highly developed nuclear program nothing\nCBS is highly Edward thank you this week a judge in New York threw out some of the charges against disgraced Hollywood mobile Harvey Weinstein WCBS reporter Marla diamond has more\nListening Evans grand jury testimony was contradicted by emails that suggested her two thousand and four sexual encounter with wind steam was consensual the district attorney is still going ahead with the cases of the two other accusers defense attorney Ben Brafman\nWe are pleased with this development the case is not over but I think it is a permanently and irreparably damaged\nAttorney Carrie Goldberg spoke to reporters on ... behalf saying the da's decision to drop the case not invalidate the truth\nI think is really a need of reform Marley\nDiamond for CBS\nNews New York and now perhaps as a public service award or two about\nDisagreeing civil e you're CBS this morning cohost John Dickerson with his reporter's notebook\nI Would like to have an argument by which I mean I Would like to enjoy having an argument a brisk exchange of views where participants are in live and didn't learn something it is still possible\nThere are pockets of small tribes that still engage in this behavior so it does feel very rare passes for argument today or the shared off exchanges in social media and the vinegar\nThat is spoon back and forth on cable news Supreme Court depends on good arguments though the hearing tickets next member opened with what felt like a group drowning\nYour way of access to it not so good eighty percent\nMotives were questioned and serious issues were responded to with loud talking\nVery warm welcome to not feel given an opportunity\nWhen questions were asked the key to any good arguments\nThe nominee offered the usual peek a boo responses we pick judges who are to rule on the quality of arguments through a process where quality arguments are smothered bad arguments in danger of polarized nation you can't understand why a person Neal's at an NFL game or understand why that offends someone\nUnless you know how to argue and without understanding you have conflict a new book by Greg loop beyond often Jonathan height identifies the stakes unless we learned to argue better we will grow dumber be less happy and become a nation of grudge shoulders so how do you have an argument treat others like human beings have\nYou better we will grow dumber be less happy and become a nation of grudge shoulders so how do you have an argument treat others like human beings have a generous interpretation of their views allowed them to clarify before shaming them don't judge their motive\nOr judge them by the group there and if you are religious follow the first tenant of every major religion treat others the way you would like to be treated this leads to understanding and if that doesn't happen no one gets sore and reaches for the fireplace poker to settle things\nAbove all practice humility follow the maxim when arguing with a fool make sure they're not doing the same thing\nComing up next a preview of this week's forty eight hours and celebrating fifty years of LEDs up one of the CBS News weekend round up [noise]\nMurder together on the news radio nine fifty W.
