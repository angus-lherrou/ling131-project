weekend round up\nI'm Bill rake off Turkish officials have reportedly obtained recordings proving that Saudi journalist in Washington Post writer ... show he was killed\nWashington Post reports American officials are aware of the audio and video recordings they purportedly show is Saudi security team killing ... inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week where he'd gone to obtain documentation necessary for his upcoming wedding\nWhile the White House seems to be taking a wait and see approach to the investigation some lawmakers on Capitol Hill like senators Bob Corker Chris Murphy and Cory Gardner are expressing concern if they kill this journalist uh [noise]\nUh the relationship will be severely authored a animal changed much of a dynamic candlelight has to have one about things in the middle east is extraordinary case of us resident being kidnapped likely murdered\nBy us ally of President Trump's unwillingness to set out any consequences or even a threat of consequences essentially tells the Saudis that were okay with this kind of conduct and behavior I I think it's pretty\nBut one city as the state department report are currently Edwards says the administration seems to be taking a cautious approach in part because of its ties to the Saudi kingdom\nAnd critics would say that the president is already I'm taking some pressure off of\nThe kingdom and Saudi Arabia and saying that if even if they didn't do this we're still going to continue doing\nBusiness with them a senators on the health thinks that this shouldn't be a reason to stop those a commitment so we have made it to Saudi Arabia it's a hundred and ten billion dollars that the Saudis are buying in terms of US military equipment so that is a lot of money and\nThe president is arguing listen I don't want to jeopardize the business that's happening between the U.S companies in Saudi Arabia\nBecause other countries are going to come in and fill that void like China\nAnd Russia but at this point the question as well if it is proven that Saudi Arabia\nIs twofold did actually murder Jamal ... shouldn't this a commitment this military agreement this sale a be in jeopardy and that's what senators are arguing but the White House has yet to say that that would be the case\nAnd there's clearly a difference between how the White House is approaching the show because compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a disconnect um in terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence and as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have both video and audio of this murder happening\nBut the U.S does not yet a claim that they believe that that is the case they haven't seen everything lined up\nThat completely proves the allegations that the Turks are making here so yesterday the state department said well well well let's not get ahead of ourselves let's not let all these rumors dominate the conversation\nBefore we talk about the repercussions that the Saudis will potentially see\nOn the other side of the coin you have senators on the health saying let's put the threats out there a head of what we know happened so that the Saudis know that they can't do this that they can't kill and journalist who say bad things about the leadership and Saudi Arabia and get away with it saved two different kinds of tactics\nHere and we're going to have to see if the White House um get the head and starts putting out any threats before a conclusion has come to in this investigation\nOf CBS News department reporter currently outward there's reaction to this from virgins sir Richard Branson who says he uses spreading parts of his business with the Saudi kingdom as the investigation into the disappearance of the show continues\nYou're listening to the CBS News weekend round up Supreme Court associate justice Brett Kavanaugh hurt his first cases this week on the high court or for a bruising confirmation battle that his lip anger and resentment boiling on all sides on this week's edition of the takeout part just\nCBS News the White House correspondent major Garrett sat down with Republican senator Joni Ernst ... voted in favor of Kavanaugh\nI Do think that judge Kavanaugh was eminently qualified I did support him in my vote\nI also do believe that Dr Ford did experience some sort of trauma in her lifetime um I don't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh that perpetrated a that that intimate crime against or that I think she was outed um she wished to remain anonymous\nAnd unfortunately she was outed and she face those same threats against her who do you blame for this job I work I Do blame the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or just income I think it was to think Kavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an animal ...\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or dissing cover\nI think it was the think Kavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an animal ... aside and they threw or to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to think that cabinet nominees\nBut did you strike you as a reluctant witness once she did testify under oath in public\nNo she did not seem to be reluctant that by that point she had already been outed and I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement\nI'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard as I've been adamant about that for years I did work with sexual assault a survivors back in college so this has been a long standing issue for\nSo let's take a pause give my audience a bit of your ... important to you it's important discoveries\nYeah absolutely so going back to my days at Iowa State university um it was just a a personal decision of mine to volunteer at a women's Chrysler shelter and I worked\nThe crisis hotline as well as carried a beeper as a responder for those women that had been either physically abused and domestic situations or those that had been\nA intimately violent violently sexually abused so I Would do calls to women at the jail um sometimes they would\nRetaliate against their abusers um I get calls at the hospital if they were doing rape kits\nUm I get calls on the crisis line I Would respond to go with women to pick up groceries or you know mundane things and things even so it it's a very important topic to me to make sure that uh women and children are protected and sometimes those survivors were men as well\nSo we got to experience what was your own emotional reaction\nAnd what did you see or did not see a doctor Ford's testimony that reminded you of what you actually experiencing those codes that\nWell I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of cooperation from the witnesses that she identified and so when they came forward and in their statements basically said you know what this didn't happen or there was no such party [noise]\nUm it it hurt her credibility\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa was CBS has major Garrett on his superb podcast

because compared to the senator's we heard from from the Foreign Relations committee\nYeah so it's really a disconnect um in terms of how they want to approach the situation the Trump Administration is saying we need to get the facts here yes the Turks say that they have evidence that as you read earlier the Washington Post is reporting that they have both video and audio of this murder happening\nBut the U.S does not yet a claim that they believe that that is the case they haven't seen everything lined up\nThat completely proves the allegations that the Turks are making here so yesterday the state department said whoa whoa whoa let's not get ahead of ourselves let's not let all these rumors dominate the conversation\nBefore we talk about the repercussions that the Saudis will potentially see on the other side of the coin you have senators on the health saying let's put the threats out there a head\nOf what we know happened so that the Saudis know that they can't do this that they can't kill journalists who say bad things about the leadership and Saudi Arabia and get away with it saved two different kinds of tactics\nHere and we're going to have to see if the White House um get the head and starts putting out any threats before a conclusion is come to in this investigation\nOf CBS News State Department reporter currently outward there's reaction to this from virgins sir Richard Branson who says he uses spreading parts of his business with the Saudi kingdom as the investigation into the disappearance of the show continues\nYou're listening to the CBS News weekend round up Supreme Court associate justice Brett Kavanaugh heard is first cases this week on the high court after a bruising confirmation battle that his lip anger and resentment boiling on all sides on this week's edition of the takeout part just\nTo US News chief White House correspondent major Garrett sat down with Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa voted in favor of cabinet all\nBut I Do think that judge Kavanaugh was eminently qualified I did support him in my vote I also do believe that Dr Ford did experience some sort of trauma in her lifetime\nUm I don't believe it was Brett Kavanaugh that perpetrated a that that intimate crime against or that I think she was outed um she wished to remain anonymous\nAnd unfortunately she was outed and she face those same threats against her who do you blame for the job I work I Do blame the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or to sing too\nI think it was the St Cavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an animal ... aside and they threw or to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to think that Kavanaugh nomination\nOf judge you strike you as a reluctant witness once you do to us for ...\nYou know she did not seem to be reluctant by that point she had already been outed and I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement I'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard\nThink it was at that point then she was able to make her statement I'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard I I've been adamant about that for years I did work with sexual assault survivors back in college so this has been a long standing issue for\nSo let's take a pause give my audience a bit of your view on this important to you it's important this conversation\nYeah absolutely so going back to my days at Iowa State university um it was just a a personal decision of mine to volunteer at a women's crisis shelter and I worked the crisis hotline as well as carried a beeper\nAs a responder for those women that had been either physically abused in domestic situations or those that had been\nA intimately violent violently sexually abused so I Would do calls to women at the jail time sometimes they would\nRetaliate against their abusers um I get calls at the hospital if they were doing rape kits\nUm I get calls on the crisis line I Would respond to go with women to pick up groceries hey you know mundane things and things even so it's a very important topic to me to make sure that uh women and children are protected and sometimes those survivors where men as well\nSo was that experience what was your own emotional reaction\nAnd what did you see or did not see Dr ... testimony that reminded you of what you actually experiencing those coach this well\nI think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of cooperation from the witnesses set she identified and so when they came forward and in their statement basically said you know what this didn't happen or there was no such party [noise]\nUm it it hurt her credibility\nSenator Joni Ernst of Iowa was CBS has major Garrett on his superb podcast the takeout coming

S. translator\nUm and so they sat in their cars you know all prepared ready to head off to this a meeting that everyone was anticipating and then they sat there\nFor about five minutes but it felt like a lifetime because North Koreans were running around and kind of whispering to one another and I'm us Secret Service personnel were giving each other\nUm and ... did go with his Secret Service detail but you know that conversation on the runway wasn't forgotten by North Koreans they they hold us accountable um to what are their standards and their rules\nWhen the U.
