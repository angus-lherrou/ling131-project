investigation the president was given or inherited the equivalent of at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMuch of his wealth came from what the times calls do we attack seems by the Trump family including\nSetting up a sham corporation to disguise gifts from their parents\nAnd creating a strategy to undervalue real estate holdings on tax returns\nThe times estimates the Trump family avoided paying at least five hundred and fifty million dollars in gift and inheritance taxes\nPaying just over fifty million instead in a tweet President

Standard knows why\nOf calls to key senators about a judge Kavanaugh and uh it's it's just a lot of activism going on that it it's questionable how effective this is but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about\nA transfer calling in patch through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups use\nIts it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are also coming through this week\nIs that a new tactic to can you explain them\nSo it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us\nA call in general have gone up since Trump was elected had health care\nWhich was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism so a lot of these issues this ... this sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituents fairly\nUh because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then patching them through to their congressmen if they agree with them on this subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a good idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data isn't public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nYes so these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls\nI'm which can be stressful for them because you know you have Susan Collins is office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that in in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of\nViolent threats do happen on these phone calls in the staffers or just have to keep up this professional demeanor um when when speaking to your constituents and it depends on whether actually uh the colors are living in the state or not\nUm because senators don't really take into account if it's an out of state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they represent what\nYou're seeing a more organized attempt at an abused do you lose use of phone calls\nSure and one thing that we noticed in reporting this story is but it really happens for a lot of leash political issues like I said net neutrality\nUm appropriations bills where basically an organization will like I tell them telemarketer situation happens where they will call up a constituent and say\nHey how you feel about duck you think that these immigrants should stay here or what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something usually they're confused\nI'm at which point the telemarketer will pass them through the to their member of Congress\nOf confusion I Would say is one of the key give away is for congressional staffers here\nBecause the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time all they know is that they were called the the conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello and and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything\nAnd then the constituent says no you called me and so that sort of ... that sort of confusion really gives away to staffers that this is not as authentic as it was like like the advocacy groups would like for them to think it is a other times you know the constituents actually just outright say\nYou know I was told to tell you this\nAnd I actually think that is a one one staffer told me that\nRight say you know I was told that\nAnd I actually think that uh one one staffer told me that they had gotten a call one of these pass through calls where it that you would have been hard to tell them to oppose tax cut back in the winter\nAnd the constituent said you know they told me to tell you I don't like tax cuts that I sort of like I got it there is some room for error and these calls\nTrial by fire royal by phone from Capitol Hill
