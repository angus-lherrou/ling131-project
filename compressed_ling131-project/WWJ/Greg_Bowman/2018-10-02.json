happened well first of all welcome\nGreg in Brooklyn we appreciate your being ... to six of them we have over four hundred business and political leaders from all over western Wayne but also really southeast Michigan\nThat wants to network with the mirrors and the other elected leaders of the Eighteen or communities primarily along the eye to Seventy five telegraph court or and this has been an event to work in collaboration for the western region\nSo why is this event so important\nIt's important to western wanes on historically has been kinda presidential the community is kind of do their own thing they kind of do economic development in their own way this trying to get you know people know regions you don't actually know individual communities\nSo oh Brooks Patterson do just that the ... such a great job promoting Oakland County were trying to get western wing you know in its uniqueness from downtown Detroit within the county\nTo promote its own region and that's why something like this important so that got that\nTroy to have to be quite different from Belleville or rub your list\nAnd you have a two million people living in Wayne County it's the largest county in the state and um you know it's right in between you know what we're we're as between state and I'm In Ann Arbor were mission you know the airport the central location there so much going on and there's so much more than just downtown Detroit which is important\nAnd the speakers last couple of years tonight's event with Tom Wilson speaking\nAs what downtown Detroit does and how that benefits western Wayne and so that's what we're talking about we all benefit from that but you're right we have you know we're we're suburban communities and a lot of manufacturing\nA lot of a A R and D and stuff like that going on in these types of industries and it's more than just you know there's a lot of the manufacturing industry logistics better right here in western wing and it's better that we communicate with not just\nA downtown Detroit but all of southeast Michigan the leadership and the state and that's really what this is about is to talk about western wing and their role in all\nThis so what is one of the biggest issues facing western Wayne County\nI Would say uh availability to workforce the skilled workforce there is a tremendous shortage of skilled workers I get 'em\nFrom all kinds of manufacturers the\nElectricians seeing the operators of skilled workers it's not tax breaks it is the availability of talent as without question the number one issue we discuss all the time and there'll be a lot of manufacturers in the room tonight that will be talking about that very issue throughout the course of the day with the elected officials that are here and with each other\nDo you feel like a just a few seconds left but ah is western Wayne County competing with Detroit for example when you're trying to get Amazon or a new plant the located here or is that really try to work together I mean it's really look\nAt it no matter where employer comes in everyone benefits from the shopping the a new home buyers and the other business that happens to it we can't think about okay bill though Windsor alone you're Windsor north still wins if something comes to ... the whole region benefits and that's part of the collaboration thinking that we're trying to promote here\nOkay

and he joins us live good afternoon that afternoon thanks for having me thank you so much for being with us and so you are the mayor around me like and of course you hear me like can you just think metro airport\nAbsolutely you know but we're much more than an airport you know we're blessed to have Detroit metropolitan airport were thirty six square miles and we have about twenty five thousand residents but we have this kind of donut hole and the centers Detroit metro airport and it's a unique for service model because we have kind of for quadrant surround it\nThink about that airport they have about Eighteen thousand badges employees every day coming and going so we kind of think of it as like a city within a city\nSo a mayor I even though that's a blessing obviously to have the airport here in some ways I'm sure it's a challenge because you can't really do any developments over the over the tarmac so so is it or is it more of a plus or minus it brings a lot of attention and money ...\nYou know I think it is I mean some people you know they hear the noise and they think of the airport as a distraction but it really is we think of this opportunity because it's it's one of the largest economic engines in our region a so we've had a lot of business development in that area so as long as you're developing we still have an undeveloped land in our city so I\nKind of the analogy I use it as like paying the campus we've got a great opportunity to shape it\nBut we better be pleased when we're done so there are areas that are zoned for industrial or commercial residential as long as you work your plan or there are certain areas where the the runways are that because of noise you'd want to maybe go to industrial versus residential obviously\nBut if you work your plan I think it's more of a plus in anything\nOkay so you had mentioned in ... and we talked about that before we came out in the act is that a hindrance for people moving to the area people say I don't want to live by the airport\nYou don't believe it or not like I live on the northwest quadrant so I'll have people at my residents they don't even know the airports there because we're the runways line up and one of the noise actually is typically not in line with a residential there are some older areas that were there as it evolved and grew as an airport\nBut believe it or not I'll have people there that hear more about the trains and they do the the airplanes\nSo what what do you need what's the biggest challenge facing Ronnie listen what are your biggest needs right now maybe some of the stuff you'd be talking about today\nYeah absolutely so so one of the things in common and the reason I'm here's also representing the conference of western wanes so um this year there chairman a which is basically Eighteen communities representing seven hundred thousand residents\nSo what we do is we work well together on all local issues that impact not just rama noodles but if you're in love owning your north fillers urine township\nTheir common issues combination she's like I'm In the civil finance or what's happened over the last Twenty years uh you know we're all doing more with less from the state level or the property values that drop from oh eight till now as a loss in revenue so we're all trying to work together roll up our sleeves a nonpartisan just\nBut trying to find solves\nAnd we do have to go in just a moment but I Do know that you believe in customer service and good customer service so does that come into play\n... absolutely I mean I came from the business world so when I came here and took office November of twenty Thirteen I brought a business management system with it\nAnd customers are the residents the businesses everybody because we get our revenue from property tax from five to four pitchers so our job is to take that revenue and give the best value in service to the customer so oh it's really a culture that we put into place and I think it's refreshing culture for people that come into our Tom\nThanks very much for stopping by with us today that's a rub your list may early ... who's just one of a number of dignitaries on hand
