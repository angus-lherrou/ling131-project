system that could be used by the president in the event of a national emergency correspondent in a war\nWhen he went off it wasn't immediately obvious in places like Santa Monica and at New York's Grand Central station where this couple said they knew it was coming\nWe were warned about it it has been in the paper and everything else was no big shot [noise] but it became a moment on TV [noise] my\nNon Twitter where the hash tag presidential alert was trending and generated jokes and means with the Houston Zoo sending a cute baby elephant alert and the New York Mets saying this is not a test Jacob big rom is the best pitcher in baseball it's similar to the local ... weather alerts sent a mobile\nPhones planning for the alert system began in two thousand six but some people said their phones didn't go off\nTwelve minutes after the alert we ask that Duncan's\nDid you get the alerts know what's what's there to tell you I\nWill say if you do you ever see a real presidential alert pay attention theme is Antwon Johnson\nTake those things very seriously when they come across your mobile device or that appears on radio and television or they're not the type of alerts that should be ignored at anytime\nFamous had the test was acceptable phone carrier and including T Mobile told us it may have taken up to thirty minutes for alerts to go through the mobile than it had no problem outside of that\nIf you were on an active phone call at the time he may not have gotten the alert but otherwise there's no way to opt out of the alert and aware of CBS News New York\nNew York times investigation is casting doubt on President Trump's claims he's a self made billionaire I got a very\nVery small loan from my father many years ago I built into a massive empire and I paid my father back that\nMr Trump has said that loan was for one million dollars but according to a New York times investigation the president was given or an heritage the equivalent of at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMuch of his wealth came from what the times calls ... by the Trump family including\nSetting up a sham corporation to disguise gifts from their parents\nAnd creating a strategy to undervalue real estate holdings on tax returns\nThe times estimates the Trump family avoided paying at least five hundred and fifty million dollars in gift and inheritance taxes\nPaying just over fifty million instead in a tweet President Trump's slam the times for doing a quote very old boring and often told ... piece on me President Trump has

New York\nIt's not a good time to answer the phones on Capitol Hill Haley bird at the Weekly Standard knows why hilly\nPer week usually depending on the topics that Congress has addressing so in the Senate right now predictably you have\nA lot of calls to key senators about a judge Kavanaugh and uh it's it's just a lot of activism going on that it it's questionable how effective this is but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about\nA transfer calling and patch through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups use\nIts it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are also coming through this week\nIs that a new tactic can you explain the so it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us a call in general have gone up since\nTrump was elected and had health care which was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism so a lot of these issues this ... this sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituents fairly\nUm because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to their congressmen if they agree with them on the subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a good idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data isn't public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nYes so these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls\nI'm which can be stressful for them because you know you have Susan Collins is office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that in in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of\nViolent threats do happen on these phone calls in the staffers or just have to keep up this professional demeanor um when when speaking to these constituents and it depends on what they are actually uh the colors are living in the state or not\nA because senators don't really take into account if it's an outer state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they represent\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at an abuse the losers of phone calls sure\nOne thing that we noticed in reporting this story is but it really happens for a lot of leash political issues\nLike I said net neutrality\nAppropriations bills where basically an organization will like I tell them telemarketer situation happens where they will call up a constituent and say hey how you feel about DACA you think that these immigrants should stay here\nOr what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something usually they're confused\nI'm at which point the telemarketer will pass them through the to their member of Congress\nOf confusion I Would say is one of the key give away is for congressional staffers here\nBecause the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time all they know is that they were called the the conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello\nAnd and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything and then the constituents says no you called me and so that sort of ... that sort of confusion\nReally gives the way to staffers that this is not as authentic as it was like like the advocacy groups would like for them to think it is a other times you know the constituents actually just outright say you know I was told to tell you\nLike for them to think it is um other times you know the constituents actually just outright say you know I was told that\nAnd I actually think that um one one ... told me that they had gotten a call one of these pass through calls where it had been told to tell them to oppose tax cut back in the winter\nAnd the constituents that you know they told me to tell you I don't like tax cuts that I sort of like I got it there is some room for error and these calls\nTrial by fire trial by phone from

alerts sent a mobile phones\nPlanning for the alert system began in two thousand six but some people said their phones didn't go off\nTwelve minutes after the alert we ask that Duncan's\nDid you get the alerts no one wants to tell you I\nWill say if you do ever see a real presidential alert pay attention FEMA's Antwon Johnson\nTake those things very seriously when they come across your mobile device or that appears on radio and television or they're not the type of alerts that should be ignored at anytime\nFamous had the test was successful phone carrier and including team mobile told us it may have taken up to thirty minutes for alerts to go through the mobile said it had no problems outside of that if you were on an active phone call at the time he may not have gotten the alert but otherwise there's no way to opt out of the alert\nAnd aware of CBS News New York\nNew York times investigation is casting doubt on President Trump's claims he's a self made billionaire\nI got a very very small loan from my father many years ago I built into a massive empire as I said my father back deadline\nMr Trump has said that loan was for one million dollars but according to a New York times investigation the president was given or an heritage the equivalent of at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMuch of his wealth came from what the times calls do we have seen by the Trump family including\nSetting up a sham corporation to disguise gifts from their parents\nAnd creating a strategy to undervalue real estate holdings on tax returns the times estimates the Trump family avoided paying at least five hundred and fifty million dollars in gift inheritance taxes\nPaying just over fifty million instead in a tweet President Trump's slam the times for doing a quote very old boring and often told his piece on me President Trump has previously boasted of taking advantage of tax laws without breaking them\nI have brilliantly use those laws tax investigators in New York state are now reviewing the allegations Kenneth Greg CBS News\nNew York it's not a good time to answer the phones on Capitol Hill Haley bird at the Weekly Standard knows why Hillary joins me on the line Haley has been an onslaught of calls to Congress what's going on and just so busy or the phone lines\nSo a lot of officers keep track of how many calls they get a per week usually depending on the topics that Congress as addressing so in the Senate right now predictably you have a lot of calls to key senators about a judge cap and not and uh it it's just a lot of activism going on that\nIt it's questionable how effective it is but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about a transfer calling and patch through college but\nAnd well how effective it is but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about a transfer calling and patch through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups use\nIts it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are also coming through this week\nIs that a new tactic to can you explain them\nSo it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us a call in general have gone up since Trump was elected and had healthcare\nWhich was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism so a lot of these issues this ... this sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituents fairly\nUm because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to their congressmen if they agree with them on a subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a good idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data isn't public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nYes these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls\nI'm which can be stressful for them because you know you have Susan Collins is office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that in in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of\nViolent threats do happen on these phone calls and the staffers or just have to keep up this professional demeanor um when when speaking to these constituents and it depends on whether actually uh the colors are living in the state or not\nUm because senators don't really take into account if it's an out of state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they represent\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at a uh these day lose use of phone calls\nSure and one thing that we noticed in reporting this story is but it really happens for a lot of leash political issues\nLike I said net neutrality um appropriations bills where basically an organization will like I tell them telemarketer situation happened where they will call up a constituent and say hey how you feel about duck you think that these immigrants should stay here\nUh what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something usually they're confused\nI'm at which point the telemarketer will pass them through the to their member of Congress\nA confusion I Would say is one of the key giveaways for congressional staffers here because the constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time\nAll they know is that they were called the the conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello and and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything\nAnd then the constituent says no you called me and so that sort of ... that sort of confusion really gives away to staffers that this is not as authentic as it was like like the advocacy groups would like for them to think it is\nUm other times you know the constituents actually just outright say you know I was told to tell you this\nAnd I actually think this um one one staffer told me that they had gotten a call one of these pass through cause whereas a constituent had been told to tell them to oppose tax cuts back in the winter\nMe that they had gotten a call one of these pass through cause that you had been told to tell them to oppose tax cut back in the winter and the constituents that you know they told me to tell you I don't like tax cut but I sort of like that so that there is some room for error and these calls\nTrial by fire trial by phone from Capitol Hill Weekly Standard reporter Haley bird although we can run a thanks Haley thank you coming up burning\nIn a flood zone seven year old son at the rate

News\nNew York if not a good time to answer the phones on Capitol Hill Haley bird at the Weekly Standard knows why Hillary joins me on the line Haley has been an onslaught of calls to Congress what's going on and just so busy or the phone lines\nSo a lot of officers keep track of how many calls they get a per week usually depending on the topics that Congress as addressing so in the Senate right now predictably you have a lot of calls to key senators about a judge cabinet and uh it's it's just a lot of activism going on that\nIt it's questionable how effective it is but my colleague Tony ... and I recently wrote a story about\nA transfer calling and patch through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups use\nIts it's widespread on Capitol Hill\nThat's through college which is another form of advocacy that different groups use its it's widespread on Capitol Hill and so some of these are also coming through this week\nYou set a new tactic to can you explain them\nSo it's not new it's been around for a few years but a few staffers told us um calls in general have gone up since Trump was elected and had healthcare\nWhich was really a tense time on Capitol Hill with a lot of activism so a lot of these issues this ... this sort of advocacy has become more widespread staffers take issue with it because they say that it doesn't represent constituents fairly\nUm because you know basically advocacy groups are recruiting constituents and then passing them through to their congressmen\nThey agree with them on the subject\nCan you give me a sense of how inundated Congress is right now with these calls and do you have a an idea of how well they're keeping up\nSo it's sort of tough to say because a lot of this data isn't public I've heard from some staffers that it's very similar to health care which was just a very hectic time it's but putting a number on it it's really difficult\nAnd usually it's I I assume low level staffers are taking these these phone calls at first\nYes these are like twenty two to twenty four year olds most of them who take these phone calls\nI'm which can be stressful for them because you know you have Susan Collins is office saying that a lot of their female staffers have been threatened with rape and things like that in in light of the Capitol hearing a lot of\nViolent threats do happen on these phone calls and the staffers or just have to keep up this professional demeanor um when when speaking to these constituents and it depends on what they're actually uh the colors are living in the state or not\nA because senators don't really take into account if it's an outer state color because they want to cater to the people who actually live where they represent\nWhat you're seeing a more organized attempt at an abused daily lose use of phone calls\nSure and one thing that we noticed in reporting this story is that it really happens for a lot of leash political issues like\nI said net neutrality um appropriations bills where basically an organization will like I tell them telemarketer situation happens where they will call up a constituent and say hey how you feel about DACA you think that these immigrants should stay here\nUh what do you think and then the person on the other end of the line will say something usually they're confused\nI'm at which point the telemarketer well past them through the to their member of Congress\nA and confusion I Would say is one of the key giveaways for congressional staffers here because\nThe constituent on the other end of the wind doesn't really know what's happening a lot of the time all they know is that they were called the the conversation oftentimes goes a little bit like hello and and the staff are on the other side is high you've reached the ... the congressman's office um do you need anything\nAnd then the constituent says no you called me and so that sort of ... that sort of confusion really gives away to staffers that this is not as authentic as it with like like the advocacy groups would like for them to think it is\nA other times you know the constituents actually just outright say you know I was told to tell you this\nAnd I actually think that is a one one staffer told me that they had gotten a call one of these pass through calls whereas a constituent had been told to tell them to oppose tax cuts back in the winter\nUp in the constituents had you know they told me to tell you I don't like tax cuts but I used sort of like tax cuts so there's ... there is some room for error and the east coast\nSo there there is some room for error and these calls\nTrial by fire trial by phone from Capitol Hill Weekly Standard reporter Haley bird or we can Ron thanks Haley thank you\nComing up learning in a flood
