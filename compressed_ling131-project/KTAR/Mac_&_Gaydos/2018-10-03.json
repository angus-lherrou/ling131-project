course of you know you know it it it's a bar fight right it's just a bar here's the problem ... not the problem I shouldn't say because if it comes down to Kavanaugh is not good enough for the Supreme Court\nAfter this stupid bar fight allegedly with the leaves the forty and a bad NBA player I don't know what to think of the ... I don't know what to think of the process anymore\nI understand the sex assault allegations I understand the women who have come forward but if we are now trying to figure out every time Kavanaugh got drunk\nAnd the stupid stuff he did because of drinking besides the sex assault stuff don't get me wrong I mean these are tied together I root for many people I ... I did to me they're not though just because you drink and drink a lot does not necessarily mean\nThat you're a sex offender that you're rapist or that you cannot be on the Supreme Court\n[noise] um yeah I I I don't know how far into the past the ... we all figured that the guy drank a lot in high school and college I mean right I mean we figured that out that\nThat he has the ... he drank beer like high school and college and he still does\nRight he likes beer I liked fear still likes beer still likes it um does he have a problem with alcohol I don't know the answer would did\nHe he he doesn't have to be a functioning alcoholics to be or have a problem with alcohol\nI don't know that when I was in college I had my share of beers and we don't drink much anymore\nBut I never got that he is he right right where people say he thought that you know this guy was a famous wrestler and you got into a bar fight thinking this guy this anonymous guy at Syracuse was a famous wrestling you got into an altercation or you blacked out because of the alcohol now I think if\nYou're going to go out and party and you're in college that that shouldn't have anything to do with you being a Supreme Court justice um but I I think what they're trying to find out as if he lied because she's kind of been saying that he's a choir boy and we know that's really not the case\nUm he did like to go out and party he did go out and drink okay that's fine that's one thing but if he drank to the point where he was assaulting women well that's a different point and and that's something obviously about what I think would would disqualify him from being a Supreme Court justice\nBut just because he drank beer doesn't mean he can't be right brain court justice just 'cause he hangs out with Chris Dudley I think I think that should disqualify him from the Supreme Court it's a bad decision or oh oh I mean it's a\nReally bad at all or that he like you'd be forty red red wine and members\nOf my

argument for that detects these midnight writer runners or ...\nYeah [noise]\n\nWait are they talking about the bar fight the town [laughter]\nAnd very welcome [laughter] gee I'm here's the bottom line for me or you can ... you can uh uh the FBI can go and investigate\nThey should uh we could have a vote this week but I think Kavanaugh has already disqualified himself from being a Supreme Court justice and it has nothing to do with allegations of sexual assault 'cause I don't know what happened I Believe Dr Ford over cabin all I Do I Do but but when Kavanaugh went off\nOn how this is a hit job by the Clintons or how the ... the left has done this so he can never he can never be impartial he can't be fair as a judge now because he's got an axe to grind with Democrats\nAnd even though you may say to yourself well he's shown that because he's a federal court judge yes but now his reputation is on the line you don't think he's going to hold a grudge ... you're a failed and they wouldn't hold a grudge\nAnd so what if he got in a bar fight speaking of bar fights what do you think I'd like to know I I think I'd like to know too I'm\nKavanaugh Chris Dudley and you'd be forty gotten a bar

California [noise]\nSenior vice president Dick Clark announced that Amazon is boosting its internal minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour for every worker [noise] no it's on to Washington\nWe certainly hope that we're able to influence Congress and move forward with an increase in the federal minimum wage which\nStands at seven twenty five an hour Amazon has taken criticism for years from employees who described a high stress low morale work environment generally an ABC News\nSo what does this mean simply\nThey're going after the competition and I know that sounds weird because they're raising the minimum wage they're going to pay people to Fifteen bucks an hour right\nBig time what does that made oh my goodness well first they're going to get new ... you know they're gonna find new workers but they're going to put pressure on\nOther companies now to start to do this because Bernie had them in the crosshairs\nHere's a guy that became the poster boy of old it was wrong with America greedy worth a hundred plus billion dollars that the billion dollars Jeff Bezos was his people were complaining about how horrible it is and now\nHim doing this is\nGoing to make everybody go whoa whoa and they're excited about the whole thing\nWith a Fifteen dollars is a place to want to be [noise]\nSo we want to go now so we decided to last November first\nJust in time for the holiday for all our voice [noise]\nYes and in doing so what is going to do is you can put pressure it's going to put pressure on all of these other companies too ashamed truly figure out do we have\nTo jump ahead some of them like Wal Mart and stuff like that we're moving slowly and slowly at eleven dollars here twelve dollars there whatever it was target and things of that nature\nNow you're going to force them to make a choice because you know you got a marketplace that is so massive comparatively to them that you can come at them in ways that they can't this wasn't just say hey let's do a nice thing we'll get Bernie off our back this for all intents and purposes\nPushes other retailers to get on board or face the ire of the likes of a ...\nThe likes of a cost of your Cortez and Bernie Sanders is going to be everybody deserves a living wage\nAt Fifteen dollar minimum this makes us the highest paying a retailer in the country as a ...\nYeah it does and it's more it's just\nI was trying to explain to somebody they what a smart move what a smart move this is because Bernie's been coming for you\nThe left has been coming for you to fight for Fifteen all we hear about is how bad Amazon conditions are and how horrible they are and how evil it is an all of this stuff and now by doing this\nAnd doing it before Congress or somebody else forces you to do something like this it changes so many thing\nIs I'm In favor of higher wages and just making arrests that well look at the business decisions for a good businessman Larry Kudlow right there and yeah he is he's not just a very good businessman he's an amazing businessman and if you can see through a lot of this stuff\nThat it's more than just this\nIt's bigger than just hey we're doing the right thing\nThis gets people off your back essentially as far as the government looking at you and on top of that it forces your competition and Walmart has been competition they bought wished they just bought a big online retailer in uh India that it's going to be massive\nFor them but they're coming in different ways and they've really taken a bite out of Amazon this is going to force them to have to potentially do something or face the you're a bad person\nYour bad company look how much money you have and how other people their lives a horrible because of your three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you know\nThis whole stuff that that that is breaking about you know earlier today at about money and the tax returns and how much money Trump did or didn't get and\nI I don't care isn't it weird you know I don't really\nI don't care some of it is interesting uh how much did he get that he didn't help his father do stuff apparently the investigation says in today's dollars\nHe received about four\nHundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nMuch of it through tax Dodgers and things of that nature and I was I'm always curious about the tax Dodgers were they tax Dodgers where they didn't pay and they illegally did it or did they do the things that they were supposed to do based on the apparatus that you set up in the tax world and because of that\nThey were able to do the things that they needed to do legally\n\nThat's that that that's that's one of those things where you're like oh yeah and I really thought of it like that 'cause you set it up that way I didn't set it up that way you\nAnd if you set it up that way and I'm able to beat you at your game that's on you you make the rules not may people always want to see his tax returns I I don't care about Hillary's tax returns I didn't I didn't even care about the Clinton Foundation tax returns I didn't care about any of that stuff right I Know I and I know\nMaybe I'm naive or just I'm at the point where I just this is part of that cynicism I Believe it is what it is and uh you know these people they the I've got a lot of friends who were in the business I get letters I got some friends who are are\nFairly famous and the way that they set things up would amaze\nYou they scream it's all about fairness and I will tell you this the way that they play games with they set up foundations they pay themselves have dollar a year and they skirt the there's so many people out there that do a lot of things like that and it's not that it's illegal it just for the average person it seems like oh they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing\nNo we're more they are whoever's playing by the rules they're playing by the rules\nThat were set up and they didn't set 'em up\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three actually had been some shows your Twitter was talking about tribalism and the second more

awaiting the report from the FBI the FBI report could be released two senators\nAre as early as tonight does this mean Brett Kavanaugh has nothing to worry about should we be concerned let's talk to Steve Gomez right now NBC News contributor and a retired FBI special agent Steve thanks for taking the time out we certainly appreciate how are you today\n[noise] good good good afternoon to everybody\nYou know we talk to the other day and you give us some great insight on what the FBI was doing how they could actually of thirty thousand of their you know agents working on this case what do you think what is your gut tell you it looks like the FBI is completed the investigation since they finished early is that actually a good sign for Brett Kavanaugh\nProbably I I think it is because in the and the reason especially if he and Dr Ford were not interviewed I think it's a good sign for him because that means that the FBI conducted interviews of the people that were identified by Dr Ford in her allegation\nAnd they probably did not find any information from those interviews that was new that uh that added to her allegation or cooperated it um if anything they probably didn't have any information to provide one way or the other\nAnd ... and again this is the probability not knowing exactly what came out of those interviews but that's probably what it looks like based on the fact that a cabin on and for didn't get interviewed and now it looks like the investigations wrapped up\nHow do you not interview cabin on for I don't get it\n[noise] well if we saw their testimony under oath in front of the the committee and a and and that testimony was very powerful it um we we heard what his side of the story was and we heard what her side of the story was and so at that point\nIf you just look at it from those two people\nIt's a he said she said so to speak ... so they need corroborating evidence statements something to\nAdd to the allegation or take away from the allegation and so if they don't get any of that\nFrom the uh the witnesses that were identified than they could they could basically take their testimony as that's their statement now for me personally I I might have liked to have sat down with Dr Ford especially\nAnd the reason from ... from our I look at it is a when ... when I was in the FBI I worked a number of cases threats allegations things of that nature uh when it comes to public corruption and terrorism you we're always looking at the allegation that came in\nAnd what was the motive of the person who made that allegation why did they make that was it was there some hidden agenda was there's some hidden motive and the only way you can determine that is you do a bit of an investigation to establish that person's credibility and their motivation and sometimes you have to sit down and talk to them\nAnd and really go through why they made that allegation now you only you only can do that if you do it another follow up interview with them now they may not be looking at it from that standpoint they may say listen we're just trying to determine that\nIs trying to determine the background of\nJudge Kavanaugh and uh and if there is no cooperative evidence then you know the case as close as far as they're concerned with regard to the allegations and they're not going to go in an interview judge a you know just Kevin\nOr Dr Ford because at that point they already know what their statement is based on the hearing so that that's how I that's what my guts telling me based on what I'm what I'm seeing and and you know and if the if it is wrapping up um that's just my opinion I think that that might be what's happening I could be wrong that could be something more to it\nAll eight hundred and go truly or is it truly know win dot com now to get a one hundred dollars off tour bike control guys [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo the FBI supposedly is wrapping up its investigation the me too movement has had a profound effect on almost every facet of of our culture of our\nNation including the the nomination of a Supreme Court justice but does this also mean that you should go back into your maybe childhood and adolescence and the movies that you saw as a kid maybe you don't share with your children now because well it's a different time now\nHow about some of the eighties movies ah director John Hughes some of the greatest movies you know that we're ever made I mean mind a generation\nSo sixteen candles sixteen candles\nMolly Ringwald a there is a a scene in this movie for example the boy that ring worlds character has a crush on\nPonders taking advantage of his girlfriend who was passed out following a party at his house member Jake Ryan that was the guy's name here's a clip\n\nViolet her in ways\nThat makes them that's that's that's that sounds awful right that makes my skin crawl right so\nWhat do you have to do what do you why do you edit do you now go\n... and then on the DVD or the no no no you don't do that at your own home now\nBut there have been songs that have been re re release without certain words guns and roses had a song and they had the N. word in it the other derogatory word for for gays\n... uh that's been edited out a and whose\nDecision should that be should it be guns and roses decision should it be John Hughes oh wait a minute he's not on yeah or Molly Ringwald Molly Ringwald said recently that she was aware and was uncomfortable with certain scenes in sixteen candles and this is what you said just the other day\nIt's a difficult
