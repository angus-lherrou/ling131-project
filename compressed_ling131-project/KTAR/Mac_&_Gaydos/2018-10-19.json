think the people that actually watched the debate\nAre you know they tried and true really informed voters and I think that it was motivating to her base have Republicans to point out you know just how extreme or cares on a permissive language ... important subjects\nBut there are a voting for her Emily that's the thing independence I think they see that treason thing and they say yeah I really don't believe that cures in cinema he's anti soldier she's got two brothers in the ... in ... in the military you\nYeah I really don't believe that curious in cinema he's anti soldier she's got two brothers in the ... in ... in the military you\nKnow share of it because that's going to get you know I think a lot of the people you're going to poll or even people that show up and vote didn't watch that debate so they're getting the soundbite and you're deciding based on sound bite and and I can see where some of the pennant or moderate voters banquet that\nCan't be right but you know there's a

we've kind of stuck by is that it's going to come down to independent voters\nDoes make Sally need to change your tone a little or or change your message a little in order to persuade independent

people you're looking at roughly thirty that aren't going to get a\nHigh that's a K C A R reporter Jim Cross out in Mesa we chatted with him earlier today you can let five thousand people in the

three fifty today the presidential event\nParking is now capacity ... there will be no alternative parking available\nIf you're not there by now I guess ... ... or will take the light oh night Trump is making the light ... he's not you know that's not right now he's now by shop or maybe I he will take a chopper from I think Scottsdale Airport\nYeah to Luke air force and then he'll grab a lift and no no no he will take the shuttle no I'll take it he'll take the helicopter air marine one yeah then to the Mesa gateway airport but I gotta I gotta be honest I didn't expect ten thousand people viscerally I didn't expect\nI thought yeah five seven thousand people crowd you know that I didn't expect more than ten thousand people I wouldn't\nI mean and again forty thousand people having showed up Jim crosses telling us that's what might possibly have with her and that's a huge crowd that is a major as a monster crowd right but let's remember where this Web this venue is too I mean there's a lot of room out there\nYou can you go in and you can see Trump but that's five thousand that's room for four maybe five thousand people inside the yang side but outside you got you got a lot of room a earlier today cheaper ... or spoke to a Bruce and Pamela about you know how they are preparing\nFor president Donald Trump and how they're preparing for supporters and protesters\nWe've created two large large free speech zone where folks can make their own determination about what side of the aisle they want to stand in\nSee I think they should just have one big cage and let one Trump supporter in in one Trump protestor in and just let them let them let 'em have it just let them at each other by one oh you do I do on line one okay about attacking you get to Trump's supporters and into a protesters let 'em in the cage he wouldn't have been already making like a WWE pay per view of it\nI don't think anybody's going to pay for the ... oh there's no Delhi's but he's also a was talking about the type of venue Trump is coming to\nFeel that we're so fortunate that we have the of it\nOh there's no Delhi's but he's also a was talking about the type of venue Trump is coming to\nI feel that we're so fortunate that we have the of it out at Phoenix lasik the airport because it's so large large venue the parking lot in it of itself is very expensive I think we can probably fit for five six thousand cars between the three large large parking areas that are that are designated out there\nAnd I'm not saying that it's over and not know that either definitely not but it's not do see Garcia where you can say it's over for for David go see it that's over but there is now separation and cures didn't cinema has has gone down this particular road\nAnd I think it will pay off now whether mix Sally changes in midstream we'll see we'll see what she does\nYou listen to the big forward for we bring you for big blockbuster stories to start the four o'clock hour\nMeans for for\nThe stores\nAs being south as of this woman by Mexico\nSo we appreciate very much what Mexico so but as of this moment you see what's happening is thinks that\nPresident Trump in Scottsdale today's talking about that caravan that's headed towards the United states from Honduras\nOr I have heard a couple of different things [noise]\nThat this caravan of almost four thousand people has kind of split apart some got into Mexico some\nTurned around and headed back\nHome yeah the the initial reports that we were getting is that Mexico sent riot police down to the border between Mexico and Guatemala and they were only going to allow people with visas or some kind\nOf a paper okay visa or documentation basically they're going to allow them through everybody else had to be turned away\nThen what we saw it through reports is that a lot of people were being turned away\nAnd then the groups are the caravan group stormed the border gate yeah to cross into Mexico they overpowered police who were there carrying their children carrying babies as they basically ran for it before the Mexican police\nCould catch up to them I think Trump has done a pretty good job on this story actually this this situation it's not a story situation\nYou've got people who live in a very poor part of the world there are gangs their drugs it's a very dangerous part of the world and they're trying to get their families out but here's the thing\nA Donald Trump has thrown a bunch of stuff out there we're going to stop aid to Guatemala Honduras were getting on Mexico and they're gonna they better do something that's well yeah he's he's threatening Mexico you guys better stop this\nAnd so far I think it's partially worked so I think the president has to throw a bunch of stuff out there he's gotta kinda threaten everybody and he's got to get people to do their job and say don't let them into Mexico and the first place because if they get into Mexico then they're going to walk through our front door yeah in Arizona and Texas\nMexico seems to be the last the last stop if if if you want to call it that way have to make sure that people\nAre coming through the you know the ... I I don't know what the right term is ... but they're the ones that can be the stopgap if they get into the United states the laws and the and the procedures you can't deny them you're listening to the big Ford for\n... for for the story for [noise]\nThis one's over Denver wins that forty five to ten\nThat was a Thursday Night Football\nOn Fox of course I was ... but it was a\nHard nose loss on national television on a Thursday night they were embarrassed they were humiliated the season is over a and they fired their office of coordinate right MIke McCoy\nWho was atrocious\nI don't know what else they do I don't I I I've heard finished the season ...
