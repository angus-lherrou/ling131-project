what I've been told all day long that you saying you're a nationalist means essentially you are\nAn option that's just it right doesn't matter how you spend it he's a Nazi period case closed so I said to myself self let's get the best definition of nationalist and what it is\nAll right this is according to miss him Webster a loyalty a devotion to a nation especially a sense of national

we get here because\nBe there because I Do think it's the right thing to do especially when you have an opportunity to go and do something else plus in this day and age I always think it's a good thing to do the kids see that guess what you're not the center of the world other kids are out there\nThey're going to be the set of the world sometimes to the fact that they can find it thirty plus

CNN got an explosive device governor here's the thing obviously if I blame the idiots who did this okay the guys at all and disgusting but\nI mean the language used by both parties in this mid term election\nI think that there are also partly responsible for this do you disagree or agree\nPresident junk came out with and they're very strong message today that absolutely under no conditions is that type of behavior that it'd be tolerated in common despicable and the parties need to unify on both sides and stuff all that so I think we're going to see it\nComing across from everyone that we we have to stop this environment it's so easy to edge that it is explosive no pun intended enthusiasm of course there's always buying in their First Amendment as we talk about but terrorism\nIs totally totally unacceptable from whomever I don't care who you are because our country we are the are in that statement\nListen Trump like some mouthed off that's what he does then you've got that

are wackos out there that watch all this they get totally incited by it and now we got a guy who wants to bomb the Clintons Obama and CNN\nAbsolutely as on both sides I mean we've got you know Hillary

and I mean while you were governor you were also in politics for a long time have you ever had something sent to you that caused an alarm like this have you ever had to deal with something like this\nWell you know I had to think back in my mind that I remembered\nThat when I was in the Senate and we were in the middle of that Governor and the ... and H meant there was a pipe bomb placed in my yard that exploded walk on um\nI went out to the back I was just here by myself with my youngest son and we went out in the back to luckily ... see anything and I was in a hurry so I went in and put my purse down in the house and about four minute the Glendale police\nWere out in my house the neighbors had called the police and they had the bomb and they had the bomb squad car and then they

there to see Bernie versus David Garcia I don't think there were many people there to see David Garcia there's not a lot of excitement for David Garcia Bernie well he's still he's still got some excitement he still has passion\nIf if you can break out three additional people that one thousand votes with David suddenly becomes for thousands boats and I don't want them\nI don't want to math

sent\nTheir bombs they were sent to the Clintons sent to the Obamas CNN received a package are you are you seen the similarity\nDemocrats were sent bombs\nYeah not Jay and not just politicians Iraq's former attorney general\nA former ... former I'm a a person a with a lot of money in the Democratic party or ... or supports the Democrats are already Soros yeah George Soros so there is a disturbing pattern and devices in New York as well as D.C\nA what a sources are saying is they are all constructed using a digital clock they were built with PVC pipe containing enhancements\nTo cause more damage there has\nTo be a ... what is called a fingerprint or an imprint on these bombs that will help hopefully you would think these people to to catch whoever did this\nUm CNN Live on the air and an alarm goes off in the back you'll often\nSee in bombs uh terrorists use in Afghanistan elsewhere ISIS has use that kind of on four dozen minutes exclusive\nOr just to those kinds of terrorist groups but that is a difficulty development\nAnd all that noise in the background meant it out of the building right so they had to go to break I don't have to go to a break and then you know I don't know what they came back with but ah\nThey did some of their broadcast from out on the street yeah they got a cameraman and the person down on the street outside of the CNN building in ... in New York\nBut again this is ... this is something that I\nDon't blame one side or the other okay it is both sides and make no mistake about this this is not just will trumps of you know Trump is not the the the be all end all there are there's blame on both sides it goes back years and hopefully they'll catch this guy so persons before another bomb us\nAll end all there are there's blame on both sides it goes back years and hopefully they'll catch this guy so persons before another bomb is sent and maybe explode\nSo what you're saying is the hate speech on both sides I hate the left I hate the rights and they go at it and they call each other names that has what escalate escalated to the point where some guy out there right says I'm going to build bombs and I'm going to send it to mostly one party correct a president Donald Trump today in these times\nI mean do we want seven thousand people just to walk into the United states no no some of them are going to be able to do we ... we ... we have to realize that we need stronger border enforcement yes but don't play the fear\nCard that hey we don't know who these people are they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime oh and now let's add Middle Eastern what's next there's some Martian Martians or going to colonize the United states and take it so are all seven thousand people good people know of course not but you can round up that's wrong word\nYou can sample seven thousand people in Phoenix and you're not going to get nice are good people either right oh\nSo the good thing that Trump is doing is well he's threatening you know Honduras Guatemala and eat you have to do that I don't want him to cut aid off he said he wants to do that but that would just make the problems worse and more people will come here but to threaten it I get to ... to call Mexico and say you have to stop them before they get here\nWhy don't you guys all from silence I get old then I get all that but there are you cannot come out as the president United States and say yeah there there are there some ah there's a Middle Eastern middle Easterners\nWe can't let them in I have good information he's he's what there's no proof that that that that's a four year old logic writes four year old watch come on All right you're listening to the big forward for for big blockbusters story starts at four o'clock out\nSome big for for the story for\nMe the election of Kavanaugh\nTax cuts and common sense we got it [laughter]\n\nAll right President Trump saying this is the election of several things including Brett Kavanaugh\nNow we have a poll\nThe Kavanaugh effect does it boosts Democrats [noise] more or just a boost Republicans I to me I had no idea where this whole would end I'm sure Trump didn't either\nAt least in this USA Today poll the cabinet effect says that\nBoost Democrats yeah well I don't believe that more than six intense likely voters say Kavanaugh's confirmation after facing allegations of sex assault makes them more likely to vote one party or the other K. and that gives the boost to Democrats\nI think Trump is right is\nThis election about having all the midterms yes is it about the caravan yes he's put out some ah some some idea of putting a a tax cut for the middle the middle of the middle class I don't know if it's about that\nWell I'd I'd like to know who these people are are they are the ... release hold yeah are they are they Democrat leaning Republican leaning if they if they if they got an let's say a majority are more of\nA Democrats well of course Cavanaugh I mean the Kavanaugh nomination was divided even in Congress by party lines it was the closest vote ever\nAnd it was again a mostly along party lines so I Would understand if you have eight Democrats\nFifty Republicans and it's mostly going to sway Democrats to vote against you know whatever okay but they don't say it in that poll just be surprising if if Republicans that said oh I Can't vote for Republicans because again\nThis poll also said a forty percent of people say that the confirmation of cabinet didn't affect my vote at all\nMaybe it's not in there or maybe that's not the issue maybe they have other
