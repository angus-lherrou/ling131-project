as well like represent\nLet me ask you this ms Hoffman she's the Democrat or a school superintendent when you said we don't want to expand maybe we don't place more what is the school that would need a resource officer in your definition of what would be criteria beach to play somebody there\nAreas that we have already identified as having greater numbers of at Redskins and potentially gang violence\nOkay follow up for Frank rigs he's a Republican what do you think of as Hoffman's\nCounselors first we need to get cancer was in school they get to know the children they know if there's some type of problem is that a better avenue to go down then to put a resource officer with a firearm in school there to protect them is that a good argument if you have a councilor\nKnow every ... also I've ever known including my wife\nIs a really good councilor the very first thing you learn as a police officers your most effective tool is your mouth you you learn how to read people you learn how to counsel and advice people but in fairness you don't have a master's degree in counseling adult Colorado but here's a here's here's the issue Jones\nThe fact the matter is is is yet a neither one of the false dichotomy in the whole debate about K. twelve education everything gets conflated\nYeah well if you're for SRO somehow you're against school counselors that's not the case you can be for good district schools and good charter schools you can value the education profession and parental choice and you can want counselors\nAnd school resource officers and I'm just going to say but this Hoffman's position on this or oh this is the exact reason why a week ago I received the endorsement so the Arizona Police Association the Arizona fraternal order of police in Maricopa County attorney bill Montgomery so often you get the last as you say on the resource officers were running out of time\nWell I'm not surprised that the police association would endorse him considering his background as a police officer I Am very proud to have the endorsement of all the teacher organizations as well as the Arizona Republic\nAnd most recently on very proud to have the endorsement of the newspaper and press get the daily courier because that's the only Democrat that they endorse because they know how important it is to have an educator leading the department of education and I look forward to doing that with your support\nRight and that was from earlier today a Mac and getting those giving you the school superintendent smackdown both the Democrat and Republican candidates Kathy hopping and Frank rigs in Studio I'm running for ... a state superintendent and I'll tell you this they will do either one of them will be a huge improvement over the disaster of dying to\nI I I totally agree uh it comes down to approach yes as far as school resource officers would I what I'm hearing what I'm interpreting Riggs is more a reactive somebody threatens the campus there is somebody that can protect the kids\nHoffman is more proactive of let's get these kids help before they decide oh I'll get a gun and come on the campus and and whatever but both of them are about school safety both of them want to do best for Arizona kids it's up to you who side you like but I gave him a tremendous amount of props for coming in at the same time\nAnd hash it out and many people many candidates won't they won't do that they were actually together at a school the other day yes in ... so yeah I mean they have different approaches\nBut I think it's fair to say they really want what's best for the kid right I Know they're politicians now and you know you can't really charts politicians and all that kind of stuff but here's our choice we got either one or the other ... and I think they're both going to be\nAnd now and you know you can't really touch politicians and all that kind of stuff but here's our choice we got either one or the other right and I think they're both

stupid and stupid will do stupid things\nYeah I agree with that um and and I would agree that maybe some people don't really understand that you know that they don't understand ... theater you know but those are the people got to watch out for it because those are the ones that might take action than the rest of us might not light\nAnd here's the thing the bomb the ... like 'cause you never talking about the bomb stuff and I and I was thinking about this uh and and as I was talking to several people left in the right ah that that we talk all the time about stuff like this is\nIt doesn't matter who sent it if it was a hoax or if it was you know a a crazy right winger that wants to support Trump and is going after the enemies whatever it doesn't matter what matters is somebody\nHas some serious issues and we're too busy trying to blame each other and protect our side that we're missing the entire pointed\nThis absolutely and I think that that applies to and I'm probably going to get crucified for this to it that applies to the left and the right as you have people on the right saying oh it's all a democratic ... people on the left saying oh you know you know Republicans or conservatives are stupid\nNo you're you're both in the wrong here this this is serious stuff and you have to investigate it and if it turns out to be a hoax well okay you can sit there and say I told

the things that people don't tell you and truck came out and said something today that needed to be said that\nThis and this is one of the things that people do tell you and Trump came out and said something today\nThat needed to be said that wasn't being said we hear all the time about a socialized medicine is great right we can debate that all day long or we can talk about socialized medicine but what are the things that socialized medicine gets that ah people don't talk about\nIs the fact that quite frankly they're enjoying a lot of what we do the world\nRapes the benefits of American Genius and innovation well American citizens and especially our great seniors who are hit the hardest\nPick up the tab but no longer yeah so we come up with all these great things we come up with these things and what ends up happening\nIs Europe benefits by paying virtually nothing for them we're not even paying we were paying retail times ten and that is not good we're paying ... we're paying extra retail like super extra retail and that's my frustration it really has\n[noise] well no I wouldn't say that the Europeans are paying next to nothing I mean are are they paying like half of their incomes and taxes to have their free health care yeah today they're paying for\n... yes yes they are they are paying for it in a way but as far as if they had to develop their own drugs instead of picking back that would cost them even more\nAnd therein lies the the craziness of it so something that may cost you let's just throw round number out here a thousand dollars over there they're going to be able to get it for a hundred bucks or two hundred bucks and that's\nThat's all the money is being made here and then the savings are passed on to the rest of the world and that's the frustration and the dirty little secret that people don't talk\nAbout well that's true we do develop a lot of the world's medications but what what really gets me about all these drug prices is and I have personal experience with this you're right we pay retail times ten but\nWhen I have an issue with is all these drug companies are you know most of their role ingredients come from Europe and other places worldwide they pay maybe what two cents on the dollar for them and then they're charging us this money [laughter]\nIt's not it's crazy and that is so I have to agree with you I I agree with this drug bill yeah the president signed and\nI like the fact that a taking on opioids you do know this and we don't talk about it because it's not sexy and in this world is you know you cover what's hot if it bleeds it leads and that's that's the reality of the world and Trump is big news and bombs and things are more interesting\nThan this but this will affect more people's life than what's going on a lotta times\nAbsolutely and with seniors especially especially those on fixed incomes or someone who has a Medicare part D program where they have what's called the do not they go up to a certain point and then it's not covered for a while and then they have to wait for a certain period of time I think that's going to help those people even more especially the ones on low fixed income\nHuge huge speaking of Medicare open enrollment now a Mac company I work with\nSuspicion mature American citizens right now they're giving you a year free if you're over the age of fifty
