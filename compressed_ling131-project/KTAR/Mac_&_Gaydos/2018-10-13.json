digits in the latest poll is there any way you can come back and when\nI'm currently not I I think the race is over you know in its early ballots go out tomorrow the early ... the race has already overdue for one month\nReally so [laughter] so no chance whatsoever you can't do anything to do to kind of get the numbers back to single digits or home waved yeah yeah do you can trust the polls though\nWhat you know we learned a powerful lesson about how Ron Paul can be and twenty sixteen than the way\nUm but you know more than just the ... are really poorly run campaign like are you at camp and as we get closer to election day the lead that Governor DC is actually growing which in the wrong track Garcia and it would take an October surprise\nAnd by that I mean a really bad shocking that have news about governor juicy and the money tell that story for Garcia to hold him down in numbers to make any ground and I don't see it happening\nI don't see it happening either a David Garcia has run a campaign\nYou know we were supposed to have him on Wednesday and they canceled on us Monday for no reason really whatsoever there's only like less than thirty days left to the election I mean if this guy doesn't want to come on the biggest talk show and you know did his point across maybe he doesn't know what this point is and that's why he's staying away from the media but we offered him an\nHour on the air and the guy said yes and then he backed out so I you know it makes me think they don't know what the heck they're doing over the Garcia campaign\nYeah I have to agree with you you

this would be ... and they just squandered\nIt but how good Tim there's got to be the last to die in Douglas a couple of years ago I mean dying Douglas is one of the worst politician we know why she

and talk about in person he's probably really shaking their head right now it's friend involved he's probably think and why didn't I weighed ... but yeah it it's just been a missed opportunity\nFor them and you know he he's a nice man when you meet Mr Garcia he's a he's a nice man in person she looks good on paper but they cannot pull that off\nWe're talking with Emily Ryan she's a political consultant with ... consulting group right here in the valley I David Garcia said he's counting on hidden votes to win the election we're we're still not sure what that means what is a hidden vote\n[laughter] you know that's not an industry term then that might be a new to their campaign but I think what he's probably referring to cross over voters ah maybe people who haven't\nVoted in a long time but he can pull from the Republican Party over to his side or movie from the independent center swath of voters by you know if you're going to do that you can't run as they alter progressive accident like who wants to open the border\nWhen I I don't get the strategy the one thing that\nThat is the one thing that that I didn't understand uh about Garcia or about\nAbout governor ... how do you get the independent vote how do you unless you just stay pretty\nPretty much in your lane I'm Russian well with with Garcia and as soon as he said imagine no wall on the southern border you there's no way of coming back from that have to see how we're just relies on hey I got teachers money and the economy looks great well well that's going to appeal to independent voter I guess\nThe ... best of our Arizona's news station a TA or Ninety two three of them\nAre new scene was covering a story and it seems that about for goodness four to seven hundred asylum seekers were being released by ice into Arizona now we had governor Doug do see on yesterday he commented on this will play those clips free in a second\nBut but let's kind of explain what took place in Arizona a yesterday to the church there's a church here in the valley actually their churches all over Arizona that are now starting to take in a these are these people some of them\nHave families some of the children all by themselves um\nLittle shutter rocky United Church of Christ has taken in people that are looking for sanctuary already\nAnd they have a number of people that have been there for a while but what ISIS done ice has released a statement saying that we just don't have the space and so we can't we can't keep these people\nSo we send them the churches and the churches are like hey we're used to getting like maybe two or five or ten not over a hundred\nYeah these are families that have requested asylum right which is different than people who are here illegally over the border ... looking for work right uh I think if you obviously if you're if you're seeking asylum you're looking to continue to live\nYou you think you're going to be dead in Honduras you're going to get get get killed in Guatemala you think your your life is going to end so you leave your country of origin and you try and come to the United states and seek asylum\nSo Brazil does he know was sent down to the shadow rock United Church of Christ she joins us now to Katie a our news reporter uh the only English speaking a station that was there actually and Griselda as as you know as a reporter I Know you have to remain objective but you came back yesterday\nAnd you were telling us some stories that really affected us ... tell us some of the stories and some of the things you saw yesterday at this church with these asylum seekers who we're getting off the bus\nRight so as a reporter you know you can go in there and you put on your reporter hat and you're there to collect the facts or bring back the information and kind of describe what happened but it's stories like this that makes it hard to go in without reporter mentality on you know you just can't help\nBut feel empathy for these individuals especially me as an ex mother um you know I see all these kids getting off the buses and it just hits you of\nHow a treasure as their journey must have been to get here and why why they're coming here\nAnd a lot of these kids that we're getting off the bus yesterday lifted very scared\nOr that you know they were volunteers there that were there to greet them and to make them feel welcomed and to kind of get rid of some of that fear that you signed these kids face is that he's still saw that fear in their ... and the kisses faces and it just it it just got to me and and and it wasn't just me\nUm I saw a lot of the volunteers tearing up on you know it does\nA lot of these kids didn't have parents right they were not being supervised or the worst supervise it was like one adult to like eight kids right\nRight I I Would say a lot of these kids were there with their parents how they work a lot of them were there with their parents and um you know that you you could tell that they were kind of really close to their their parents trying to stay as close to them as possible um but yeah you you could just see the fear in their faces\nI I think it's sad I think when you see a people that are fleeing from a very you know desperate and dangerous situation a and they think the United states well we can we can claim asylum there is the first of all the\nUm the the the journey from ... whatever you know Central American country that they came from all the way to the United states that's brutal trip and then you get here and\nYou know I I I Would hope that they're being treated well\nUh we've heard you know some some really terrible stories that they're not treated very well but but I I think it's interesting result when you were watching and I saw your video hum\nAnd you weren't you are taking a video but you weren't shooting their faces yeah and so I'm watching this and I'm watching all these little legs get off get off the bus and ... and there were a couple that we're all by themselves and I'm Glad that you said that most of them in where their parents and I'm like man I don't know if I could have watched that that would have been tough for me\nIt was hard to watch their faces and and see a you know the uncertainty of what's going to happen to them on a and one of the things that the ...\nIn one of the things that the church members that I spoke with told me is that\nThey are used there they have experience with this so they weren't going to be giving a that the children teddy bears to help uh you know with that and with that fear\nUm but yeah like you said these people have gone to treacherous journey and they've gone through so many different things to get here and\nUm they're feature in the U.S remains uncertain are a lot of them are seeking asylum a lot of them are from what they might not is what I was told\n'em ... it's on certain what can happen to them\nI I Know that the the church is overwhelmed do they want people to help out do do they want the public's assistance or no\nRight now they said that they do have all the things that they need right as okay yeah so they they sent out a message to their church members on two different organizations that they partner with and um they said they have everything that they need as of right\nNow okay that's great because others a teen oh KTLA or a news reporter covering the story where ice has said because of the surge people are still coming here we can't house these people so these people\nThe only thing the federal government gives them is a travel voucher and that's it they are released hopefully to a church hopefully to a center where then they can go and contact their families if they don't have families I don't know where they go\nBut they stay in America or to go through the process of asylum which means that go to court\nOr and then they see where it goes from there but uh we you know we got a tip yesterday that this was happening because ice of course doesn't want to promote this uh but it's forty seven hundred people right now that are being released area churches in the valley in ... in Tucson and it could be more down the road\nSo how how are you looking at this not you Mac but everybody else out there how are you looking at this as a we're all humans and we all want to be safe and we don't want to give her kids are home or you go and political on it everything is political these days everything is this going to turn into a political football how many of you out there thinking\nWell already is because of the president they can't be here we can't help everybody I mean how many people were going through the process right okay but but you know I just I I I think you've got to have some sympathy for these families because I said it for a while\nThis is an um sneaking in the United states because their economy is great and I'm going to a I'm not going to do with the right way I'm just going to sneak in and I'm going to work and I'm going to send all my money back to Mexico it's really not what's happening here you have people that are escaping um gangs and drugs and violence\nSo I Do think it's different I Know we can't you know why does the other day why does Arizona have to how seven hundred asylum seekers why why were we picked over all these other states just because we're we're on the border that ...\nThat's it it's proximity were the closest to the southern border okay and so I mean there are people that are sent to other states but Texas New Mexico California and Arizona are going to be the ones that absorb a most of these ... asylum seekers [laughter]\nDoes best of our ... our news Ninety two to three of them hey smack\nWatson for my friends are renters warehouse it used to be when you move you call it a

make sure that they don't have any outstanding warrants from other countries or don't have any obvious criminal records from other countries before they are ordered released and a lot of them do end up with ankle monitors to monitor them\nSo they are claiming asylum here how effective or their clinch\nWell about eighty to Ninety percent of those who go to the border to an agent or a port of entry and ask for asylum eighty to Ninety percent of those according to the director up are found to have valid claims of asylum and get our number what that is a very high number\nBut do they all move forward and debt asylum for now the show up at their court hearing\nIt you know and that sort of the you know how can you know for sure that they are going to find out asking that question he says

and move\nForward only two percent actually ever get repatriated to their country meaning they get removed from the U.

[noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or at least for me that he said he said man who's not afraid\nFlipping roasting radio show at its new time Saturdays at noon right here on cable news nuggets ... three of them [noise]\n\n\nNa na na da dun dun dun dun dun dun dun than\nWe are this is money matters with Ken ... but of course I Am your host can rewrite\n[noise]\nThank you ... that was the ... that theme song you heard there if you recognize that that is from the old TV series bonanza and this show we are the bonanza of the airwaves we share with you the gold and now it's a financial information every week I wrote that I'm proud of it as bad as it was I take full responsibility [noise] um\nAnd about [noise] I Know it depends\nOn how it is very silly incredibly silly [noise] so uh as I was saying I had been a a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talked about with our beloved and most valued clients\nWe not work with over a thousand four hundred beautiful families and we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so that's where our focus is and so therefore all the things that uh you know in that arena we want to help people with\nAnd that we're we're blessed to be able to do that and in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisor for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers and once again without our clients we would be nowhere so you guys thank you thank you thank you I'm\nOne of the views that we have philosophically of how we help our clients so when it comes to financial advising you know you you you invest money obviously that's part of what you do is you want to help your clients with their investments diversification risk profiles all that kind of stuff but\nThen that's that's a a component of it but there's more okay because there's also you want to help to build a cash flow plan right you want to look at how you're going to get income when you're retired and then you want to have a risk assessment so if you're doing proper plant up financial planning in my opinion\nYou need to look at the risk that your client is going to face during their retirement and you want to build a plant around that to address the risk that you think they are most likely to face and if you do that because the word plan right we planned for the worst and hope for the best\nUh that's how we operate so uh and believe it or not there are Eighteen risks that you face\nOkay when you're retired it's probably more but but there's a there's a team that that we that we look at okay and so we can talk about number six this week which is frailty risk and what I mean my frailty risk\nIt's it's the result of deteriorating mental or physical health okay so this is when a person is not able to make sound judgment in managing their financial affairs or they may be unable to take care of themselves at their home so\nYou know and this is kind of a not a fun topic obviously but ah at University of Michigan study shows that one third of the people over the age of sixty five suffer from frailty\nAnd so therefore frailty in retirement is a real risk and and you know even though we don't want to think about these kinds of things\nAs your financial advisor my job is to do that okay so it and and the problem with it is it impacts people early in retirement because a third of people over the age of sixty five according to study or have frailty a third okay so\nAnd the majority of retirees will suffer from frailty at some point during the retirement now in ah in England they did a study which shows that the longer you are retired\nThe more your mental health decreases so working longer can help hold off frailty\nSo therefore the risk of frailty can be exacerbated and if you retire if you you know and a lot of people strive to retire early well guess what don't\n[laughter] okay you don't want to do that so uh ... uh one risk as being asked to retire by your company earlier than you had planned right and the increased cost and all that so here's some solution so first of all\nUh make sure you know who in the case if you do have any issues there um who's going to step in and make those decisions and do that for you okay so is it a family member or you're going to hire a financial advisor and you know we have quite a few clients\nWho have come in and told us that the reason you know for example ... it's a generational thing obviously uh but uh people in their sixties right now for the most part the husband handled the financial affairs\nAnd a lot of the husbands are concerned that if something happened to them that their wife would not be able to handle the finances as well as they did 'cause they kinda did the whole thing\nAnd so if if the husband or whoever the CFO for the family is is then or now not able to what's going to happen next so\nWe have quite a few clients who are with us simply because they want to have an establish relationship now\nGiving someone control is done normally through a power of attorney so you want to have the power of attorney that gives somebody the power to make financial decisions for you in the event that you are not able to um and that's called a durable power of attorney\nYou might also consider having living trust okay because what a living trust does it names a trustee\nAnd so therefore if you are incapable of continuing as trustee you've already named who's going to step in and what the rules are et cetera so this is a very good second option in and one that we recommend in in a lot of states I'm now you also in the pre planned the documents that describe the\nThings that would cause you to be incompetent okay so you want to have in their ... activities of daily living and ... and therefore uh this is called the guardianship document which basically spells out\nYou know not the financial decisions that need to be made but who's going to feed you drive you you know all those kinds of things again this isn't a pleasant topic I Know but if you're gonna be financially sound I think you need to think about all the things that could impact you negatively and if you have that taken care of if you plan to head for that\nThen you know hopefully it won't happen but if it does it doesn't you know devastate your situation All right I don't know how to say I think we accept anything yet so a couple of more tips one is make sure your finances are simplified you know we tell clients you consolidate things make it easy for others to be able to find it all\nYou know if you have stuff spread out over Seventeen different custodians and you've got accounts all over the place that's fine for you because you're smart and you've got your spreadsheet and your little list and all that\nBut can others recreate what you've done probably not and so you know do them a favor consolidated all that stuff simplify it and make it easy for somebody else to step in and take over the responsibilities\nAnyway now that's a risk number six and I hope that helps you know again we have all the risks are the first five or

listen\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI'm In our for ever [noise] and we are back does money matters with Kendall rape and of course I Am your host ...\n[noise] thank\nYou Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our love it and most valued clients\nAnd now we we're not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is a a just a an honor and privilege\nAnd we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so most of our focus is on the retirement planning and so is this show and so that's you then we're here for you\nEnd up for the second year in a row now money matters with Ken ... that would be our firm is a finalist were finalists or ... or the two thousand Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch awards for ethics which has a mouthful\nBut basically uh we are up for it for the second year in a row as an award winner for the better Business Bureau toward toward for ethics [noise]\nYes and oh the winners will be announced November first at the awards ceremony and I'll tell you whether we win it or not but we're\nUm I think honored adjusted to be in the running to win it which is a a good thing because you know in our business I think ethics in in all businesses but particularly in our business I think ethics are very very important [noise]\nAnyway um we're going to talk now about the foundational philosophy that we have when we manage our clients money is because we are financial advisors as I mentioned\nAnd one of the functions that we perform for our clients as we manage their money for them and what we tell them is you know that uh we're going to take care of we're going to manage your money for you your job is to go and take a cruise okay we love you but get outta here [laughter] see you later takeoff go go be be gone\nAnd we want you to not even think about your finances we want you to enjoy and we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nWe love you\nAnd I love you back and so you know we want our clients to be out there having fun and enjoying whatever they think of as their best retirement okay so we want that for you\nAnd uh so one of the things that we believe or to make that happen is very important is to protect the nest egg to protect the money the investments that you have built up over all the years that you were saving ... and all that so that you could retire\nAnd you know as I mentioned earlier in the show and\nWe've talked about it cash\nFlow is the primary\nThing that we look at when it comes to your retirement meaning that we want to make sure that to the extent that we can that the income you have coming in is going to be more than the expenses you have going out and we want that to be the case for the rest of your life\nOkay so if we can do that then you've had a successful retirement we've covered your cost of living and we you been able to go out and enjoy your second\nChildhood and uh all is well now cash flow is a function of\nThe amount of money you have to generate that income to generate that cash flow right so the more money you have the more cash flow you can generate the less money you have the less cash flow you can generate does that make sense okay so therefore if a bear market comes\nAnd you lose thirty forty or fifty percent of your money like many people did and why two K. and in two thousand eight then what could happen is that your cash flow could be cut in half right or by whatever amount that your investments dropped and if\nThat was [noise]\nIt would be a big bummer no kidding and if that were to happen to you then what would that do would you be able to cut back like that okay because if you can't cut back if your if your expenses are fixed and your\nAnd your ability to cash\nFlow those expenses is a you know hurt by a bear market then you're going to be spending more than your investments can generate which means that you're doing with farmers called eating your seed corn and if you do enough of that than when groceries and comes guess what you'll have nothing left to plant now\nWe believe there for that you should buy you should hold and you should sell and we have a strategy that we employees that are helped us with that and in November of two thousand seven we told our clients and everybody listening to the show to sell them to get out and to stay out until June of two thousand nine so almost a year and a half and\nThis is because our cell strategy told us to do that so those of you that followed that advice we're out of the stock markets are in two thousand and eight when the market went down fifty seven percent during that period\nAnd our strategy is not perfect okay we we also it does predict bear market that don't happen a notably two thousand Fifteen when the China market collapse and all that it looked like a bear market was coming our strategy said to sell and we did and it turned out it was not a very market okay so I don't want to get anybody of false impression that we have a perfect strategy but\nIt is designed to help us to avoid major catastrophic losses now what the by holders might say is hey you're a long term investor don't worry about it don't ever sell anything just stay in\nWell you know there's there's an expression and I've a it's a skate to me right now who said it but the market has the ability to stay irrational longer than you have the ability to just stay solvent [laughter] okay so it can keep going down you could buy hold your way all the way down and you have out of money or by the time it decides to turn back around\nAnd you know there are there had been bear markets that the market for example the great depression or didn't recover for what twenty five years okay so it takes a while the Japanese market still hasn't recovered but I Want to look back at what happened last week and put it in perspective did you see how quickly the market turned\nDid you see how fast it went down and how much it went down in such a short period\nThe market can do that and that's why I Believe that if you are retired are retiring soon you should have a plan to address that because what if it keeps going what if this is the beginning of the big bad bear\nYou know how much did you lose last week take that multiplied by ten that's what I Would have been a two thousand eight for example could you afford that and what would that do to your ability to stay retired if you are what would it do to your ability to retire if you're not retired yet you're about to\nThink about those kinds of things and ask yourself can afford that if you can't which I think almost everybody listen to show cannot than I think you fall into the Capitol people that agree with our philosophy which is you should have a by yes uh hold yes but also a sell strategy\nAnd so you can learn more about it by going to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd while you're there you can sign up for
