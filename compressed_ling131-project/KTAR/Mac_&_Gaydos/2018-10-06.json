he would have voted yes last week and he never would have asked for an investigation he is so he always tries\nTo to be the nice guy on both sides but he's just full of crap or he's running for president one of the other and that's the other thing\nHe was in New Hampshire earlier this week earlier this year he was in New Hampshire early this year he was putting out his book does he really want to do Arizona a solid does he really care about Arizona well maybe he does a little bit but well he certainly hasn't been on local TV or radio he's been on national he he doesn't want to fight\nHe he wants to run for president he's going to get it but what I mean can you see him let's say he runs as an independent for President Trump is going to just crushed their diet right it is going to be just an obliteration it is going to be Jeff ... she is going to be Jeb Bush all over again what's going to be\nWorse than twenty sixteen ... you know Trump has the has the time in the chair and also has the experience to just just eviscerate him where Jeff Flake can't stand up now how's it going to run for president against Donald Trump I\nI just don't think there are many people in Arizona that want flake as our senator I mean most Republicans\nCan't stand Jeff Flake because the rails against the president\nBut really he votes with the president and if you're a Democrat you know what Jeff Flake does if you're a Democrat because Democrats like like more in Arizona than Republicans in Arizona you know what you know what I speak to the Democrats right now you know Jeff

I'm not against regulation I'm against over regulation I think we should all be against over a ... second think he's done kind of thing in the shackles off in a lot of ways the economy and allowing the the engine roar and\nAs I was talking to my friend about the economy who's super big progressive his wife went to Berkeley great dude I Love and we've been friends since God Knows I Can't even remember since I was born ... eighties eighties it's it's it's great\nBecause I was talking to him and we were chatting about this a he said look you know what\nI\nI don't like the guy only gonna be a human being I think it's a horrible human being\nBut if you're on that side of the aisle or if you're in the middle I can see why you like it looks like he's going to get a second person on the Supreme Court he's trying to do all they can for peace even though he's a you know it was a loud mouth and and and that seems to be a horrible human being outside of a of of his actions when it comes to politics but\nAt the same time the economy is booming and I feel better than I have in a long time about my position and I I couldn't say that under Obama and I said this is the way I think people need to look at this\nPresident Obama had a horrible start\nHad a horrible start that wasn't his fault he came into an awful position I wouldn't wish that on anybody and I\nThis is the analogy I brought brought up is you know there was a coach the coach Michael Jordan and then before Phil Jackson\nAnd they never got to the promised land Kobe and Shaq didn't had Dale Harris before they got to the promised land sometimes it takes that person to get them over the hump to get them there and I\nThe economy look the economy wasn't dead and those without you out there on the writer said that the economy was dead and that that ... from singlehandedly revive that he did not he's made given it confidence in areas that it wasn't confidence but at the same time\nHe's also gone further\nThan Obama did my biggest issue with the bomb is he never let the economy be the economy there was too much tinkering too much regulations too much slowing it down too much self inflicted\nAnd we never got back to the area where I look at Trump and I feel like we're headed in a position that's great and while the ... and this is where where he said you know well the job numbers and all of these things first of all the John number three point seven we haven't seen that since Nineteen sixty nine but also understand how the job numbers work they're always kind of weird hokey numbers\nYou're not looking for a job ... it's still unemployment is extremely low\nDon't get me wrong but three point seven overall but here's one thing\nWell the growth rate economically as far as you staying at your position seeing wage growth that may not be true but because the job market is so open right now people are going they won't give me a raise here but I can go across the street\nAnd get Fifteen twenty percent more that's where it is happening and I don't think people understand that so there's a lot of ways to look at this but the people\nI talked to a you know ... and I was in the financial business for a long time they feel good now they're slow down coming I Want you guys understand the slowdown is coming\nBut I think right now the market's going to be good I think this fourth quarter is going to be amazing I really do I absolutely do three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe\nIs your Twitter speaking of jobs you have one you can't fill it let me tell you what you do zipper critter dot com incredible ... dot com slash band said I'll tell you why you're gonna be able to post your job for free so you post your job ... you need to hire somebody what they do is they use their matching technology to search resumes\nThen they invite those resumes that are the best that match your job\nTo apply for your job then they scanned the ones that do to find the absolute best of the best of the best in fact within twenty four hours eighty percent of people who opposed to a job in separate critter get a qualified candidates for the sake what are you waiting for\nPost your job for free today zip recruiter dot com slash Benson zip recruiter dot com slash ... recruiter dot com slash be an ad so and the zip recruiter the smartest way to hire at you had been some shows your Twitter ...

L. be where do we start with our family he store news today my friend\nWhile I get it real quick when you know I had a console today with my cousin and didn't know it was my cousin till after the conflict but our fourth great grandfather and ... and lived in the same town\nThe first time we've seen each other and two hundred years I chose that which are going to go\nMy first story for family as trainers is in God can again Germany or refer working on a ... century cathedral found on message at a bottle and not on the beach but the ironic twist to this fish is it wasn't no west by his grandfather eighty ears are\nHow [laughter]\nI Love this\nPeter Brand got this note out of the bottle left by his Eighteen year old grandfather back in Nineteen thirty willy Brandt talking about the despair after World War one\nAnd in Germany and wrote quote we hope for better time soon to come well world war two incomes and I don't know if that would have better times\nYeah I don't think so but what an amazing thing I mean he had to look at this and go no this can't be [laughter] but they're both in the roofing business and he knew his grandfather and I guess they overlapped a little bit and and eventually took over the family business it's been going on for for decades\nCreate little time capsule yeah our next story talks about the consequences of war and disease World War one of course many of us have ancestors were part of that and many of our ancestors had influenza\nBut other than that you have to learn from the best in the in the world that's how you could do that on line through Facebook groups such as the hated the fact is our three planes genetic reality and texting Facebook group\nJust by reading puff and there are so many people do script with somebody that you would never sleep if you set them off so you have to kind of just limit yourself to the most current thanks for coming in and\nAnd you'll learn who at the top posters that really are doing groundbreaking tool that will help you to know where it can do it faster\nSo that is how I learned I then I started to conferences to for duty in San Diego we see the and that Institute for genetics and the allergy and so once I was there again you find\nOut people who have been doing it a lot longer than I have how they go about this and and what works and what does it\nWill let's go through that process who you mentioned that you saw just listen listen opportunities basically to help people it is it that there's one person that goes in and works with the individual who posted their their case or my several people being they're working on it\nIt could be several people for for my part I don't usually get up too much with healthy people who are on the board just because I have so many people here locally and people that are actually related to anything by DNA that is going to need help\nAnd so I had a backlog I I thought that was the case was that there are also other ones that are in various stages waiting for that has to come in or target testing people to to solve the puzzle\nSo I don't have time really to offer to let's say in the group I Will answer questions but to specifically help somebody that's not my area that makes sense\nYeah you're you're talking about working with people you know are a bit of us who are referred to locally I get that but the nice thing about this is is is it does mean there's opportunity for anybody to serve somebody else from anywhere you know from a little mountain in Kentucky to somewhere in Russia doesn't make it about half as a hostile to\nCollaborate with that and other states and I never met that ... percent that we trust each other's work and we know how to work together\nDo you find out there there are people with special to use that you lack or vice versa where where you have that collaboration ongoing\nYes um when I was talking to somebody who had Hawaiian heritage and Filipino heritage I found out about it Dr Mann that part of the islands that I had no idea how extreme it was\nAnd so someone said you need to talk to ... had oh karate okay and so then you find out who the special if there is in that area and find out more about it you know the next step same thing with the court TVs eighth or the islands I had an adoptee who fathers like came from that from the violence\nAnd so I'm Catherine was instrumental in helping me figure that out because that threat specialties Portuguese a source of islands and honestly when I went to her class at the first I thought gee in San Diego a couple of years ago\nI thought this has nothing to do with me I don't know exactly land here than it was it that a couple of months later that I met this adopt the who needed that specific health and so I was able to know who to reach out to\nIsn't that interesting and that's really true I I think a lot of people look to many of us who've been doing this for a long long time as the ... of all things in the world [laughter] and the reality is that nobody can know everything\nAbout genealogy whether it's you know when you compare New York city records say to record somewhere in Montana or to some place in in the Netherlands I mean they're very different\nAnd you have to have people who know the territory and the same really applies in genetics as well and ... got to be a real problem for those who aren't familiar with the term it means basically\nYou share many of these same ancestors among your family in other words maybe your father and your mother are second or third cousins going back not jak are a lot of\nCousins and your ancestry married in it are married and yeah so everybody's kind of interconnected more than you would expect\nYeah and that makes a problem because then as you try to figure out what your relationship might be to somebody else you might have a little too much and have to kind of short all that out how do you go about some of those tasks of sorting out in dog too many cases mckell\nFirst started and then out but you look at the ... matches and try to make categories and a lot of it I Can't do in in my head I don't know the the more I said that she does that too ... too and different ...\nAnd different spreadsheets and sometimes with the charts and things like that there are other new tools like the leads color cluster methods so it's partly just being able to have that are ... where the outline must go with this lying even though there is a dog and he you know you see a connection between the two family right in the right generation\nAnd then partly just doing the groundwork a lot of these kids take time if you don't have a super close match like a first cousin or an aunt or uncle or grandparents you know there's not much work to do on a case like that but if if you have like a second or third or ... closest match\nThen it can take some time for the week days weeks months and work on that case sure they're not always quickly called\nRight exactly and it's really very similar process to what they're doing with some of the criminal cases right now mhm undermines your cases involved with adoptees or is it just people trying to break through their lines\nAlmost all adoptees and maybe about half and half with misinterpreted parentage people who grew up thinking their father or the grandfather with one person and that but they do their DNA results they have them access to those lines yeah and find out that their biological I this is in a different line and that could be devastating as you can imagine because\nPeople are very tied into their heritage part of the the search angel is learning how to have that connection to be able to be part social worker and help people feel better if they find someone was a criminal and their land a close relative or something\nYou have to just let them know that doesn't define their heritage\nHey we all got all my downfall gotta mckell right so when you get into this as you as you progress with this what are you finding is the most fulfilling for you\nWhen the case is solved and you're able to walk somebody through their tree a little bit and show them what has been found time and time again they just feel so relieved just to have that closure just to know the course of their life even if they don't want contact her desire contact or the or the other parties don't desire clock out\nIt's not always about contact and about reunions\nAnd so just to see photos of people that you biologically descend from is very fulfilling to most people\nYeah so if somebody wanted to become a search angel how would you recommend they get the proper training not only in the process but in this counseling side of it that often comes with it\nI Would start on those two Facebook pages either DNA detective and or genetic geology tips of techniques and just read up on some of the polls and spend at least some time everyday on them and see what's being discussed\nBecause that doesn't cost anybody at all and you can see it that something you really want to pursue\nGoing to conferences takes time and investment of money that the court and if you can't do it but I think that there are other ways when I started there was no blueprint like here to tell you the answer change off you know right and so what I'm doing now with small groups or change will training and working on writing a book for search angel\nIs to try to fill that gap for people that are starting out and realizing they have a pass after this\nCan have someplace to go and do what the next steps are just to try to say get tied up possibly making some mistakes along the way short with either occasionally at Thirteen so he'll have a hypothesis that it might not be the right one to start with but you have to get to where you're a certain that you have the the tree correct so that you're not spread didn't need that information\nPoor you have a huge responsibility you're absolutely right actually interests\nPossibility you know we do this with volunteers but you also have to have safeguards and be able to follow best practices\nChore absolutely she's mckell ... from Tempe, Arizona which Oh thanks so much for sharing all your information about it I think it's going to be useful to a lot of people\nCome and coming up next year I'm going to talk to a guy I got to

me introduce myself this is\nMoney matters with Ken more right than I Am your host Kendall right [laughter] [noise]\nI have been in the financial services business now for I've been a certified financial planner professional rather for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon so that's you this show is designed for you and uh in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd you know without our beloved clients we would be nowhere so I give that one to them and uh for those of you who are not clients you can go to our website money matters dot\nNet we have podcasts of the show there for you we have videos on Social Security and all all the things that we can think of to help you with your retirement planning we have articles are all kinds of stuff so money matters dot net at our website [noise] so we're going to talk now about\nOne of ... what we believe when when you retire you know you kind of become a defensive coordinator if we want to put it in football terms okay so when you are working and you're accumulating your on off that's\nRight so you're building you're putting money in your you have wages and all those kind of thing so you're living on that and you're putting your money away and so therefore and you have time on your side\nAnd so because of all of that you can be more aggressive in my opinion you can you can take a little bit to you know ... of an aggressive stance but once you are within five years of retirement or five years after that ten year period\nThat is and and we've looked at it we believe it's one of the ... one of the most important periods of your entire financial life\nAnd if you do the math on it and you take a big loss or you do badly during that time\nYou do badly during that time you spend too much money or you do any of those kinds of things during that time what could happen is you could actually run out of money and uh that would not be good\nSo as we work with clients are we we take into account or Eighteen risks faced in your retirement\nAnd uh I Know Eighteen [laughter] that you thought there were only three right\nBut there are Eighteen and we're going to talk about number seven this week which is elder abuse\nAnd this is something that if you have a parent who's in their seventies or or or older or they are the number one according to a\nA these studies that are ... are the targets for this kind of thing and so let me give you some stats on this is actually quite a a disturbing so the annual loss due to elder financial abuse\nTo point six billion dollars or many of the victims are never the same emotionally after being taken advantage of by someone they trust now here's the thing the typical victim is a woman Seventy to eighty nine years old however\nThe victims represent ... there it's a diverse profile including older men and ah it also exists across all ethnic and socio economic groups so it's not limited just to uh women but it is primarily a women\nUm the biggest perpetrators fifty five percent of the perpetrators our families friends\nNeighbors and caregivers\nBut I've had asked what you gotta do better starting back in a hand gun\nWell actually do that is a little extreme is I think there might be a better way we'll talk about a better way of doing it then that a sixty percent of family perpetrators are adult\nChildren adult children\nYou know years ago we actually had that happened we had a client whose son was using his power of attorney to steal money from from that um the crimes often involve misuses of power of attorney stealing money using the credit cards you know they they do that borrowing against the elder person's home et cetera\nThe financial abused perpetrated by businesses can involve large sums of money and and and these these companies are if you want to call him that these these illegal people\nIt's like their business and they they can have hundreds of victims okay so what do you do about it well\nNow first of all I'm going to give you a little quick checklist here so you can protect yourself from ... or by staying organized you know first of all no where everything you've got is and what it's doing so when you get a call that says you know your your investment or whatever is a ... something's happening there you know that it's not true uh\nOpen and send your own male okay don't have somebody else reads your e mails for you open your mail for you or anything like that because they'll get communications that will have your account numbers and all those kinds of things on it and then they can take advantage of that\nSame thing with signing of checks and and credit cards and all that kind of thing to do it yourself don't have somebody else to do that for you\nSet up a direct deposits for all checks that you get you know for example Social Security other things to make sure that any regular checks that you get or direct deposit it to your back because if they are sent to your house somebody gets it and guess what okay\nUse use your voice mail if you get a call from somebody from a a a a number that you don't recognize don't answer that let it go into voicemail listen to the voicemail and then decide if you want to go after that\nAnd then finally make sure that uh you're wills\nYour advanced directives powers of attorney are executed to ensure that only trusted individuals can step in to make decisions for you okay\nAnd and if you are a child of an older person then those same things would apply for you okay so just something for you to think about now as I mentioned we are a retirement planning specialist we work with people primarily who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon so that you\nThen or if you go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net\nUm you can sign up for one of our seminars we have seminars that talk about a year for one K. and diversification are we talking about where to get income from when you are retired we talk about how to make the decision on when to take your Social Security benefits we talk about\nHow to determine how much risk is appropriate for you you know you want you want to\nYou want to take only as much risk as necessary to accomplish our financial goals that's one of our our basic philosophy is we don't want to take any more risk than is necessary so you've got to figure out what that risk level is and we'll we'll help you with that we'll also talk about your magic number\nOkay so the magic number is how much money do we will help you to calculate what we think is the amount of money you should have to be able to retire on\nAnd so that'll help you to know if you have it number one if you do congratulations if you don't then we've

back to their spouses when the stock market goes down then I bet there were a lot of family reunions on in two thousand and eight and nine which you say\nAny way we are back I Am ... the host of money matters with Ken ... I've been in the ... I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these our ideas that are designed around retirement planning because we are a retirement planning specialists and that we currently work with over a thousand four hundred beautiful wonderful families\nAre in forty three states and we are blessed an honored and uh\nFor the second year in a row of money matters are from is a finalist in the two thousand uh Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch awards for ethics yes calmer\nA and we'll we'll know if we're going to be a winner last year we were a finalist and this year we are on November first the awards ceremony will tell us if we will win the the grand prize but\nJust to be nominated just to be one of the uh um you know the people that are in in the running for ethics by the better Business Bureau we perceived to be a very nice thanks so we're very proud of that now one of the foundational philosophy that we have because we are a retirement planning specialist and and and primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty\nUm is that we believe that when you\nAre retired or five years before retired you should be very defensively minded okay now you want to grow your money okay we want you to go out and enjoy your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to do that okay so do play whatever that means you have great fun enjoy travel family\nGolf tennis maybe I Love tennis\nYou know go do whatever it is that you love doing but just always remember that when it comes to your finances if that's going to support your lifestyle\nYou have to make sure that it's there to do it [laughter]\nOkay does that sound logical to you so therefore we believe that you should protect your principal\nYou've spent twenty Thirty years building it and now you don't want a market crisis or a a bear market like Y. two K. or two thousand eight to come in and Rob you of half your money or something like that guy so we believe that you need to protect what you've built\nAnd buy whole which is kind of the mainstream if if you if you ... if you look at it that way idea of investing is that you buy a quality package of investments\nAnd then you rebalance them you know periodically and your job is done because you're a long term investor and everything's gonna work out\nWell we don't agree with that I mean we agree with that you should buy equality set of investments you should\nThe diversify you should make sure that you're taking only as much risk because it's necessary so we believe all of that and you should rebalance we believe that as well but we believe that is all incomplete\nBecause no matter how you know if you look at two thousand and eight for example a diversification only work if you had treasuries pretty much you know everything else lost money so\nYou know and not every single thing but if you look at it in general or the stock market went down and many bonds went down and says like where where could you hide in two thousand eight\nSo we believe you need to have an overly you need to have a strategy to sell to actually get out and you know traders on a on Wall street and I I say T. R. A. D. E. R. not trade tours but traders um ... most traders have\nWhat they call a stop loss strategy okay they invest but they already know when they're going to sell when they invest that's just smart you know you gotta know as can a a a a Rogers used to say you got to know when to hold them and when to fold them\nYou don't just keep playing because uh uh losing hand is not a good idea so therefore we believe you buy hold and you also selling in November of two thousand seven\nWe told ... those who are listening to show we and uh and and anybody that gets our weekly market alert email um our clients we said it was time to get out of the stock market or strategy hit signal does that and we actually said to stay out for a almost Eighteen months almost a year and a half\nUm until June of two thousand nine so those of you that followed the that that uh advice you were out of the market or the stock market to a a and hopefully that helped to avoid large losses now the by hold\nArgument against that that I've heard is that if you sell you know what we're going to put it you're going to put it in cash and the answer that I say is yes and I mean money markets and that kind of thing uh but if you do that you're not going to make any money\nAnd so you know that that one really gets makes me actually frustrated because in a in a period of crisis\nYour focus is on protecting its not building I mean think about there's a there's a hurricane coming okay it's a massive hurricane that's coming\nAnd you're saying okay batten down the hatches well no don't do that because now you can't keep building what does that mean you don't like what are you going to be building for when does a hurricane coming that's not the time to be thinking about building it's time to think about batten down the hatches\nAnd protect yourself protect what's there don't let it get crushed in the hurricane so in your investment world thinking about growing in a time when there's a market crisis to me it's like you've got your eye on the wrong ball what are you thinking about you got to protect what you have\nSo this notion that you're going cash you don't make any money first of all you know I disagree with that just philosophically but secondly you know Benjamin Franklin once said that a penny saved is a penny earned\nAnd if you sell and the and your investments that you didn't ... that had you stayed in go down\nTo me whatever they go down by that's your earnings\nOkay so in two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred index went down what forty percent plus so if you were out of the stock market if you're out of the S. and P. when that happened in my view what that means is the penny saved that forty percent plus that you didn't lose that's the forty percent that you made and to me that's pretty darn good now\nThe other part of this that I just wanted to say is that a yes it's true that right now interest rates are low but this is anomalous you know these interest rates we've seen the last ten years that that's not normal I mean if you go back in history there's very few times and we've had zero percent interest rates\nSo while it's true now I don't know that it's it
