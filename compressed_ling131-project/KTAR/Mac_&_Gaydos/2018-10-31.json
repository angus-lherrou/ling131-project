Australia Ireland in many ways you got to be a resident and in a lot of those cases you parent whoever that parent is has to be born there or citizen to that country so even if you're there for X. amount of time it doesn't matter so there's a lot of things\nBill or ... or ... or probably that his name ... America are talking about you know 'cause it was fun this morning that nobody wants Trump\nHere\nNobody wants him around that's not really the story there was another story to that and even they explain it but it was never really pulled that way\nWe did try to get the message all to the White House that our priority tomorrow is the first funeral I Do believe that it would be best to put the attention on the families this week and if he were to visit to choose from time to be able to do it our focus is the city\nWill be on the families and the ... reached the film you this week and the support that will need to get through it ah once we get past the\nThem so I think for the opportunity for presidents were just\nStand what he's saying look this is a time that the city needs to mourn and he'll and in particular this area who are going to be ... the victims of Saturday's shooting and it should be about them if you're the president and you don't go\nAt this time and we got on with Obama when he stuck his nose in places where he should know and certain times and when he didn't win he should of it's a no win situation\nRight if you go you're damned if you do if you don't you're damned if you do damned if you do damned if you don't he it's a no win situation at this moment in time with this get really really is and it is it is frustrating I'm sure\nIt and if people say well would you have done it for the president said well you know what I think at some point in time\nHe said he's got to do it at this point in this time because of the midterms his travel schedule to get it in right now this is the day he could do it\nAnd so he did it wasn't like he was there all day but I understand that maybe you come in really early in the morning you dip in you\nSay we're coming at five when you really you show up at seven in the morning you meet with the rabbi you do a quick tour and then you get out that to me would have been something else I could you know is up at two in the morning right we all know ease up at two in the morning ... wherever you'd never do in the morning and what's he doing tweeting so you know he's up\nRight\nThat to me is is something he could have done but he's damned if he does and damned if you dust and its\nUgly and right now we're in a bad situation with the rhetoric in this country and it's something to take in because they talked about this this is a a ... they're talking about social media and the Sears John ... works for he used\nThis is the rhetoric in this country and something to take in because they talked about this this is a

hates coming from and how it's being spread\nWhite supremacy in this country is a new you know their belief system as I Know but there's a couple of trends that are converging that are making this a particularly violent time in our history\nIt is it is and when it comes to as he goes on and talks about you know the threat where the threats are coming from you think about things for a second just for a second\nGroups around the world\nLook for the same people\nTo do their bidding when you look at people that ISIS you find people that are usually smarter than everybody else who run this thing

like hey check this out\nWe got power and money man when they rolled in and got old Osama bin Laden he had a lot of my agora a lot of cash you got a lot of\nPorn it's all it's it's about being a godfather and they look for people that are disenfranchised they look for people who essentially are outcast and then they get them into an echo chamber and tell him how horrible the rest of the world is\nHow they've been wronged by all of these other groups\n\nAnd how they should do something about and that is sad and now you've got a platform like nothing you've ever seen before it's not going down\nThe street you could be on the other side of the globe and I could whisper in your ear\nTo these individuals may go out and commit a mass casualty attack a hate crime or vandalized a a house of
