estate goes we're here to help you achieve what ever it is that you need to that you want to achieve in real estate\nThe best way to start the process is by grabbing a free copy of our book your personal guide to buying a home\nGo and get started this is the best way to start to show get it out get it over with because by the end of the show you're going to want a bunch of copies off or your neighbors your friends and so forth but ... book two for one one Ninety two three that's book two for one\nJoe you're going to want a bunch of copies off or your neighbors your friends and so forth but ducks or book two for one one Ninety two three that's book two for one one Ninety two three we've been talking about it and talking about and talking about it fun\nBut now finally the the data is out and uh it it is there and the dangers\nI still would argue the fact that if you could buy buy and then turn it into a rental and make some money down the road on it but neither here nor there there's some people I mean let's just call it what it is just a\nCan't seem to get a grasp on their finances and are continuing to to make poor decisions when it comes down to the credits\nAnd they flat out are in a position or to buy a home and not even in the next four months because of self control some people\nLose their jobs and and have employment challenges and and and and renting is truly the best option early on the only actually there's a there's a lot of reasons but\nThe larger portion I Believe a and I have no data for this but we know all numbers and also to six are made up on the spot or eighty six percent of them are made up on the spot\nSo [laughter] I Would like to think and I I'm pretty confident that the large majorities a large portion of or Katie our listeners who are renting\nOr renting when they could be buying a that they're in a position they may not know that are in a position so if you don't know whether you're in a position or not text book to for one one Ninety two three because if you don't know whether you can buy or not\nThat is ignorance and that is on you or we make it very very simple text book protects toward fun the Fort one one Ninety two three and talked to her friends at home bridge\nBut there are many reasons for it and we are talking about before the break\nBut one of them I think is a we're talking about the unknown they don't understand the process of confused about the process that's why our book is the best tool out there it'll open up your eyes help you understand the home buying process again get a free copy of our book by taxing the word booked two for one one Ninety two three but the other thing is I'm\nI'm just waiting because of the market's gonna come crashing and I'm going to wait\nFor the real estate bubble burst and I'm going to wait for prices to drop all the way down again like they did in ... oh not that I'm going to sweep on in there and by and you know what you're going to be the same people do it no not going well this ... going to continue to fall and you never get into the game\nBut if you're waiting for the market to crash a I fear you're going to be looking in the rearview mirror to twelve to twenty four months from now I'm going okay well my ... gone up even more and if I had a button twelve twenty four months ago I'd have been ... a lot of appreciation about a great investment at the time\nExactly how much money are you wasting waiting because that's really what you're doing when you're renting and it really is that there are reasons that people do need to rent I mean my husband and I had to rent for a short interim before buying our last how there are reasons to rent\nBut there's not really good long term reasons to rent and not be working on a plan towards purchasing I mean that is the American dream only owning a home I and I are friends here at home for it to make it so easy as far as getting pre qualified and asking the right questions and giving you an accurate information\nThat I you know renting can be very stressful you just you you have to answer to somebody all the time the inspections and not being able to make the house personal personally yours\nThe painting or you know what happens if you damage something where you had a pet I mean there's some people have to pay extra rent because there's a pet or extra deposits or then if that pet destroys the carpeting them why you don't get your security deposit back\nI mean those these are things you don't have to worry about when you're home on her and when I was renting I found that I didn't like the flooring and it was worried my kids were going to ruin it but I wasn't about to spend my own money that new flooring into a rental house that I wasn't going to be up for very long so these are all\nIssues and then there's so many positive things to be enabled there's benefits to being home owner\nIf you like a copy of our free book your personal guide to buying a home a text book two for one one Ninety two three that's book two for one one\nNinety two three in gauge today makes a decision today to engage in the conversation and more about the process the other thing we're I think there is no excuse for a and this may come off is very very harsh\nUm but I I Do care about our listeners ah I Do care about our listeners and their financial futures are I Know what the power of buying real estate and what equity has done for me and my family and I wish it upon all of our listeners\nBut if you're have been interested in even thought about buying a home and you have not

can even pre qualify you you haven't talked to anyone really there is there is no excuse for that and and if you're a parent and you're in that situation you have even gone down the road um you've got kids\nThat you that you're responsible where you've got to look after and and I don't want to be the bad guy here but at the very least you you should ... booked for one one Ninety three ending gauge it at least an open conversation about the process\nI agree and like I said marsh no it wasn't her she was is very real of you it's raw honesty I liked it\nAmy's over there got tears coming [laughter]\nI think his joking but you know the thing is\nIs it we do make it so easy and you're right and we were talking before on another show about this being such a good time for buyers to to get into the market because\nThere is you know with the holidays sellers are really serious I'm looking to you know you can get a good deal but I think if you continue to rent you're missing out on the benefits of writing off the interest on your taxes and all the other things that come with it and you're paying somebody else's mortgage when your pain\nAnd I think the other reason than people hesitate a you know you you've got a call from a sales person who got hoodwinked you thought it was something else like crap now they got my number they don't stop calling stuff costs of people are

if they would have planned ahead to get the perfect home\nThat no that's true and that's why it's important that they call you early on because we do have people who get in a situation going OK it

of the day we damn stress shore cranium\nSince Tuesday strong to make a million jackpot has gone up more than three hundred million dollars you buy players who've been flocking to convenience stores and gas stations to step up tickets yeah that's pretty big I couldn't resist buying a ticket\nIf that I'm anticipation that really makes the fun of it everyone thinks there'll be a winner but regardless of how high the jackpot grows\nYour odds of hitting all six falls is one in three hundred and two million there hasn't been a winter since July\nSomebody is going to win it may be a billion dollars\nThat night for you oh God yes yes yes yes yes yes yes it's a chance and what else can a couple bucks\nChange your life somebody's life is going to change it may be this weekend it maybe a week from now baby ... but somebody's life is going to change to the point of ... and right before Christmas too how 'bout them apples\nDoesn't matter what store you buy your ticket from or where are you by your tickets [noise] your chances are always the same\nYeah and it doesn't matter if you buy a hundred tickets or one ticket it is\n\nOnly one ticket that's going to win it's not like you by twelve tickets all twelve are going to be winners you only need one\nYour chances of winning always stay the same whether you can win more money is a direct quote unquote so gambling wise that becomes a better bet\nThere you go and that's what I'm all about better bet baby better bet this is it I made it to win it\nEmily wise that becomes a better bet\nThere you go and that's what I'm all about better bet baby better bet this is it I made it to win it for sure for sure now some of those numbers they need to be dropped like there are\nSome people that on the most frequently drawing numbers because those numbers are hot\nSubject on numbers that haven't come up for a while because those numbers are due\nBut in a game of pure chance it doesn't make any difference\nNow now Phil do you do quick fix or do you do do you have your own little special numbers oh no I just let the computer picket yeah let the computer so here's my thing you go to your favorite convenience store you win five hundred million dollars whatever whatever's going to be after taxes walk with three or four hundred million you go back to that convenience store 'cause they get a\nCut of something but you give them an extra little Chang Chang do you I don't know I've never won well this I I'll tell you on the weekend whether or not I I'm going to give them a little something some extra\nFew always play the most frequently drawing numbers that does not change your chance of winning but if you're doing when they'll be more chances are you'll have to split apart with somebody\nNow there you go it's okay though look I don't care I'm not picky if it's a million bucks if it's five hundred million I knock them bitch either way right like if if if if I went in and twelve plumbers when it from some you know from Long Island I'm not going to go oh my God I Want all the money to myself I'll be like this is not just\nThis is nice and I promise you fill a promise you we will get your song to the top of the charts [laughter]\nWe will through two three five three twenty four twenty three at ... and show is your Twitter so\nYou are you work hard you make your money let me ask you a question would you want to put that money to an organization that fought tooth and nail for government run health care system no how 'bout\nThis organization the portions part of the White House speeches behind closed doors to ensure the passage of the things like the Affordable CARE Act\nNo then why do you get away from our get with aim at the conservative alternative\nIs what a Mac is they offered alternatives to just about every benefit AARP offers but without the liberal agenda now here's the great thing about a Mac [noise] uh they're doing something with my listeners are giving you a year membership for free costs you a penny or you have to do is go to a Mac dot US sports last year on top of all of those things that they do\nThe benefits they offer you are tremendous\nBenefit after benefit retail restaurant movie discounts a theme park discounts you name but they've got the benefits are incredible and it's a year membership they didn't want your credit card all you have to do is joined\nAnd what that means going forward is when you look at what drives an economy one of the biggest drivers is people are buying homes what do they do when they buy\nHomes they buy stuff for their own and that is something that I think you're going to see slowed down a lot in the coming years and it\nAnd you're not gonna be able to blame it on its this policy or that policy is the policy is is we back these kids and given them all this money you go to school and settled them with a lot of debt that they thought they needed and you're finding out that really that isn't is true is a lot of people think and now what\nThey can't get rid of that debt it's going to be with them for a long time and it's going to hinder blood them moving forward into being able to be homeowners and to spend the kind of money that will boost the economy three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... share is your Twitter\nYou can tweet at us love hearing from you so this I find to be interesting in this day and age as we head towards the mid term so we're meant terms of what Nineteen days away\nWe're worried about Russia were worried about China worried about North Korea Bangladesh all of these things\nJust information all of this stuff I still worry about the disinformation I I see here on a daily basis when it comes to all of these ads and things them inundated with uh when it comes to you know mid terms uh props all of these things so uh what are we to do\nIt we're trying to make people either angry or afraid and they were targeting lots of different communities but but the goal was always the same the more you make people angry or afraid the more you can control yeah\nYeah and that right there is a and a demo a who is a disinformation researcher talking about Twitter and all of these things that they've released data ten million tweets from foreign operators going all the way back two years\nAnd what is it to do well fear we talked about greed feared the it's always about voting and emotion\nWell fear we talked about greed feared the it's always about voting and emotion it's about a voting and emotion and and I get this now I get people who send me stuff some people send me stuff and they wanna like I'm going to prove a point other people send me stuff and they say stuff like\nIs this true and then I'll have to go look at the website right look at\nThe website and a lot of times their Web sites that are here in America there are American run websites who have their\nThey have their ideology that they have and they're going to spend something or they're gonna leave out half of the story and that is it that that is frustrating but you have to look at the ... the website how reputable is it who are these isn't it amazing that it only lines up with the way that you believe because for a lot of us\nIt's about affirmation it's not about information so it was easy to do you pick a few things and I see it all the time when we posted in St and do stuff what what agitated angry people what doesn't it's not hard to tell\nOne of the really striking example just off of the San Bernardino shooting in California in December twenty Fifteen most of the trolls posting about the need for the second amendment and and to protect gun rights but some of the trolls posting civil dynasty and using the same hashtags to push for gun control\nBecause they don't care for the whole thing is to disrupt people like this they just wanted to disrupt\nPeople here who want to sell something if you will a about a politician about a prop they're going to tell you half a story or bend the truth or in some cases out now lie\nBecause they want you to vote for something here it was about his disruption they didn't care if they could just upset the apple cart\nThat's the whole thing and the frustration is there's so many people buy into it and this is where I get frustrated because I look at this and I think\nVery nanny state is they want to turn this into now like Facebook and Twitter and all of these companies are getting together with the government and they're there and they will we need to protect these people look if you're an idiot in a mean\nHappens to invoke such an emotion out of you\nAnd I see it out there every single day I see it out there and say if you were so upset about a mean or something and your so influenced by that that's how you write your gullible you're ... if he loses you that much your gullible it's it's it's that's that's just the truth\nWill the accounts tried to do is Moscow grade as real American activists and then engage with three American activists communities\nAnd they did they didn't know how much influence they have that's a different thing but remember ever ...\nIf you study psychology study any of these things it's about voting and emotion 'cause emotions will get you to I always hearken back to what an emotion can do for somebody when I go back to the fact that ah that\nThe [laughter] that astronaut\nWoman who was so enraged and in love and emotion for that or the other astronaut that left her\nShe drove across country wearing adult diapers had like duct tape and her car her motion was so for that to me it's just oh how do you do lots of motion when you can get people to to to not have a conversation to\nBe blinded by something so much so and when I Do my when we do videos we do all these kind of stuff I'll see some people chime in and there are a motion is so strong on some certain things it's it's crazy\nIt really is you take a step back take a breath but they're blinded by then what happens they get Indian dated every single day\nBy step because they're looking and they're searching and and they're searching for something the left does it with their micro aggressions and things like that\nThe right does the same thing too and everybody searching percent what can I find what can I find I Want some affirmation I Want some affirmation oh this person asked me what country I'm from so their for their they've offended me or this over here this mean came through and this has to be true about Elizabeth Warren or something like that and\nIt's a motion is emotion emotion emotion and you're being manipulated and you don't always know your right because sometimes the stuff looks so real but in saying that that's why you need to be\nWell versed in a lot of these things meaning you have to do some research if you're serious about am I being manipulated you'll do some research if you only want affirmation then at that point in time it doesn't really matter and the ... only firing you have to do something it's not actually changing your mind 'cause your minds already made up\nYou can actually see through the lifetime of these accounts they were posting more radical content and they were trying to get people more and more riled up 'cause that's when they got the most impact that that's the way social media tons of ... the more emotion you put into it the mole feedback you get\nThat again emotion greed all of those things the best selling book you'll find in the world has nothing to do with sales\nYou can't yeah again emotion greed all of those things the best selling book you'll find in the world has nothing to do with sales has old to do with the psychology\nYou want to learn how to sell go down and get a psychology book because when you can find a psychology book that that has the right kind of tone that you know that you can start to manipulate\n'cause that's what it is some people buy stuff but a lot of people are sold stuff how do you do it with the motion you can look great in his car unit tons of women you can make so much money if you do this or by this it's it's nuts it's crazy it's about emotion three two

planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and boy how has this year been and exciting one\nWith all the stuff that's been going on and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talked about with our beloved and most valued client\nWith all the stuff that's been going on and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states\nAnd uh we cherish them we value them we just enjoy the responsibility that we have to to help them with their finances to be their guide\nAnd a recently uh the barons named him walk her faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states [noise]\nYes and actually for the sixth year in a row and that again is all because of our clients so thank you guys I Hope those if you listen to the show or having a fantastic weekend I Hope everything is just coming up roses for you\nAnd I this week a I'm a I'm Talking about something that I think is a very important it's it's very important to us but I'm gonna I'm applying it to you from the standpoint of how you can apply in your life and I think if you apply these principles that what'll happen\nIs that um you know I think that you're financially you'll be successful but I also think it will be successful in life and uh so the same kind\nOf things that it takes to have a successful business success successful financial advisory firm I think are the same sort of things that can help you and your own life so I'm gonna tell you about our core values but at the same time I'm I'm going to apply them to you and hopefully you can get some some benefit from that as well\nSo this segment I'm In Thailand you are the most important person in the entire world so as I mentioned in the previous segment we are we not work with a uh a thousand families and and you know when you think about how many people that is you got grandparents children grandchildren and in some cases great grandchildren\nIt really becomes like a whole community of people that were responsible for\nAnd for us not to think about how do we make what we do indoor\nHow can we keep money matters in during\nA ... would be irresponsible of of us you know with regard to our clients and and their families so we we have we called vision one hundred which means that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong are stronger than it is today and to do that we have to establish you know who we are what we stand for how we behave\nAnd then whatever changes technology economy markets brings it doesn't matter it's how you behave it's what you do it's your values so in your family it it would be the equivalent of again of teaching your kids and your grandchildren et cetera\nThis is what our morals are this is what we value this is what's important in life\nAnd if you apply these they will transcend time they will transcend technology et cetera\nThis segment is you are the most important person in the world so we have to core values that applies that number to a number of force of core value number two says that our clients benefit before we do\nNow I Believe that in life if you are selfless\nIf everything you do is geared around helping others\nThat what happens if it comes back to you tenfold I don't know how it works it's this magic that happens it sometimes it's called karma sometimes it's called the golden rule\nIt it's there's it's what reaping and sewing I mean the religions talk about it all the time and if you focus entirely on benefiting those around you\nIt it will come back to you and I think a lot of the success that we've had is because that's our philosophy that's how we live\nSo that core value our clients benefit benefit before we do um we have a weekly meetings that we have with our senior financial ah partners or our senior partners where we talk about strategy we talk about uh you know what we're going to do it given market conditions and all those kinds of things\nAnd in that meeting we had a chair it's an empty chair but it belongs to our clients\nAnd what we say is we want to always imagined that a client is sitting in that room with us while we're having this meeting\nAnd we always used that as our litmus test that clients sitting in that room with us with day approve of what we're saying in this meeting or would they think that we're a bunch of cats [laughter] okay are we like a ... we want them to be proud of us at all times\nSo this kind of goes to behave as if somebody's watching you all the time behave as if what you're doing is is is impacting others because when you start looking inwardly then you start becoming self that you start becoming ... close up and you close up\nOpening to all the opportunities that are out there for your core value number four says if a client calls us we lost\nAnd what I mean by that is is that\nIf people rely on you you know you have to think of yourself as their servant you know we feel like we work for everybody\nYou know I'm the c._e._o. of are from but I feel like I'm the employee of every person that works at our firm I'm here to facilitate them I'm here to make sure that they can do their job the best they can I work for everyone you know I'm not I'm no one's boss\nAnd it's the same thing with our clients we want\nThey are to make sure that they can do their job the best that they can I work for everyone you know I'm not I'm no one's boss and it's the same thing with our clients we want to be proactive so when we say if the client calls us we lost but I mean by that is that if a client calls us about something that we should have told them about already\nThen we lost so if there was a mistake made or if there's something going on in the markets or anything that a client would call us about\nWe should be a head of that we should be pro active leak communicating with our clients in advance so they don't have to call us so therefore if a client cause us we lost now of course there are things that are clients going to call us about that we have no way of knowing right they moved or you know there's a change in their life or something happened\nThose situations obviously if a client causes we didn't lose but anything that we should have told them first we did lose so in your life I think about people and uh how you run your business or if you're a if you work you know your boss your the people that a report up to you your peers\nKeep them informed about what's going on don't ever let somebody call you and say hey what's going on with that\nWhen you told them you were on top of it keep them informed at all times and you'll give them peace of mind do trust you and you'll be ... and I think you'll be happier in the process as well though there is no doubt okay\nNow we are a financial

money matters that can rape and of course I Am your host Ken ...\n[noise] thank you Jack\nI've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are\nNineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are\nThe same ideas we talk about with our love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nWithout our ... and most of your clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is\nThat I Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on\nFamilies that are you're doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisory firm die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be a strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values so strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are bad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do\nTherefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for the for them so that is a culture that is the values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or the or or the or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that you stand for\nAnd and these are the things that endure over time regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that endure over the course of time\nNow one of the things that uh we believe in in terms of managing our clients money is we want we want our clients we want you to grow your money but we want you to keep what you what you built we want you to grow your money with confidence\nAnd so because of that we have a strategy that we call by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also sell\nAnd the reason why we do that is because you know you can make tons of money you can invest in you know think of bitcoin for example okay some people invested in bitcoin inside go up to whatever\nAnd then now it's come way way down\nIf you if you bought near the top and it grew and you're thinking look at that I made twenty five percent and then the whole thing last then you could be down you know you've lost money on the deal so you don't have anything until you actually salad that's when you realize the value that you created in this investment so\nTherefore what's on paper makes you feel good you think you've got it but really it's it's when you sell it that it actually becomes something that is of value so therefore to protect our clients we have a by holding cell philosophy now\nAren't we have ten core values and I want to share with you core value number three okay which is take only as much risk as necessary to accomplish your financial goals now the reason why we say\nThat is because risk is not your friend okay and and taking high risk in the search for high returns is not really your friend okay people who take high risk you know they get lucky and or they'll hit one\nAnd then they'll try it again and then they want and they have the cycle of bankruptcy and growth in Pakistan ... so what we tell us what we tell people in fact we say this at our seminars is that if if the goal is to make the highest return possible then here's what I recommend\nSell all of your investments okay go out just go on the Internet right now sell everything you've got turn it all into cash but in a suitcase and we'll meet up next Tuesday and what we'll do is we'll all get on a bus and we'll go to Las Vegas together okay everybody with our little suitcases full of money\nAnd then when we get to Las Vegas we are going to go to the roulette wheel and we're going to bed at all on red okay we're big bat now if we hit or going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people but\nOkay we're big bat now if we hit we're going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people\nBut the problem is it may not be read in which case will be a very poor group of people [laughter] so do you want the highest returns Vegas awaits but somewhere between burying it in the back yard you know in a can and going to Las Vegas in betting it all on red lies how much risk you should take\nAnd our goal philosophically in life and I think your goal in life should be the same thing is take only as much risk as it is necessary to accomplish your goals\nYou [laughter] well I Love you back because if you take more risk than is necessary to accomplish their goals what it what you're doing their you know the market has a way if you're you're being greedy okay and if you think back to that movie years ago Wall Street with Michael Douglas races greed is good well you know what\nThe stock market has a way of spanking greedy people's bottoms bright red you know you get those red cheeks like a ... you don't want that does not a pretty sight okay you don't want bright red cheeks\nSo take only as much risk in your life in your finances in all areas that is that is necessary to accomplish their goals otherwise so we try to push our clients down to the least amount of risk that we can take with their investments and still accomplish their goals\nSo making four percent a year makes you secure financially then you know what that's all we need we're not going to go chasing after ten or Fifteen Percent and the risk that comes with that it's just not worth it\nOn the other hand if you're if we need to make six percent then we'll take a little more risk than we would with somebody who only needs for okay so take only as much risk 'cause it's necessary to accomplish their goals\nOkay so that's our core value number three that I Want to tell you that if you'd like to visit with us if you'd like to talk with one of our financial advisors um or you'd like to go to one of our seminars a I encourage you to do that go to our
