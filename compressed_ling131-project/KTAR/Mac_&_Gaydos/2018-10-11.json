are still undecided pollster Mike normal tells KTLA are this race is still very close\nLook at all the polls one thing we can all agree on is that this race is incredibly close and I think it will be close enough is why the Arizona Senate contest is the hottest race in the country and that's why we have a front row seat to\nThe latest poll was conducted October first and second it has a margin of error a plus or minus four percent\nSays are Omar Carlson they're like Mark a oh look I don't know if the race he is dead it yet but it feels like there is\nA surge when it comes to what's taking place as far as Sally goes that she is starting to pull away and it's it's very interesting because the people I talked to a that I have\nThe sources who you know by got people on both sides of the aisle Democrats and Republicans and and and my my people in D.C who control and see a lot of money flowing here and they've talked about how important this raises are starting to pull back a little bit first of all they know the governor's races\nDead they've abandoned that idea David Garcia is kind of really in so many ways became a it was a one trick pony had didn't have any answers anything and on top of that\nUh like a lot of these doesn't want to sit down and talk many bailed on Mac and get us thinking idiotic moved to do that you have a chance to come on the the biggest talk show\nAround in the biggest station in the state and you have your opportunity to go after governor do she's gone and to hit the hit back\nAnd you bailed that's on you\nHere's been cinema David Garcia we've asked him on numerous occasions we're going to give you the platform I'm not a guy that's going to break you I'm going to give you the platform I'm gonna let you talk I'm like I'm gonna ask you some questions it is going to be a very grownup conversation for radio silence that's fine\nThat's fine but that shows me everything I Need to know it does and people are starting to go I Know she it I'm telling us what Sally ads like them or not or really hammering really hammering her and\nShe's she's losing ground Sally is hemorrhaging support among the fifty five in older crowd and I do too I think I've seen the ads out they're attacking under votes on health care so she's been getting hammer with those that\nYeah she has been she's absolutely been hammered by those ads and she's continuing to pay the price for it and when I don't hear is the fight back you know you'll ... you'll hear her people\nSay well she's gone back and she's she's hit back at that and it's not fair that she does that and I'm good with the fact that you don't have to run an awful campaign that's one thing I'll say is is on her side she hasn't gone over negative I don't want to hear the Louvre negative I Want to hear the positive sell me you\n\nBut it's okay if you hit back if somebody hit you first doesn't mean you have to come back and talk about a horrible they are but\nYou can at least answer some of the questions\nThat are out there and I think the Democrats are looking at this as what they thought was the huge potential I Know there's people out there that still think that she's going to come and she is going to to to come from behind and she's going to win and some people say to play the victim card and all of these kinds of things it to me and now there's a net that\nThat down there now you may have gotten a you may not at the holographic postcard where you've got to ... you know the cinema and there's a picture of\nOf of you know essentially the the you know the the Phoenix landscape and then it just if you twisted a little bit it's a much\nShrimp cloud and they're they're making the point of it goes from point a to point B because of you know Luke air force base and because of Iran and because of all of these things and boom\nIt's crazy it really is and how we get to this point is sometimes I think a who buys that there's a lot of people out there that that that may potentially happen and we may be new because of her\nBut they haven't shown me anything she hasn't show me anything and when you're not willing to sit down and talk to have a friendly conversation I have an issue with that I Do I have an issue and I reach out to everybody normally I don't like that politicians on\nBut in a race this important I absolutely and I'm never going to tell you who to vote for I don't care if you vote all left all the time are All right all the time\nMy thing is I Want to give people the platform I'm gonna ask some questions that are fair I'm going to find out more than just why they're like this why they vote this way and that way and then we're going to allow you to make up your own mind when it comes to stuff like this but if you're not willing to sit down

Arizona's news station PTA aren't in\nArizona afternoon we get our news Ninety three of them back in ...\nOn the program later this hour I think the question everybody wants to know why did ice dropped hundreds of asylum seekers into this thing we're going to get some answers if some answers\nFrom the head of ice has our news director Martha Mauer has spoken with the head of ice and I think everybody's wondering why Arizona why four to seven hundred asylum seeker so we will talk about that coming up Michael the hurricane goodness gracious officially stronger than Katrina Atlanta fall I repeat that because I never thought I'd say that\nHurricane Michael officially stronger than Hurricane Katrina and landfall\nWow Michael was the third strongest hurricane ever make landfall\nIn the United states so why haven't we seen the devastation like Katrina with Michael so far we've only seen two deaths that's been attributed to the hurricane debts and devastation to different things yeah\nUh when we go to the source sorry Pete ... an ABC News correspondent in the Florida Panhandle right now ... what are you seeing and how devastating was this hurricane\nGuys I got to tell you I've covered for two to hurricanes the past\nYou know Twenty years and I will tell you the devastation from hurricane Michael is by far the worst I've ever seen look I'm sitting in a parking lot in a residential area not close or not very far from a ball field the ball field is lit at night all of the light poles are tending to the right though their\nApartments here smaller houses and the roots are off many of them are all of the trees here every single one of these trees either is completely to fully ate it or is broken it's shattered\nSome of them twisted in the end the tremendous wins that it here at Panama City beach in federal city I should say and look guys I could go on and on with this I have seen devastation block after block after block and I've got just one word for it heartbreaking that's all I got four heartbreaking\nWhy do you think in terms of comparing this hurricane to others like it's not being talked about like Katrina it may not be talked about like Andrew it's not being talked about like\nUh the one in Houston I'm Harvey why why is that Michael was so horrific why isn't it in the same breath as all these other hurricanes can you explain that to us because I don't have any answer\nGive it time fellows I'm telling you this is\nAn amazing story and then not at a good way it is devastating it is heartbreaking it is more devastation more destruction that I have ever seen look yesterday was shock and awe today it's heartbreak and it's got to be a story that slow to get out because these areas\nOf the the Florida Panhandle are fairly isolated a right now you can't get here for my ten so the majority of whatever price wasn't here when this happened is still trying to get here\nI promise you it's going to be a big story over the days to come\nOver the days to come it is a heartbreaking story and it's it has emotionally difficult actually to sit here and talk to you about it\n... ... ABC News correspondent in the Florida Panhandle uh it it it's emotional ... like you said it's tragic in it it definitely devastating\nAre are we are we talking about finding people dead in their homes are we are we talking about a month now electricity coming back are we talking at that level or is it just a matter of property just ruined the insurance companies will have to deal with this\nWell\nI mean according to a tweet by Maricopa County recorder Adrian ... says he blow to come that little bit nearly as many Arizona is registered to vote on line Monday and Tuesday as in the whole month of September and I think Taylor Swift came out over the weekend and said\nYou know with her with her you know a response to it wasn't a response was her basically get out and vote for young to me he liked my music you gotta you know get into politics a little bit and here's why you need to go and do it in a lot of people did it\nBut I Will Thursday though to say you know Arizona the election officials are crediting Taylor Swift you try to be cool man come on\nWho you're talking to whoever said that ... or whatever you want him an athlete he put out a tweet why are you calling him an old man oh well he's not twenty four he's not a fan girl of of of Taylor ... a middle aged man [noise]\nI mean come on here's this you're going to credit Taylor Swift for Arizona boy it looks a little Thursday\nTo me thirsty ... a little desperate little desperate Adrian ... says ah Arizona is killing it we had nearly as many people registered to vote on line in the last two days as we had in a whole month of September I blamed Taylor Swift [laughter] why\nAre you blaming anybody I blame you that no one was allowed to ... thousand people couldn't vote the primary\nMan you got to get your crap together dude it's unbelievable\nWhat sue elections here in Arizona right my goodness they make a lot of a mess they'd been a total disaster so now we've got forty one thousand more people who want to vote that's not good they are going to show up at these places saying they're going to show us I don't know what they're going to show I guess we're either\nGoing to show up at these places and the computers aren't going to be turned on or the building is an open or the the the volunteers didn't ... didn't they ... they decided not to show up\nUh I don't find volunteers they can't find enough fallen tears to work the polling place you've only\nHad forever to find volunteers yeah goodness gracious\nYou'd only a lot of Sun City I work at the sun city right get a bullhorn just say hey listen who wants to work well you'd have to go door to door with that bullhorn 'cause they can't\nHere I Would agree with that go to ... go door to door you know a bullhorn yeah so you got to do right\nBut but I mean I guess I Would have weird time we live in hey Taylor Swift made everybody register to vote in Arizona well really\nA K that logic dude that's in large so and and I and I think that she's one of the very few people that could pull this off he just wants her to re tweet his tweet that we're all it is it's about social media ... girl exactly see and what I'm saying but but do you want them to go and vote see that's the you\nKnow if you don't know anything about what's happening in your state don't go and vote for a Democrat correct cause Taylor Swift said or don't go and vote for Republican cause some other person said ... if you don't know\nDon't vote I don't need you to vote on it\nI don't think everybody should vote if you're not if you're not and you know what let me say this if you're if you're young you're listening to show your in your twenties and you're not really into politics there's nothing wrong with that\nThere's nothing wrong with that you don't have to be completely you know have to be hard ball ... but she did you go and vote for governor probably you know they probably senator probably and then you know don't know who you're voting\nFor an end shed Bentsen last night of the show I mean he ... there are three different types of voters any nailed it okay there's a voter that's very involved up on politics knows who they are voting for there's the oh yeah that's right it's every two or four years okay when I Need to know I'll figure it out and then there are people that go because they have no clue and\nSomebody famous or some one of their friends says you should vote for this person and they don't do their homework and they're not they're not invested so those people go and vote and it ruins it for a lot of other people maybe they'll show up at the polling places in Arizona that won't work on election day what is that gonna do\nThey won't vote if they will be allowed I Know they won't be able to\nAlright alright coming up next why
