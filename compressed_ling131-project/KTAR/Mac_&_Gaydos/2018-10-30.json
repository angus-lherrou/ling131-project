and it's an allowance\nAnd all this but I'm not talking about that right now what I'm Talking about is the tunnel Trump push people over the edge to go in mail bombs and to go into a synagogue and kill people I don't think so\nI don't think so if he toned down a little bit I think that would be better for the country because he's not unite or he's a divider right he's never going to change and

'em or not\nBut he also blame the media which is not accurate as well but you can make an argument\nHe's going to be defensive with the media because the media in some cases have just an outright hit

hasn't called any of the victims of the bombs hasn't called the Obamas with the Clinton\nThat's a total his job he doesn't have to call the people who have gotten the bomb not only is that the job right but the president should also come out and say oh the media portrays me in a bad light when you say things like hey beat the crap out of that guy and I'll pay your legal bills and you're the president you shouldn't be saying stuff like that he\nMisbehaves and I think the media misbehaves and I think what it does is it angers people here in the United states but does it angered them enough to go and carry out a mass shooting in Pittsburgh does it angers someone enough to go over the edge and start building bombs and sending\nAll right let me push back just a little doesn't anger them enough no buddy name Bolden people I think\nThat what we saw in Charlottesville what we see now there is more hate and hate speech of people going that President speaks for me and you would have never

depending on what state you're at right here in Arizona immigration is big but someone's healthcare costs of health care is massive and we're going to go to the polls in just over a week\nNot only are we going to elect new people that we think are going to do the job for a state or in in our state we're gonna like new people that we think are going to go there and do a job representing our state and and for the country and those things are out there for ... years didn't cinema tomorrow she's going to be on with a a you know there's ... short\nIt it's gonna be interesting to see how she handles this uh in the next week or so she kind of disappeared yet Martha McSally\nWho is now because of this caravan it's becoming a huge thing and immigration is back in front and center and we're\nWe're a nation that is influenced instantaneously by certain things we the gun control may not be on anybody's mind and after a situation like what we saw as we can Pittsburgh all of a sudden it out their front and center becomes on everybody's mind and when it comes to immigration\nI think that's going to be something that's big but\nThis is interesting listen to this this is kind of a breakdown a montage of what's on people's mind as we had until next Tuesday\nSupreme Court nomination process was something that impacted my decision making\nBig\nNews service or a lot of people that\nThey don't over the things that has to be covered wages increase along with the cost of living never\nSeen that red ... not like you don't win and tax person left here talking to brown and black voters\nSupport the President Trump's message and his agenda that's largely why I came out and say if you could send a message [laughter] [noise] um things need to change\nGoing to be a sign of everything drained that's for all get together we are one that says it's time to put our politics aside I tend to play it all up your pants let's get to work and get the song\n[noise] yeah I mean it all sounds great but you know a lot of people who already voted and so they've already vote on the issues they think are going to be important and some of this stuff is going to be the new influential thing that may lead into next Tuesday that may sway somebody one way or another ah for me I look at I look at health care is a perfect example\nRight so people getting ready for two thousand Nineteen we'll start seeing what these premiums are going to be the rising cost of health care the fact that nobody's done anything I've said it over and over the Republicans loses they only have themselves to blame you can blame Trump in his rhetoric and all kinds of stuff is you want but the fact\nIs a lot of his life at your feet because you haven't done enough right you haven't done enough\nYou've failed to to pass any comprehensive immigration reform you've failed to repeal and replace Obamacare was something better something that I think it would be you know far reaching and better for everybody bows cost prohibitive\nA permitted that it is now it could be it could be cost effective for everybody you failed to do a lot of things so I blame you on that in saying that the Democrats you had a chance before you implemented Obamacare it's cost what didn't save us twenty five hundred dollars and family is anybody other seven twenty five hundred bucks a pack it didn't\nDo a lot of the things that a lot of people thought it was going to do and when you had an opportunity and I've talked to several DACA recipients and people that are here they said the same thing that the Democrats have the opportunity to take care of DACA and they didn't do it when they had the chance it's been failure after failure by both sides\nSo leading into this it's going to be interesting to see how people play this thing out this final week because a good majority of independence most of the bases have already done\nWhat they're going to do they're sending back their ballots there early voting they're doing that they they knew exactly what they were going to do the minute the the the candidates were formed and they were out there and they knew who was running and who was running against do and vice versa they've kind of made up their mind\nOr some way to the last minute because maybe looking at props and trying to understand some of those things but the reality is for a lot of people out there they're still looking around going the independence that will sway the school and I'm not quite sure I'm not quite sure and for a lot of you that I'm hearing for ... you're not

only an affront to me but it was an insult to the medical profession\nEventually they were sending their endorsement of her and they demanded that she take down the science is eventually\nDid so what did she want to ... to ... think you were lying or are they is it because you haven't practiced medicine in what of ten years may is that what it is\nRight and I've always made it clear when I speak to folks at rallies or gatherings whatever is in my bio it's on the website\nIt's it's been made abundantly clear and and as well as to her face I've told her this and numerous occasions and I've

Jim sharks\nAh interview earlier this morning with Pearson cinema or you'll hear the audio and you'll hear a cinema respond\nThe video they put out yesterday this is not great ah it's Lauren from which per project berets us as he field organizer for your campaign here's a little bit of that video she is pro choice she's here with Roche [laughter]\nBut she does is in this election line drive much attention to be\nOK so first off is Loren from part of your team and second is she telling the truth or you are progressive in are you just acting\nModerate to get elected by I don't know who ... so I can answer that question\nI'm about what they say she's a field organizer for your campaign well let's take everything they say with a grain of salt okay convicted criminal when I Can't tell you is that my record of standing up for women and their ability to make their choices about their health care with their families and their doctors is it very clear record\nBut equally clear is my record standing up for Arizona and I've been right the third most independent member of Congress\nAnd as you well know taking some guy from the left because I vote with the president sixty two percent of the time and the reason I Do is because I Believe in idea has merit no matter who brings up for it whether it's a Democrat or Republican\nSo I Believe that Arizona voters deserve a senator\nWho will do what's right for them and who will talk about the issues that matter most to them my record shows that\nRight Jim sharp with your ... and send them a listen I don't know this right wing activist group is the film cinema undercover I Will just tell you a as a guy who's a independent I don't give a crap\nYeah and I'm here and and they may be some people do all this plays well to a base of certain people that make Sally has been talking to repeatedly during her campaign mhm cinema hasn't campaign that way and it's up to you as a ... informed voter\nTo figure out if here since ... is just saying stuff to get elected okay if that's your decision I should but this isn't some gotcha that that that this project Vera toss has conducted some staying that out here since ... look\n... if you don't care since cinema for any amount of time you know that she is a Democrat and she probably does have some progressive ideas you kinda know what you're getting\nBut she votes where the president sixty percent of the time so you know I Do I think this is a game changer know if this is all they have boy they don't have a lot\nI just don't I don't buy that she's protesting troops her family's in the military she got two brothers in the military I don't think you have to family members in the military and you go out and protest them you can protest the war right you can be against the war I I just I think a lot of things have been you know song at her and I think a lot of them are pretty weak\nI think there's a lot of other things you can get here since ... on but being a anti troop I don't think so\nOr new progressive ... well again if you vote with the president sixty percent of the time\nYeah I mean again that that's up to you but I don't think this thing is if this is not gonna make Sally jump ahead in the lead with pinpoint\nTwo polls out today cinema plus six mix Sally plus one those are the two new one's going to be close are coming up next a woman's Halloween costume almost
