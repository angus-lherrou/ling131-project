I might them our news in a new station PTA armies\nArizona's New York or new that you\nKnow continuing coverage of President Trump in Arizona had been\nYeah what a night tough so Trump is uh probably about twenty five minutes away or so from a doing his thing we'll see what happens joining us now somebody was live out their gym cross our very own Jim how you doing Jim\nI'm doing ... first time on the show\nHe gradually ... your newbie welcome and thanks thanks for having me yeah so what's it like out there give us a little description it describes the people what you're saying\nWell the hangar is just about all at oh maybe four or five thousand people but there is ex potentially more people outside I'm we're talking thousands of people lined back as far as you can see in fact I Can't even see the end of it\nIt goes for about a hundred yards a out of the hanger and then down the street all the way at least the sauce but uh this place is going to be absolutely bad though when people have to wait and I\nBecause you're looking at ... I heard some estimates earlier thirty five maybe forty thousand people and if that pans out and right now who knows it's going to get better\nOr it may have you been attacked I mean that's the funny thing I Would watch it all night on all these things and it's it's you know how much she hates journalist and their crowd age journalists and I'm not finding that to be true but how are you feeling there so far so safe\nI mean it that people would talk to them and really cool a with us you know a very passionate about the president and the Republican Party um uh they expressed what they want to hear tonight they want to hear about order\nThey want to hear more possibly about you know a son in the military to or a on her more of other tax cuts and ... and you know the things that he talked about what last month out of the guilt talk about our own good at that\nBut on other has been good and it's just I tell people I mean right now I Would really hate to put an estimate on it but it's it's several thousand tens of thousands\nBut on other costs been good and it's just I tell people I mean right now I Would really hate to put an estimate on it but it's it's several thousand tens of thousands\nTalking to very own gym crosses she's out there at the Trump rally or is this surprising you the size of the crowd did you expect something like this\nNot really but I I'll tell you right now a Mesa and whoever it beyond them put this together did a remarkable job with a lay out I mean it's totally different than you know in a confined relatively confined space like say downtown Phoenix or or the president came last time for a rally because you have\nYou know this this big airport you have a lot of uh a empty lots to work with\nUh the gateway going into the hangar is about Seventy feet wide you have the to free speech solves Bush about Seventy feet apart uh we've had a tremendous amount of um the president's supporters here some got here last night\nUh we have seen very very few uh protesters at all I think the highest counter San jose it's probably it doesn't it seems to be able to we're at right now\nYou know what's interesting about that is you know a lot of what people are thinking this is this you know he's really pushing for the midterms he wants to hold onto the house the I think we all kind of think he's going to hold on to the Senate but the house would be surprising ah what's your sense there are there are people there that are there for any parts of the mix Sally or is this really just about Trump\n[noise] um I uh that's a great question honestly I think there are more for the president uh I think that if they certainly are people in the crowd\nThat are mixed rally supporters uh the governor was here spoke a few minutes ago Andy Biggs the congressman\nOr speaking a few minutes ago I but I Would say an overwhelming majority or just want us to the president of some of the people I've talked to today have have gotten to the president's rallies before uh some have never been there they're big followers but they've never been to a rally and they wanted their experience of themselves\nMan we're uh we're not too far away from yes that guy President Trump is going to be speaking he's here in Arizona are joining us now is one of our political expertise led to bring him on from high ground ... senior vice president research a strategy over there and a poll what are you looking for tonight when it comes to the president\nI keep thinking he's going to do something about the the the wall and and maybe make some announcement but ah what do you think's going to happen tonight\nI think this is a rallying the troops exercise it's no mistake or why he is visiting the places that he's visiting staying in Scottsdale a rallying in Mesa going out to the west valley to visit Luke this is about encouraging\nRepublicans and the key bases of Maricopa County and getting them excited and make sure that they're turning out\nYeah because they're just you got to get some excitement and you know when you look here's the thing there's polls and then there's other ways to look at stuff and it's tough to get a handle on stuff because I think a lot of people as you know sometimes people say things that they think the person on the phone wants to hear I don't have a real\nFeel of where this they sometimes I think ... gonna when there's no walk away and other times I think that that makes a cinema is ... is going to sneak by\nAnd I know Trump's out here and he's got to push for this thing and it's going to be much closer than I think people think what's your sense of what's going on out there is going to help her or or hurt her\nI think we'll see in the rally shortly here but as long as he sticks to the script and I think it can be have a little bit I think it will definitely help right now we're seeing\nA slight Republican surge more than we expected the blue wave as not hit the beaches here in Arizona so I Do think that's helpful two weeks ago I Would have told you that I thought cinema really had this thing but\nThere's been a lot of pressure on her she's been having a couple of bad weeks in a row said she was embarrassed for the uh you know the state in that video that was released and then she says she's not a proud Democrat it's been really hard to nail down\nWhat she stands for ... the doors open\nFrom ... and I think this rally tonight will really determine if she's able to walk through it or if we get further away\nAbsolutely talking to ... vice president researcher strategy over at high ground ... and a\nTrump's going to come out there tonight he's got a lot of support here this is still a red state ... I'll be at the demographics in many ways I think are changing this and and I think uh sooner rather than later we're going to have a little bit more purple of a shade but immigration is still a front and center here in the state and we've got a caravan coming up\nThere's a lot of things happening here that that people are looking at\nHow much is that going to help make Sally and especially as we move towards the midterms and that was just going to be able to to use that to to to push everybody\nUh how mix Sally and ... especially as we move towards the midterms and now it's just Trump going to be able to to use that to to to push everybody forward as far as the Republicans go\nWell our polling shows continually that immigration is the second highest issue in the state it's the highest number among Republicans so if that's where he goes today make salaries experience representing southern Arizona and representing a border\nCongressional district I think will be helpful I think that might be a mixture of some immigration issues as well as some national security uh you know public safety type issues playing ... background\nA Trump Sears doing this thing\nA ... going to be out there tonight all this stuff is going on and we talk briefly about cinema I look at the cinema and it's an interesting thing is I'm a Mac and gay does uh she she's interesting because you don't know where she stands which is weird I Know people can change or how much of a ... of of a super\nLefty is she or if it were those are younger days when all of us were maybe a little bit more liberal rallies what's the old St Paul that if you're not a if you're not a progressive when you're in your twenties you have no work no heart yeah you're not a\nConservative in your thirties you don't have a brain has she changed and and why isn't she coming out and being a little bit more forceful not so much the attack ads and things like that I kind of admire the fact that she's not\nGone deep and dirty but in the way that she comes out to defend herself and maybe to find herself better\nI'm not sure she has a cowardly lion or the scarecrow I I think that's one of the things that are struggling with right now\nIs defining her in a strong closed for the campaign I think they did incredibly well leading up to the end of this campaign here but it's been very she's struggling to define herself it's almost like she was playing prevent defense but we know what they say about prevent\nDefense yeah doesn't prevent them from winning yeah so I you know she does she is going to have to take some stands and really let people know where she is otherwise they're going to continue to define her and that'll make it a struggle down the stretch\nAbsolutely it's going to make it a struggle a the enthusiasm nationwide for the Republicans has picked up and and I I look at this caravan thing right now\nPlaying into the ... and piggybacking on the bank of you had a lot of on the back of a lot of enthusiasm that picked up for the Republicans after\nKavanaugh any kind of piqued out and like everything else two weeks later we don't even mention his name anymore we moved on to some other new craziness and then all of a sudden you've got the caravan thing and it's almost like a perfect storm just in time for the midterms is this going to really help and potentially hurt the Republicans\nI think in places like Arizona will help we we have continued to have a very extensive border discussion and I think bringing it to the forefront is definitely a Republican issue and helpful\nOr so for the most part I think it'll help in places like Arizona it'll be time will tell or in other places but the biggest thing here right now is we have this large anticipated blue wave and with three almost three hundred thousand ballots already in the door it has not materialized\nSo now it's not in fact I was looking at a couple of the people who who look at ballots rather than poles and they're just even across the country it doesn't look as promising as they I think they thought it was going to be in any political even said today there is a chance\nThat they're going to hold onto this and you're hearing the mobs and you know jobs instead of mobs hearing all of this ah there's a chance to hold onto the house and that would be a huge shocker ... if that happened uh the protests let me tonight you got a lot of people out there we got our people out there\nI I last time they were here there was tear gas there was all kinds of issues this time it seems to be a little bit more coordinated and they're keeping everybody away are you in this debate anything tonight\n[laughter] I don't think so I think will be more focused on what the president says than what the audience outside does I think which is the way it ought to be but so that the real question is does he make some sort of crack or something or is he on his good behavior this evening\nI was going to make a crack because he's a comic that goes for the joke and he can't stop themselves and I understand that I totally understand I Do I like what he does the times no do you probably not but the reality is Paul if you're in front of that audience sometimes you say stuff because you're looking for reaction\nAnd he'll do that Paul ... senior vice president researcher strategy on high ground like\nI Can't wait to have you on again I Want to get deeper into some of these uh\nUh props and stuff has to be closer to the midterms my man\nThat was a love to do that makes it much appreciate that she had been

weeks ago I think the Republicans were in the position where they felt like you know what we're not going to keep the house\nThe voter enthusiasm change they feel like they've got a chance to keep the house I think they think they're going to take a few seats in the Senate to make Sally races interesting according to new polls cinemas up by anywhere between six and eight points depending on how you're looking at the polls that is not going to help is today is she going to get a Trump bump\nAnd even though these people are voting for big Sally what's the enthusiasm soon as he asked him for

I think he answered that just fine I think so too but I had to ask I understand we know from the debate last night Martha makes Sally running for Jeff Flake seat cares and send them a running for Jeff Flake see\nMartha McSally made an announcement that the president not only will come to the east valley but now we find out he'll be visiting Luke air force base as well\nAs the Maricopa County sheriff what is your role what do you expect when the president comes to town ah because now he not only will be in the east valley he'll be in the west valley which is still your jurisdiction\nSure I mean all of a second ... is with in Maricopa County that we provide some if it were on a space such as in the past week on the fountain hills primary jurisdiction area for us as it relates to services you know we'd deputies of patrols areas\nThan we take the lead anytime is in other areas that municipality will take the lead now the unique thing about Mesa is that airport is uh some of the will to managing control so right now I Know that were available for any any support I think they have it under control\nWe are supporting other areas such as we're told us staying where um\nWhere the other events are taking place in Glendale but we're we're a secondary support team which is how it should be you know those jurisdictions\nTake the lead they let us know how we can supplement or support what they're doing and will provide those services but our swat teams are response teams and even our detention teams are available in some way shape or form a supporting that those those operations but I Would I don't want to do is I don't want to step on toes or speak over you know going to achieve who doesn't a phenomenal job with Archie singer on it\nAnd it may so remote tea so\nI'm I'm sure that they got everything wired in tight and\nBut what about Luke I I don't like whose jurisdiction is Luke air force base in how to use secure and all ready secure air force base\nYeah so that's the beauty of the choice of these locations in I don't know who you know within the state took the lead on her recommended those but because geographically structurally in in a access wise and they're already limited and prohibited so we can control as far more effectively by\nI'm going to win didn't take long noted so so representative cinema are you a Democrat\nI Am proud Democrat [noise] gosh it's hard to say proud I don't know that I'm not sure that people are even proud of parties anymore because I feel like the parties are not doing a good job so I Would say that I'm a proud Arizona and that's something I'm very proud of 'em and I'm proud of the work\nThat I have done in Washington D. C. and work I've done in the state Senate and the state house before going to Congress\nBut I'm not particularly proud of the parties ...\nBecause you know in your ads it mostly doesn't well actually I don't think I've seen a D It doesn't is that on purpose\nThat's right because I Am an independent voice for Arizona is and I want folks to 'em when they see my ads or hear from me or when I'm Talking to them and listening to them I Want them to think about who I Am as their elected official and that's our public servant\n... okay\nUm [noise] what do you think of I thought you would have told\nOr elected official and that's our public servant [laughter] okay\nUm what do you think of I thought you would have totally dodge that question I thought you would have said\nAs a Democrat I Believe in this I Believe in this I Believe in this\nThat it wasn't so independent why is it so important to make that independent leap why not say I'm not affiliated with the Democratic party won as an independent like a Joe Lieberman\nAnd do it that way tried that once remember ... ... well true but it's a different election it's more time yeah but I I I'm just surprised okay okay and that's fair that's fair but\nYou know the knock I I guess the knock against your campaign is that\nWe haven't seen you out enough we haven't you know this is the first time we've we've talked to you during this campaign during this election is that we didn't we just talk in August\nThat we talked with McCain pat when McCain has yeah but not not really about the election right yeah I\nDidn't write it right now campaigning\nWhy do you think people are saying oh you're hiding or you're not\nThink so no no you know I've been spending my time going at literally every single day to different events where I'm listening to voters and meeting voters I you guys I'm sure sock me on Twitter so you've probably seen those photos\nAnd I don't know what you're talking about [laughter]\nSo I you know I'm Out every single day on talking to voters listen to folks I was in Tucson on all day yesterday we're supposed to have a debate Martha and I\nAre in Tucson yesterday and she decided not to do it so I wanted to know debates yes I wanted one\nI think we deserve to have a debate and both Phoenix and Tucson because folks and you know both major metropolitan areas that they deserve to have their own debate I'm In the governor's race I did a debate and yet in Tucson so that's what I wanted to do [noise]\nDemocratic candidate and Arizona Senate race representative Pearson cinema joining us in Studio can we get down to the strength to do thing because this was an ad that I think was effective doesn't have to be wasn't nice I mean I'm not sitting there saying it was nice but wasn't outgrow okay what can you take us back to what the real story is the day\nWhen you were wearing a pink to do and do you regret it uh\nWell first let me say that Fifteen Years ago I was opposed to the war and this is the war in Iraq yes which is still happening ... um that what's unfortunate about what Martha chose to do in that ad was to falsely allege that I was protesting our troops and that actually\nThat was that that bothered me because you guys now that's my own brothers serve in the military right oh my big brother is a Marine I he's now retired he is the canine sergeant for the Tucson police department\nAnd I couldn't be prouder than I Am of him and my little brother is still serving in active duty today he's in the navy he's like honors made he's deployed six times in this war six times in this war\nSo I was in I I felt like if it's really unfair and so the fact checkers three fact checkers sad\nYou know Martha's clean about your son is false I have never protests our troops because that's my own family and as you guys know how seriously I take the issue of taking care of our veterans you know yes like you I'm like a dog with a bone right to take care of the men and women who serve our country so what I thought was unfortunate about\nAbout that at an in addition to my hair um was the was that the really the false allegation\nWell let me let me talk about your hair to um I thought and and my wife brought this up to me my wife was ... and and the truth be told my wife is very conservative from Wyoming very much of a you know we'll do it will take care of it ourselves can do attitude you know\nShe was appalled that a woman attacked another woman based on their dress their appearance hair you know the two to how\n... how did how did you take that because I was surprised\nA woman would attack another woman based on looks or based on what they were wearing almost like a a a shame you know are addressed shaming thing instead of saying here's some cinema voted for this I don't stand for this\nThe pick two two was brought up how did how did you feel about that or did you did you get the same reaction that my wife had a I Can't believe they're they're dead on them done in the dirt with this ah what she's wearing stuff\nWell Martha has chosen Toronto very low road on his campaign her entire campaign has been focused on personal a really dirty smears against me and false attacks and that's the road she's chosen\nUm but even when I'm not on your show you guys know that I I listen to you know that you've talked about this before and uh as you have no talked about the you mean the two two and a campaign ya ya occur and as you all have noted many times on your show I I don't campaign like that right I don't do that\nThat a ... was that a decision you made at the very beginning or is that something that evolved\nRight I don't do that was that a ... was that a decision you made at the very beginning or is that something that evolved of okay do we fight back to we attack back or know\nWho gets what I Believe in I Believe that you can have a difference of opinion with someone else\nAnd you can do it politely you can be respectful about it and you can stay focused just like your wife said on the issues in the votes every time we have ever talked\nWe've agreed some of the time and we just great sometime\nBut one thing I'll say I love coming on Mac and get us because it can be respectful we're polite to each other and our professional to each other we have a little fun we disagree and we agree that is how our system should be and I am disappointed very disappointed\nThat Martha has chosen to run a campaign based on ... attacks and we saw that\nYou know most recently in the debate mhm do you dislike mix Sally no I don't and in fact before the Senate race she and I worked together on a lot of issues we were both representing Arizona yeah and it worked together on legislation\nAbout after the church should at home and argue fuming from some of the ads that looked like I don't know I'm not you mean\nI understand that this is a political tactic that she's chosen\nI Am disappointed by it because I think it lessens the importance of what we're doing and what we're talking about in this country\nReal Arizona's have real needs right now they're not getting what they need or what they deserve from our government and what she's chosen to do in that campaign doesn't answer any questions or concerns me in line like let's get you some health care let's figure out how to get education\nWill take care of our veterans and science and focus on the issues laser focused and she's over there\nDoing these increasingly desperate activities\nGay does best of our KGAN Ninety two three of them\nIs the big Maricopa County home and

your patients finally runs out you can't quit because you're locked into a contract not so with simply safe\nSo my approach to President Trump is just that you know take it as you see it work with them and stuff you can work on the west and oppose them on the stuff you can't work on 'em with and if it's bad for Arizona you just got oppose it but you can do that as I said earlier right without being personal are mean about it you just take it like it is\nLess one you're not endorse Democrat for governor David Garcia are you voting produced we\nAlready voted but I'm not going to tell you who

them send them\nHas this re download tightly controlled and so tightly scripted at least in interviews that we have seen in the debate and I think she voted producing I'm just saying you know\nI think she's\nBut I mean so far I I I was going to uh I I didn't want to go you know I didn't want to break bad with or anything but I thought I'd have to be like look okay\nCan you just asked to answer the question we've done that and we knew from ... because they won't answer a question we had to do that this time she ... she was she was the ...\nCinema that we've had on you know for a year I see your point yeah yeah well John hook pointed out earlier this week from Fox and yeah and he joins this Monday's it three and and our conversation was about you know scarce and send them out there enough in John made a good point because she's she should use her personality\nAnd that's one of one ever really good traits and you know you could tell that she came in she had a little fun\nOr we asked her you know just about every question we had very limited time which is just how it works right we didn't get everything we wanted in\nUm she got a schedule but you know hopefully listen you listen to the show you've heard mix Sally on now you've heard cinema\nWhy do we do this what we want to give you the opportunity to listen to both women and I've said it before I think Arizona will be proud of the winter I like both women I don't like Jeff Flake okay and I'm Glad he's not going to be a senator I don't think he represents this well I think we don't have to go into that is a whole different conversation\nUm I like both women you just have to figure out as a voter who do I side with on more policies or do I want to keep Trump in check right because well I mean ... with I'm sixty two percent of the time it Sally Ninety seven percent of the time yeah but we also know that if you're a conservative you for\nYour Republican you you you want I don't know if you want to work with the other side of the I'll send them I say she's willing to work and she's proven that she can work with the other side of the aisle show I don't know if Arizona watched that right now\nDoes best of our a

you know I said I've been as business now for twenty nine years so I was actually four years old when we started and\nIt's back when I was a a you know I said I've been in his business now for twenty nine years so I was actually four years old when we started and when I was four years old [laughter]\nYou know I didn't quite you know I I never didn't think that we would be where we are today but I actually also didn't really think about that we are going to be where we are today I just kind of went with it and you know as things progressed to just kept on going so now as it's as we've come to where we are\nOn ... and I want to buy your house\nWho is this a few years ago says he could buy your house without any fees are commission can a person does this do says he could buy any house at any price hands atop despise houses in as little as three days I mean really is this the kind of man you want to do business with yeah\nWhat about his college years at ASU\nPay no attention to her and do not go to Doug Hopkins dot com to sell your house on the ... and I do not approve this president\n[noise]\n\nMoney matter can brain but of course I Am your host ...\n[noise]\nI have been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and boy how has this year been an exciting one\nWith all the stuff that's been going on and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our but love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states\nAnd uh we cherish them we value them we just enjoy the responsibility that we have to to help them with their finances to be their guide\nAnd a recently uh the barons named him walk your paypal host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states\n[noise] yes\nActually for the sixth year in a row and that again is all because of our clients so thank you guys I Hope that those if you listen to the show or having a fantastic weekend I Hope everything is just coming up roses for you and I this week a I'm a I'm Talking about something that I think is a very important it's it's very important to us but\nI'm gonna I'm applying it to you from the standpoint of how you can apply in your life and I think if you apply these principles that what'll happen is that um you know I think that you're financially you'll be successful but I also think it will be successful in life\nAnd I saw the same kind of things that it takes to have a successful business is a successful financial advisory firm I think are the same sort of things that can help you and your own life so I'm gonna tell you about our core values but at the same time I'm I'm gonna apply them to you and hopefully you can get some some benefit from that as well\nSo this segment I'm In Thailand you are the most important person in the entire world so as I mentioned in the previous segment I we we not work with a uh a thousand families and and you know when you think about how many people that is you've got grandparents children grandchildren and in some cases great grandchildren\nIt really becomes like a whole community of people that were responsible for\nAnd for us not to think about how do we make what we do indoor\nHow can we keep money matters in during a it would be irresponsible of of us you know with regard to our clients and and their families so we we have we called vision one hundred which means that a hundred years from now we want our for our money matters to be as strong are stronger than it is today and to do that we have to establish you know who we are\nWhat we stand for how we behave\nAnd then whatever changes technology economy markets brings it doesn't matter it's how you behave it's what you do it's your values so in your family it it would be the equivalent of again of teaching your kids and your grandchildren et cetera\nThis is what our morals are this is what we value this is what's important in life and if you apply these they will transcend time they will transcend technology et cetera so\nThis segment is you are the most important person in the world so we have to core values that applies that number two number for some core value number two says that our clients benefit before we do\nNow I Believe that in life if you are selfless if everything you do is geared around helping others that what happens if it comes back to you\nYou are selfless if everything you do is geared around helping others\nThat what happens if it comes back to you tenfold I don't know how it works it's this magic that happens it's sometimes called karma sometimes it's called the golden rule it it's there's it's what reaping and sewing I mean religions talk about it all the time\nAnd if you focus entirely on bet if any of those around you\nIt it will come back to you and I think a lot of the success that we've had is because that's our philosophy that's how we live\nSo that core value our clients benefit benefit before we do um we have a weekly meetings that we have with our senior financial ah partners or our senior partners where we talk about\nStrategy we talk about uh you know what we're going to do it given market conditions and all those kinds of things and in that meeting we have a chair it's an empty chair but it belongs to our clients\nAnd what we say is we want to always imagined that a client is sitting in that room with us while we're having this meeting\nAnd we always used that as our litmus test that clients sitting in that room with us with day approve of what we're saying in this meeting or would they think that we're a bunch of cats [laughter] okay are we like a ... we want them to be proud of us at all times\nSo this kind of goes to behave as if somebody's watching you all the time behave as if what you're doing is is is impacting others because when you start looking inwardly then you start becoming self that you start becoming in were you close up and you close up\nOpening to all the opportunities that are out there for you core value number four says if a client calls us we lost\nAnd what I mean by that is is that\nIf people rely on you ... you know you have to think of yourself as their servant you know we feel like we work for everybody you know I'm the c._e._o. of are from but I feel like I'm the employee of every person that works at our firm\nI'm here to facilitate them I'm here to make sure that they can do their job the best that they can I work for everyone you know I'm not I'm no one's boss\nAnd it's the same thing with our clients we want to be proactive so when we say if the client calls us we lost what I mean by that is that if a client calls us about something that we should have told them about already\nThen we lost so if there was a mistake made or if there's something going on the markets or anything that a client would call us about\nWe should be a head of that we should be pro active leak communicating with our clients in advance so they don't have to call us so therefore if a client cause us we lost now of course there are things that are clients going to call us about that we have no way of knowing right they moved or you know there's a change in their life or something happened\nThose situations obviously if a client cause us we didn't lose but anything that we should have told them first we did lose so in your life I think about people and uh how you run your business or if you're a if you work you know your boss your the people that a report up to you your peers\nKeep them informed about what's going on don't ever let somebody call you and say hey what's going on with that\nWhen you told them you were on top of it keep them informed at all times and you'll give them peace of mind do trust you and you'll be ... and I think you'll be happier in the process as well that there is no doubt\nOkay now we are a financial advisory firm or not a a philosophical firmly do apply but we're what we preach uh and uh we uh would like to work with you if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon so this is you then that's who we [laughter]\nWe\nSpecialize in working with so if you have questions about your pension plan do you take a pension or a lump

Chandler by going online to money matters dot net again\nPaying attention to her and do not go to Doug ... dot com so you're out some dug up and and I do not approve this message\nUm [noise] [noise]\n\n\nMoney\nAnd we are back this is money matters that can rape and of course I Am your host ...\n[noise] thank you\nJack I've been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are\nThe same ideas we talk about what our love it and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states and Forbes named our financial advisory from one of the top one hundred financial advisory firms in the United states [noise]\n\nAndme wars without our ... and most of your clients I Would be nowhere and so therefore you guys listening right now thank you so much now one of the things that uh you know I've been the theme of our show this week is that\nI Believe that as a financial advisor from you as you grow and you take on families that are you're doing their financial work for you have a great deal of responsibility\nYou know we as I said with a thousand families that that's a lot of people that we are responsible for and that responsibility is is something we don't take lightly and one of the things we don't want to have happen is your financial advisory front die before you do okay that would be bad\nSo we created will be called vision one hundred which is that we want money matters to be here a hundred years from now and be a strong then as it is today not stronger\nAnd to do this I studied a lot of companies that have endured over a hundred years and the thing they all have in common is it had a very strong set of core values a strong set of things that they believed and that they live by you know think about the Marines the Marines have a very very strong\nCore set of values they know that if they are bad if they are alone there never alone that their brothers will find them no matter what it is their culture that that's what they do\nTherefore they can go into battle with the confidence that the people that they're going in with are there and they will lay down their lives for them as they would for that for them so that is a culture that is the values that you stand for and if you're not willing to do that you get booted out very quickly from that organization or or or the or the Marines\nSo the same sort of thing in your life as you think about the things that you stand for you know that you would teach your children your grandchildren that you would want them to to learn as to what is it about your values your morals your family that\nYou stand for and and these are the things that endure over time regardless of how the economy is doing regardless of what technology is doing regardless of what's going on these are the things that endure over the course of time\nNow one of the things that are we believe in in terms of managing our clients money is we want we want our clients we want you to grow your money but\nWe want you to keep what you would you built we want you to grow your money with confidence and so because of that we have a strategy that we call by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also sell and the reason why we do that\nWe have a strategy that we call by holding cell and by holding cell means that you don't just buying hold you also sell and the reason why we do that is because you know you can make tons of money you can invest in you know think of bitcoin for example okay some people invested in bitcoin inside go up to whatever\nAnd then now it's come way way down\nIf you if you bought near the top and it grew and you're thinking look at that I made twenty five percent and then the whole thing last then you could be down [laughter] you know you've lost money on the deal so you don't have anything until you actually sell it that's when you realize the value that you've created in this investment\nSo therefore what's on paper makes you feel good you think you've got it but really it's it's when you sell it that it actually becomes something that is of value so therefore to protect our clients we have a by holding cell philosophy now\nAren't we have ten core values and I want to share with your core value number three okay which is take only as much risk as is necessary to accomplish your financial goals now the reason why we say that is because risk is not your friend\nOkay and and taking high risk in the search for high returns is not really your friend okay people who take high risk you know they get lucky and or they'll hit one and then they'll try it again and then they want and they had the cycle of bankruptcy and growth in Pakistan ...\nSo what we tell us what we tell people in fact we say this at our seminars is that if if the goal is to make the highest return possible\nThen here's what I recommend sell all of your investments okay go out just go on the Internet right now sell everything you've got turned it all into cash but in a suitcase and we'll meet up next Tuesday and what we'll do is we'll all get on a bus and we'll go to Las Vegas together okay everybody with our little suitcases full of money\nAnd then when we get to Las Vegas we are going to go to the roulette wheel and we're going to bed at all on red\nOkay we're big bat now if we hit we're going to make a ton of money we're going to be one very rich group of people\nBut the problem is it may not be read in which case will be a very poor group of people [laughter] so do you want the highest returned Vegas awaits but somewhere between burying it in the backyard you know in a can and going to Las Vegas in betting at all on red lies how much risk you should take\nAnd our goal philosophically\nIn life and I think your goal in life should be the same thing is take only as much risk as it is necessary to accomplish your goals\nWe love you baby [laughter] well I Love you back because if you take more risk than is necessary to accomplish their goals what what you're doing their you know the market has a way if you're you're being greedy okay and if you think back to that movie years ago Wall Street with Michael Douglas races greed is good\nWell you know what\nThe stock market has a way of spanking greedy people's bottoms bright red you know you get those red cheeks like a ... you don't want that that's not a pretty sight okay you don't want bright red cheeks so take only as much risk in your life in your finances in all areas that is that is necessary to accomplish their goals otherwise\nSo we try to push our clients down to the least amount of risk that we can take with their investments and still accomplish their goals\nSo making four percent a year makes you secure financially then you know what that's all we need we're not going to go chasing after ten or Fifteen Percent and the risk that comes with that it's just not worth it\nOn the other hand if you're if we need to make six percent then we'll take a little more risk than we would with somebody who only needs for okay so take only as much risk as it's necessary to accomplish their goals\nOkay so that's our core value number three that
