turned\nUp fantastic we're going to talk about that we're going to\nSee them and harass him a little later on uh we're not going to appoint any fingers or um or even bring up any names but it does rhyme with ... made me [laughter] but I was this is the home of a free book your personal guide to buying a home\nIf you've been sitting on the fence just curious in interested about what the home buying process is like here in the state of Arizona\nThis is your solution to this is your answer all you got to do is pick up your phone and we're not even going to make a call if you want a free copy we're gonna come you're going to cost a physical book we're going to put this in your hands all you gotta do is ... book\nDo for one one Ninety two three that's a book a two for one one Ninety two or three All right so if you excuse me for a moment few moments I Want to I'm just going to educate everybody here oh no yeah what kind of what kind of there's a there's a lot of things a lot of talk\nA lot of discussion of what's going on\nA not only in the real estate market or but but more so in in our economy and I think people are getting somewhat confused because what we're seeing right now is um\n... ... you know consumers are running under the impression that the market's going to bust\nAnd they're waiting for the market to bust and we're sitting on the fence we're not getting into the real estate game 'cause we're waiting for the market to bust people and the other side who are in ... number one this is what I learned\nA lesson I always tried to teach my kids is always consider yourself consider your source of information\nOkay where did you get the information that you're making your argument you're basing your argument from\nAnd so for those people that are just anticipating waiting for the market to bust my question is where are you getting that information who is your source\nYou know and consider the source of information because the things that we read the people that were talking to the economists that we're studying are not anticipating a real estate market buff as a matter of fact when you take a look at appreciation appreciation across the board here in the great state of Arizona\nHas been at its normal healthy appreciation rate you know and and can average anywhere from three to seven percent that is a healthy rate that is where the appreciation needs to be\nUm what we're seeing and when you're hearing about people talking about a correction in the market we're talking about them not the real estate market what we're talking about the economy do we anticipate a correction yes and when we when we\nWhen we anticipate a reset of the market I think for some maybe disposable cash is going to go down it's going to impact disposable spending or extra spending it's going to impact people at a personal level but what is not impacting and what is not anticipating to impact the jury is the real estate market\nThat's right I'm just here trying not to laugh at a radio guy I'm looking at these glasses\nThis collapse of the best at her my gosh I Wish everyone could see right now\nI [laughter]\nI think they're not clown glasses we need especially the ones that are there in the back of my iPhone case there are these little plastic reader so\nWhen I'm Out in about know right onto his nose and it was certainly I later [laughter]\nAgain radio guy [laughter] no but I think everybody\nJust you know it's like their prediction of the future right because they have watched with the market his dad and they said oh will happen before it's gonna happen again everybody has their own theories about everything and\nI hear so much out there it's amazing how much I hear everybody has their own theory well where did you hear that from oh well my sister so you know wherever brother's friend\nAnd I think that it there's not a lot of people out there really getting information from the correct sources and that's really the main reason we're here to get correct information out to help people realize they're real estate goals this is a strong real estate market and we'll is yes yes it is\nGo ahead and text or locked two for one one Ninety two three that's Locke to for one one Ninety two\nThree is you're All right so let's talk about the fall I Love this time of year for buyers\nBecause I'm In one one thing I I think one of the things that people don't understand about Phoenix and and the real estate climate here in Phoenix weary very very seasonal\nMarket there are times of the year that are busier for buyers and sellers and other times of the year\nI've always maintained a jury that if you're looking to buy this may not be the time to sell but if you're looking to buy you want to be you want to buy during the slower market because homes are sitting on the market a little bit longer sellers of getting a little more desperate little more anxious to offload their property\nAnd and so there I think are better deals and more deals to be had yet sometimes cells are hearing people oh well it's a slower time of the year ... time of the year so they naturally equate that well I don't want to them by now I Want to wait till it's a busy time of year will the busy time you're going to get they're not going to get as good a deal I think this is the time to really get into it well\nThis is also the time that only serious fires are out looking once we get into the holidays I mean for the most\nPart are you just drop the gauntlet you're only if you're looking to buy now you're serious fire\nYou are very very serious I was I just had a listing of climate where I that was the advice I gave an you know I have to say I think that it used to be a little bit more um you know oh it's Christmas Time it's not a good time to lift your home I don't know what has changed a lot of people don't\nCare so much about not looking for home during the holidays but it it isn't it's not that knowledge as much when someone serious it's that it doesn't matter and so if you put your house on the market you may not have as many showing that the people who are looking are really looking to buy so I\nI think it's a good time to put your house on the market if you are looking to to sell and I think that it's a great time as a buyer because there's not as many buyers\nAre I think this is one of the best times a year to be a buyer and not as much competition ... exactly and and so the best way to start\nAnd we'd been talking about it for years we've had thousands of our kids to your listeners take advantage of our free book offer so make that same offer to our listeners today the habit Texas were booked for one one Ninety two three cars how we work at our on our team is Sherrie\nIs we're we're not a traditional real estate team traditional real estate agents or our primary our main and primary focus is to help educate and help our listeners understand what the ... process is like that is why we haven't no obligation no strings attached free offer and that is our book your personal guided by homeless than actual physical book\nWe will make arrangements to get a two year we love to personally deliver to you will take the time it come out and really just you know if you'd like having a discussion talk about strategy on on finding that next right home but we do want to put a free copy book and your hands\nIn order to get that all you got to do again is ... book two for one one Ninety two three again ... book to for one one Ninety two three well\nJust you know kind of continuing on with that conversation about this\nTheme operational Haitian that's later ... [laughter]\nBut I think I I Do people who are are thinking about what they want to do I think this is maybe a time that they might say hey the holidays are coming up I'll just put that on the back burner and I'll Wait until January\nAnd as you just mentioned this is such a great time but not having as much competition means is that when you go to write an offer you might not have to pay quite as much for a home because you're not competing with another offered that may potentially becoming and\nYou have a seller who wants to hurry and sell their house they don't want to be showing their house during Christmas Time there are lots of reasons that you have great negotiating power to by now and we also know what the interest ...\nThese houses are going to sit on the market a little bit longer than usual\nThat's right and and another thing is we know what the interest rates are now they're they're sitting in a good place now we don't know what they're going to be in two thousand Nineteen so fact this is a great time to look into purchasing a home if you've been waiting for a good deal\nYou ever er and again if you do with like a copy of her free book again oh you got to do is to explore booked two for one one Ninety two three that's book two for one one Ninety two\nThree you know sometimes you get into these situations where you're sitting with a salesperson whether it's a car salesman a timeshare salesman maybe even another real estate agent\nAnd you feel bad\nUh if if you use up a little bit of their time and then you're not ready to to move forward I remember a couple of years ago\nUh we had a and I don't want to call them by name but we had this one of these big flooring companies come in you you've heard him on the radio\nAnd these ads in these ... songs and so forth so they come in and they do the little presentation and my wife and I we just want to think about it and and so we can really feel like we've got guilt into it like\nHis children were going to die of starvation in the event that we didn't find the dotted line and I remember afterwards and the quality of the foreign socked but that's neither here nor there I'm like ...\nOne of the things that we do and one of things we specialize in our program here is we will drop off the book Jerry we'll sit down and have a strategy session with you will even set you up with her proprietary search functions on our Web sites that are mobile apps and so forth and if you're not reading and if you don't want to ... there's no guilt we're here to educate we're here to help [noise]\nThat's right and I you know that's the thing is I I Wish everybody felt like that I felt like yeah where they they're worried about wasting our time in real estate yeah sure right always the case but but I Do think that we have I'm\nSitting there but the point I Want to be clear we're sitting down we're having a strategy session with you're talking with you your future goes it's not just it's not a waste of time for us we love to help people well\nAnd the other thing is there's just a natural obligation you feel if someone takes the time to come to your home and asked you questions you feel like okay now what am I supposed to do for you just feed me that well my aunt food yeah the ...\nBut really it's just you know keep us in mind if you if you have any questions in the future we're here to

knowledgeable you'll know what your options are and you'll decide whether or not you want to proceed based on accurate information\nWell and I think it's important to point out too is that you know in this day of technology a lot of people like to just do things quickly and so getting online and do an application might seem a little bit easier and more convenient\nBut that's what I like about my clients I tell them you need to have a conversation with Amy or Christie because\nTalking to them in person you can sort through things maybe a computer can do right away so much easier and it kind it saved all of us from a headache or disappointment we don't want to get somebody really excited about an interest rate they may qualify for us or point yeah maybe they don't think they have to jump through hoops now that free qualification can be a little bit deceiving the talking to you and asking the right questions\nOnly takes about another ... an additional five or ten minutes and we get the information that we need\nAbsolutely and you know I I really um I had a customer this week that I've been working with since may um he moved here from Nebraska we had some you know he had he had some job issues we had to work through and help them with that\nHe's been under contract and they came up they had some infection issues\nAnd so I Know and I'm just yesterday and I said you know before you and your realtor come to terms on how you want to negotiate with what the seller let me know what they are willing to do because we may want to reduce the sales price a little bit and then use the remaining money to pay your closing costs and that put that money back in your pocket seats need the money for repairs so just\nYou know we work through the whole thing and this question was what are closing costs yeah [laughter] but you know we we are we were able\nTo show him the benefit of all how he should structure that reduction in and cost for art if\nYou want to have a one of these conversations with wanting to be kept on Christie it's very evident\nAnd obvious uh we've got a lot of experience in this field know what they're talking about can definitely help you if you're looking for a little guidance little advise or at the very least wanting to find out if you can qualify for home encourage you to took sword fun\nTo for one one Ninety two three Texan would fund for one one Ninety two to three want to put you in touch with funny and kept on Christie our friends from home a bridge\nYou know I Try not to make that that a lot of people don't realize that they have options even when they're going to purchase and you build\n'em and that that this is something else that they can do so we had um\nThan any here just stepped in a client that I have that's making a very large purchase with a builder and they've been going along the process and didn't realize that they had so many different options now they're getting a better rate they're putting less money down they're much happier with the processing there's been a lot more communicative and these are just things that they didn't realize because when you go to the builders office everything seems so\nSay oh I don't have no option that's right well and I want to I Want to add onto that lady's because one of one of the things it's like um you know it's like if you if you have a cold\nCase it doesn't really matter\nWhere you go doesn't matter who at the doctor's offices you or it doesn't matter whether you go to a twenty four hour your place or ... you know whatever you call those places it it it doesn't really matter because we're we're talking about a cold\nAnd when you're making small purchases uh whether you know it's a laundry soap or ... or ... or barbecued tools you don't ever falls okay it's great to go on line it's great to be able to push a button you don't need to talk to anybody but when we're talking about a a serious purchase\nA like buying a home where you're borrowing two three four hundred thousand dollars or going back to the medical example we're now when you're talking about when you're having her problems in in a major problem\nYou know it doesn't matter where you where you go and it does matter of getting a second opinion and getting a third opinion because it's a major decision who's ever going to operate on your major decision will buying a home I'm telling you\nThe last thing you want to do is rely on a website to spit out a report spit out this without that spit out your options\nAre because there are certain things that I Know we're going all digital and everything's all about technology they're still certain things in life\nWhere you need a live person who can examine and evaluate your personal situation and give you the best solution so I say this for those of you who just relying on the Internet or a big box bank that shuts down at five and you can't talk to somebody on the weekends\nAnd in order to evenings when you're agents taken out it's time for me for the second third opinion\nWell and and I think that goes to the same thing with the builder to for someone else to tell you what ... what led her to use so so shop around get get some options and we love for you to talk to our friends here because we've have trusted them for how long it's\nTrusted them for how long have you been working with him oh thirty two hundred years [laughter] that's funny 'cause I just turned\nForty okay well thirty nine and out\nHere and the only thing that I mean I Do we we have a lot of conversations we talk about\nWhat our competitions doing what's on the Internet\nSo we're we understand what's going on out there and and there's so much in the fine print that people don't understand it like\nOh wow you know I can get a rate at four percent well yeah and it's going to cost you a three point you know so I really do that to do that but you know we we push in the best deal and then then what the deal that makes sense for you for your long term goals\nAnd if you're if you're sitting on a program a pre qualification maybe that you that you got online uh maybe from another lender but you know all that it doesn't seem right and I talked to people all the time it just doesn't seem right that they seem like there might there has to be better\nOptions out there or you just got something from a website or the very least you know what I'm give our friends at home bridge funny be kept on Christie just the opportunity to give you a second look\nTo give you a second opinion uh because this isn't a major financial decision that

something about when I put his hat off it made me feel like Superman made\n... favorite superhero stop and frisk does not help the relationship we can do it a different way can yeah I'm totally of we have to release the love of liberal will try to control a black person to the concept of race and I love this guy right there if you don't look good\nWe don't look good so you might not have expected to have a crazy mother like Congress was\nThat was pretty impressive\nI Love this guy right [laughter]\nThat's the hard I didn't want to put you in that position [laughter] with us from the heart special guy\nOur special guy yeah wow it was it was crazy it was chaotic Jim round was there to buy them so they interviewed Jim Brown afterwards and he said and here's a guy who was you know this is the guy who face\nRacism\nIn a way that a younger generation has not face no matter how much they want to scream and yell about all the micro aggressions and stuff if we're honest with ourselves a grandpa great grandfather great great grandpa face raises and the kind of racism which\nIs thank goodness slowly but surely it's never going to be gone but it sure the hell water isn't what it once was and they asked him and this was a guy who was an outspoken civil rights leader at a time and he had his issues as well uh Jim Brown the great football player but first of all I kept calling ... a ... a ...\nBut he uh he said like I don't think anybody should Neal we're a family and we need to figure things out 'cause they talked about yes a policing all\nKinds of thing it was all over the place and at times it was surreal\nKanye was holding court and it was interesting but he says and and people always say why is the right obsessed with Kanye and they're so happy for them and I said it's not the fact that he likes the president doesn't like the president because I don't think he agrees everything with the president I really don't but the fact is is he's got a platform\nHe likes some of the stuff their egos match each other right there ... both married to a powerful women and and and they may they get each other right like they get each other but\nIt's the fact that he doesn't go in step into with the left\nThat he's willing to go I really don't care I'm doing my own thing\nRight I'm doing my own thing but something ... and and and I said this to to a couple of ... to me it's like why are you guys so obsessed and I said it's because you cheered him when he said George Bush hates black people write you cheered him but now when he's not on that same kind of path you're pissed off and angry\nRight he then he was a genius now he's insane so that's what you're going to do but he said something that and I said even if he's insane guys just want to understand this\nJust because he may have some screws loose and he was kind of all over the place today doesn't mean that some of the stuff he's not saying doesn't have valid points\nWhere I Am a Saturday Night live to approve or the liberals improve on it if you don't we don't look good\nTrump told the truth is is right and I live and that is true some I've been saying\nSomething I've been saying over and over and over and over and over again but we want to see the other side's fail\nIt's ridiculous\nIt is absolutely ridiculous to want to see the other side fall apart\n\nBecause that's the way you feel you can get power is ridiculous the hope that the president fails to Bill Maher saying I Hope we have a recession the people cheering fourteen hundred points coming off the Dow in two days because they're hoping this happens is insane that's that is for that is not patriotic is at all\n... not\nIt's it's it's a sad sad thing but he was all over the place he was a the hats thing was just just crazy they talked about all kinds of stuff uh you know and and to me it was it was it was surreal moment in the White House\nWe may everything it's not an America that were cheating on our country and we're putting people in\nThe legal they ended up she factory on the president's [laughter]\nYeah I mean it's different I mean he he\nSaid a lot of stuff that I think it was a bit out there like that's one of one of the reasons that people make stuff cheap everywhere and Trump even fact checked him on Foxconn and a few other things but some of the reasons that people do the things that they do like go elsewhere is because we hear demand cheap goods but I understand what he was trying to do\nAnd I think he said some stuff today that was real and it just because you don't like him because he's not on your team anymore as far as what goes because he's wearing a make America great again hat just because of that doesn't mean that all the things that he thinks should be discounted because a lot of times\nIt's true right\nBut he had to go off on some wacky tangents they did he did he absolutely did he went off in some crazy stuff and you're just like he said he's bipolar but not bipolar is a genius to test the Ninety eight percent dial\nHe was all over the place you showed Trump stuff on phones 'cause apparently wants to design cars I don't know it is what it is but it was a surreal moment in the White House today\nIt's ... Jim you've heard me talking about my friends are treated well for a while now well here's your chance to see face to face how they can help you prepare for you\nYou prepare for your retirement\nIf you're over fifty and you wonder if you're on track to retire if you know Social Security won't be enough if you have questions regarding your options and you're looking for a fiduciary will put your interests first well\nThe question is why where is the what happened to this guy\nI can understand why make cautious but [noise] um I Do things that are over the next several days it's likely that that a tenor will change a little bit\nWe'll see we'll see but the the thought processes that they may put an end to it as another one of those I mean the last couple of weeks we've seen what we had the Interpol guy right now this is it's very bizarre and they just disappear and what happened what took place where\nDid they take him I mean going into an embassy and then boom gone\n\nAnd what happens is a hundred and ten billion dollar deal that they kill somebody else is going to get I saw people they going he value human life more I mean he values money more than the other human life we're not talking I mean this is a this is a massive deal\nFor a lot of people whose lives depend on this kind of stuff but Saudi Arabia let's be real we like them because they hate the Iranians that's it they ... they the Iranians that's why we like that\nThat's it\nHow many of the Nineteen remember that remember remember nine eleven remember that remember all of them\nHow many of them were from Saudi Arabia there's some issues here absolutely but\nTrump's looking at it in a different way of saying well you know what it sounds horrible we need to figure this entire thing out we've got to start figuring this thing out and saying that it's a hundred and ten million dollars that's that's a lot of money can be coming to the United states and they're going to spend it and there may spend it with somebody else and those those those people are going to get the money\nChina or Russia and what are they going to do it\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you\nSo a very interesting the the whole question of the day is one of third parties you know when I saw one today you know you've got Kanye in there and he's doing his Kanye stuff 'cause that's what ... does and it was interesting was holding court\nUh but my question is you know why can't we talk to one of the civility is gone and we're going to dig deeper into a little bit later but we need a solid\n\nThird party and here's the thing that I talked about before when it comes to authorities we don't need a third party that's equal you can make a lot of noise\nBeing strong and small meaning if you took twenty seats thirty seats in the house maybe five or six seats in the Senate right you take anywhere between you know you've got intend to Fifteen Percent\nYou can do a lot of things you can\nCan do a lot of things and I think we need a real party and I'm Talking about the Green Party right with Jill Stein I'm not talking about Gary Johnson because God\nThat he just it was awful ... just admitted right like can we right I'm not talking about ... insane although everyday film laughed at me like you see just wants to talk about going that's why he's running for president block jade\nAnd said I'm going to talk of what I'm Talking about somebody and the party that is real but I think could it you know can see all sides and is there more for the most of the times I think the referee and the random in the mature party will call [laughter]\n[noise] what do you think though would you be open and could you be open to a third party that's not insane that's not crazy but a real party fifty percent of you so far so yes I can four percent say no forty six percent says depend on the politics and I think the politics would be very much an independent minded\nLook at things and so let's just say let's let's break this down how this would work\nSo you've got a party that is somewhat in power right that has the most you can get a plurality just your right but you've got a party that's got then you've got another party here so the Republicans Democrats one of those who's going to have the most seats the second seats is going to be the other one is the third\nIs the one that's going to be swayed because you know those two can't stand each other and right now it's worse than ever before so what ends up happening is they're going to have to come to you to get stuff done\nAnd if you're able to say look I understand what you're doing there and I agree with this this and this but you know what if you want our vote you had to get rid of this you gotta get rid of this you got to get rid of this because I see it from their side too so it is a way to\nIt is a way to move things through and that might be the best way to break the gridlock\n\nIn many ways just like being an independent who do both sides cater to come election time\nWho was the vote they need the independence because they're the ones that are going to sweat 'cause we're so driven and separated right now they got to come and they gotta go okay okay okay ... we need your vote what do we have to do\nI think in a bigger way if we can do something like this I think I Would change the law three two three five three twenty four twenty three at checkpoints and show is your Twitter babysitting while black\nI'm babysitting right after I got I got two kids and the fact that women are made with him and his lady across the street with somewhere warmer this lady over here to follow on me because I've got two kids and the vaccines that does not look like me\nSo that guy right there cordless his name and he is babysitting and he doesn't mentoring program and and you know he looks to be in his mid twenties early thirties kind of thing and he's got like a eight and ten year old boy and girl in the back and they happen to be white and he happens to be black and there's a woman who\nIs worried that these two kids have been taken away snatched from their parents because stranger danger is everywhere\nThis lady said it upon herself to say that she's going to say my play them and caught a polling praises\nThe twenty eighth thing and this is what I got to do it I Can't go out with two kids that do not look what I mean in in without something weird to see the latest movie feels harassing me because I have two kids that do not look like [noise]\nYeah so she's following them and it's a very weird situation okay first of all it takes them the subway and then he takes them to Wal Mart if you're going to kidnap somebody right like let's just say I've seen enough kidnapping shows to know that\n\nYou're probably not going to take um outdoors right like they used to put him in a room where you can't scream and they've got the room sound proved those kind of thing like if you're going to do that that you're not like hey before we get to this part where I totally kidnap you and take you and how'd you forever\nWhy don't we go get a sub sandwich we'll talk about what your kidnappings they'd be like maybe go to Wal Mart we can get you some stuff to kind of just chill time you know you're probably not going to do that and now we live in the world to see something say something I get that but here's my thing\nWith is if it's a white guy with two black or Asian kids are Hispanic kids they're probably thinking oh he adopted them or that's a good thing that they're doing their\nYeah now\nI also think that gender has something to do with it because I think if it was a black woman with two white kids I don't think anybody would have cared as much so I think there's a little you know like it's a gender thing but this was ridiculous eventually the lady called the ...\nLet's say the police have to say about this\nFairly she's ... she's\nAs a Walmart yeah maybe I got some of them babies and we ate is a ... or Walmart\nWhen got some guy to pull it up talking about some of it is okay to laugh when I came back after this little girl so she can ask cursing the snow who I Am and then I went over to get some gas and Murphy she came back their\nVoices and saying they're going for a year ago\nYeah and and eventually the police do you guys OK and they're like yeah you know and they called the parents or the mom of of the kids and the mom thought it was a joke she's like what this is a joke right and they're like no this is for real\nIt it'll be made into something big uh I I I said take a step\nBack again we live in the world of see something say something and if it was a white guy with two black kids probably not having the\nSame issue I don't know maybe but you know if it's a white guy with two Asians you know two little Asian kids probably like I say Hispanic is probably thinking and I also say if it was a black woman with white kids probably wouldn't have said anything it might be just you know what might be a gender thing more than anything else think about that\nDay at ...

[noise]\nWell you know what are those of you are old enough to remember Matt Dillon from gun smoke there was an episode that I'll never forget and the famous line or at least for me that he said he said man who's not afraid he's a fool [laughter]\nIf it's a total fixer upper were perfect conditions just go to Doug ... for your free cash offer and make sure to check out the flipping roasting

the bonanza of the airways we share with you the golden nugget of financial information every week I wrote that I'm proud of it as bad as it was I take full responsibility [noise] um\nAnd about this I Know\nWell how it is very silly incredibly silly [noise]\nSo uh as I was saying I had been a a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talked about with our beloved and most valued clients\nWe not work with over a thousand four hundred beautiful families and we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon ah so that's where our focus is and so therefore all the things that uh you know in that arena we want to help people with\nAnd that we're we're blessed to be able to do that and in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisor for money matters one of the top one hundred and wealth managers and once again without our clients we would be nowhere so you guys thank you thank you thank you I'm\nOne of the views that we have philosophically of how we\nHelp our clients so when it comes to financial advising you know you you you invest money obviously that's part of what you do is you want to help your clients with their vestments diversification risk profiles all that kind of stuff but then that's that's a a component of it but there's more okay because there's also you want to help to build a cash\nFlow plan right you want to look at how you're going to get income when you're retired and then you want to have a risk assessment so if you're doing proper plant up financial planning in my opinion you need to look at the risks that your client is going to face during their retirement and you want to build a plant around that to address the risk that you think they are most likely to face\nAnd if\nYou do that because the word plant right we plan for the worst and hope for the best uh that's how we operate so uh and believe it or not there are Eighteen risks\nThat you face\nOkay when you're retired it's probably more but but there's a there's a team that that we that we look at okay and so we can talk about number six this week which is frailty risk and what I mean by ...\nIt's it's the result of deteriorating mental or physical health okay so this is when a person is not able to make sound judgment and managing their financial affairs or they may be unable to take care of\nThemselves at their home so you know and and this is kind of a not a fun topic obviously but ah at University of Michigan study shows that one third of the people over the age of sixty five suffer from frailty\nAnd so therefore frailty in retirement is a real risk and and you know even though we don't want to think about these kinds of things\nAs your financial advisor my job is to do that okay so it and and the problem with it is it impacts people early in retirement because a third of people over the age of sixty five according to study\nOr have frailty a third okay so\nThe majority of retirees will suffer from frailty at some point during the retirement now in a in England they did a study which shows that the longer you are retired the more your mental health decreases so working longer can help hold off frailty\nSo therefore the risk of frailty can be exacerbated and that if you retire if you you know and a lot of people strive to retire early well guess what don't [laughter] okay you don't want to do that\nSo uh ... uh one risk as being asked to retire by your company earlier than you had planned right and the increased cost and all that so here's some solution so first of all\nIt costs and all that so here's some solutions to first of all\nUh make sure you know who in the case if you do have\nAny issues there um who's going to step in and make those decisions and do that for you okay so is it a family member or you're going to hire a financial advisor and you know we have quite a few clients\nWho have come in and told us that the reason you know for example ... it's a generational thing obviously uh but uh people in their sixties right now for the most part the husband handled the financial affairs\nAnd a lot of the husbands are concerned that if something happened to them that their wife would not be able to handle the finances as well as they did 'cause they kinda did the whole thing\nAnd so if if the husband or whoever the CFO for the family is is then or now not able to what's going to happen next so we have quite a few clients who are with us simply because they want to have an establish relationship now\nGiving someone control is done normally through a power of attorney so you want to have the power of attorney that gives somebody the power to make financial decisions for you in the event that you are not able to um and that's called a durable power of attorney\nYou might also consider having living trust okay because what a living trust does it names a trustee and so therefore if you are incapable of continuing as trustee you've already named who's going to step in and what the rules are et cetera\nSo this is a very good second option in in one that we recommend in in a lot of states I'm now you also in the pre planned the documents\nThat describe\nThe things that uh would cause you to be incompetence okay so you want to have in their ... of daily living and you and therefore uh this is called the guardianship document which basically spells out\nYou know not the financial decisions that need to be made but who's going to feed you drive you you know all those kinds of things again this isn't a pleasant topic I Know but if you're gonna be financially sound I think you need to think about all the things that could impact you negatively and if you have that taken care of if you plan to head for that\nThen you know hopefully it won't happen but if it does it doesn't you know devastate your situation All right I don't know how to say I think we accept that I think you know so a couple of more tips one is make sure your finances are simplified\nYou know we tell clients you consolidate things make it easy for others to be able to find it all you know if you have stuff spread out over Seventeen different custodians and you've got accounts all over the place that's fine for you because you're smart and you've got your spreadsheet and your little list and all that\nBut can others recreate what you've done probably not and so you know do them a favor consolidated all that stuff simplify it and make it easy for somebody else to step in and take over the responsibilities\nAnyway now that's a risk number six and I hope that helps you now again we have all the risks are the first five of us are risks and this one uh posted on our website so you can go find them if you'd like to read them or listen to the podcast\nThe ... one thing I'd like to do is to invite you to come in and visit with one of our financial advisors I think you'll find them to be a knowledgeable friendly and incompetent and they uh they want to help you with your retirement planning All right so we want to talk with you about the important decisions that you need to make\nIf you come in and visit we also want to develop for your cash flow of analysis and that I think is the most important thing that you do when it comes to retirement is is a cash\nFlow analysis and what I mean by that is you want to look at the sources of income you're going to have the expense is you're going to have\nAnd do you have the money to support the difference and uh that analysis unfortunately I think a lot of people don't do but it's a starting point for us okay we want to know that you have the cash flow to cover your cost of living if you don't then we want to talk about well how do we get there what are the things we need to do to do that\nSo that takes into account Social Security or four oh one K. your retirement

Chandler by going online to money matters dot net when it comes to refinancing\nYour home and even more money in your pocket when you want a company that has your back that company that stands by their word\n\nMe [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI Am in our for ever [noise] and we are back does money matters with Ken All right but of course I Am your host ...\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talked about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about what our love it and most valued clients\nAnd now we we work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is a a just a an honor and privilege\nAnd we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon\nMost of our focus is on that retirement planning and so is this show and so that's you then we're here for you\nEnd up for the second year in a row now money matters or with Ken rape that would be our firm is a finalist where finalists or ... or the two thousand Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch awards for ethics which is a mouthful\nBut basically uh we are up for it for the second year in a row as an award winner for the better Business Bureau toward toward for ethics [noise]\nYes and the winters will be announced November first at the awards ceremony and I'll tell you whether we win it or not that we're\nUm I think honored just to be in the running to win it which is a a good thing because you know in our business I think ethics in in all businesses but particularly in our business I think ethics are very very important [noise]\nAnyway um we're going to talk now about the foundational philosophy that we have when we manage our clients money's 'cause we are financial advisors as I mentioned\nAnd one of the functions that we perform for our clients as we manage their money for them and what we tell them is you know that uh we're going to take care of we're going to manage your money for your job is to go and take a cruise okay we love you but get outta here [laughter]\nSee you later take off go go be be gone\nAnd we want you to not even think about your finances we want you to enjoy and we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nYou and I love you back and so you know we want our clients to be out there having fun and enjoying whatever they think of as their best retirement okay so we want that for you\nAnd so one of the things that we believe or to make that happen is very important is to protect the nest egg to protect the money the investments that you have built up over all the years that you were saving and and all that so that you could retire\nAnd you know as I mentioned earlier in the show and we've talked about it cash flow\nIs the primary thing that we look at when it comes to your retirement meaning that we want to make sure that to the extent that we can that the income you have coming in is going to be more than the expenses you have going out and we want that to be the case for the rest of your life\nOkay so if we can do that then you've had a successful retirement we've covered your cost of living we you've been able to go out and enjoy your second childhood and ah all this well\nNow cash flow is a function of\nThe amount of money you have to generate that income to generate that cash flow right so the more money you have the more cash flow you can generate the less money you have the less cash flow you can generate that that makes sense okay so therefore if a bear market comes\nAnd you lose thirty forty or fifty percent of your money like many people did Y. two K. and in two thousand eight then what could happen is that your cash flow could be cut in half right or by whatever amount that your investments dropped and\nIf that was [noise]\nIt would be a big bummer no kidding and\nIf that were to happen to you then what would that do would you be able to cut back like that okay because if you can't cut back if your if your expenses are fixed\nAnd your ability to cash flow those expenses is a you know hurt by a bear market then you're going to be spending more than your investments can generate which means that ...\nIs that you're doing with farmers called eating your seed corn and if you do enough of that than when groceries incomes guess what you'll have nothing left to plant now\nWe believed therefore you should buy you should hold and you should sell and we have a strategy that we employ that uh helps us with that and I in November of two thousand seven we told our clients and everybody listening to the show to sell them to get out and to stay out until June of two thousand nine so almost a year and a half\nAnd this is because our cell strategy told us to do that so those of you that followed that advice we're out of the stock markets are in two thousand and eight\nWhen the market went down to fifty seven percent during that period and our strategy is not perfect okay we we also it does predict Barry markets that don't happen\nA notably two thousand Fifteen when the China market collapse and all that it looked like a bear market was coming our strategy said to sell and we did and it turned out it was not a very market okay so I don't want to get anybody of false impression that we have a perfect strategy\nBut it is designed to help us to avoid major catastrophic losses\nNow what the by holders might say is hey you're a long term investor don't worry about it don't ever sell anything just stay in\nWell you know there's there's an expression and I've a it's a scary to me right now who said it but the market has the ability to stay irrational longer than you have the ability to stay solvent [laughter] okay so it can keep going down you could buy hold your way all the way down and you have out of money or by the time it decides to turn back around\nAnd you know there are there have been better markets that the market for example the great depression where it didn't recover for what twenty five years okay so it takes a while the Japanese market still hasn't recovered but I Want to look back at what happened last week and put it in perspective did you see how quickly the market turned did you see how fast\nIt went down and how much it went down in such a short period\nThe market can do that and that's why I Believe that if you are retired are retiring soon you should have a plan to address that because what if it keeps going what if this is the beginning of the big bad bear\nYou know how much did you lose last week take that multiplied by ten that's what I Would have been a two thousand they for example could you afford that and what would that do to your ability to stay retired if you are what would it do to your ability to retire if you're not retired yet you're about to\nThink about those kinds of things and ask yourself can afford that if you can't which I think almost everybody listen to show cannot then I think you fall into the Capitol people that agree with our philosophy which is you should have the by yes I'll hold yes but also a sell strategy\nAnd so you can learn more about it by going to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd while you're there you can sign up for one of our seminars

Facebook and he might be wondering like what is going on I'm getting all these messages from people that are saying that you know that I sent out an duplicate friend requested in what's going on is a true is it a hoax well are we talking about that in just a few moments but first the phone lines are open love to hear ...\nThat's one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us when you're calling in well there's Andrew but then ski and they Kevin commandos shown that Kim Andrew\n... in Tallahassee, Florida okay she me first up and she just she doesn't have a ... question but I Do want to inform you or she has no power right now\nAnd she has no water right now because she was in a hurricane Michael oh well yeah they've been out of power to run the generator they've been out of power some about Wednesday and now they have a social service\nBut she thinks she thinks there's some trick ratio either turn it off and turn it on and turning it off and turn it on so they're limiting the amount of people\nAll I mean you've seen the ... has been an aging steadily say I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though during when you start looking at the idea that storm and where it hit how ...\nClose it hit it could have had to like a major metropolitan\nArea and it wasn't just twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this is a huge hurricane\nYeah my brother lives near Panama City\nAnd how's he doing right okay or his house survived good ah but we're all\nYou know thinking I kept telling him like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you tell them to evacuate only two days beforehand and he did them morning of the hurricane yeah Russian government aren't we yes um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so ... was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about this though so if your house is twelve feet off the\nGround right every time that you pull into your driveway you're getting your stepson\nIs true of me just make sure you're wearing your predominant [laughter]\nBecause you're going up and up and down a best is in Tallahassee as Andrew said hello there Beth\nHi Pam so do you have Internet access is everything good by you we do not have Internet ah we have body cell service\nWas off All right so without the Internet what do you miss the most\nOh my gosh I'm probably social media\nFacebook it out I heard Facebook in the back right after fake I my daughter and my husband are here with me there are so um yeah I I I went to make a dinner for the last night and I thought oh I've got the rest he had said oh wait I Can't look it up [laughter]\nSorry can't run up the Mac and cheese again because I can read the Bible says okay\nAll right and then or cooking everything on the grill it that that's really interesting to well you know that it's healthy right or you know kind of kind of we just got a great that died out the window [laughter] oh during the hurricane\nAll I did was eat it was like I had the nerve is Monti\n[laughter] that's okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our first goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nUp the coast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speakers once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody getting them saying that everyone should have and I'm like do I really need one and what would I use it for\nYou know it's a really good question because it's one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic's going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and then you start moving up the actual long so then you say turn on the light\nAnd you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will lock the lights will go into night mode and then suddenly on
