Steve how are you I'm doing great well let's go over the suspects behavior how sloppy is describing his van had a bunch of stickers about how he loves Trump and and hates you know anyone who's a liberal or there might be saliva on the stamp\nOf one of the one of the bombs he sent through the mail is fingerprint was found he was tracked by a cell phone his show media imprint troubled every Democrat you can imagine and celebrity sloppy is this guy want it\nHe was tracked by a cell phone his show media imprint I mean his troubled every Democrat you can imagine in celebrity how sloppy is this guy want to do\nWell I think what it what it indicates that there could be some of that but I think what it indicates is that he really didn't care about being caught in from from what we're seeing with reports it it's almost like he knew he was going to get caught so when you have somebody who is willing to commit a crime committed an act of violence\nAnd they they don't care about being found are caught they're ... they're not even you know try to hide it that's incredibly dangerous I mean that's a really dangerous person that's that's like a suicide bomber you know they're they're prepared to die\nAnd going into a you know a restaurant or a or wherever where there's a crowd and and blow themselves up and kill a bunch of people along with them so\nThat that's one of the worst criminals you know that that you have to deal with because you know they they don't care about their own life\nAnd that's that's a big problem and that might be what what we had here this guy didn't care about you know what his position than ideology word that people would would see that this this is a coup potentially and that you know I mean he's got those ideologies and and you know as well as he's sending out these packages so\nUm that's probably what's what's happening you you probably didn't care\n... Steve we know that he's been charged with Thirteen the or the FBI was saying hey look these were not a did these could have been deadly these were not a fake they were not something that was you know and not supposed to go off they had real\nI don't know what the exact term is but these were bombs that were clearly made to go off fortunately they did not\nWhy hasn't this guy been charged with domestic terrorism that's what we don't understand he's under five counts but nothing about domestic terrorism\nWe will we don't know if he's going to be charged with domestic terrorism yet of right now\nWouldn't that be the first charge I mean my goodness what was he trying to do run a bomb a former Bronx area go all of a president\n... ... exactly ... ... that that's part of the investigation they depending on if he if he cooperates it gives an interview depending on what they find on his social media what they find on his phone to her as my advice is\nTalking yet Warren is bad and so on if if they can prove\nThat he was doing this for some kind of political agenda or to influence our political system or something like that\nNow you're falling into the area of domestic terrorism some type of domestic terrorists terrorism charge right now they're just going to charge them with whatever they can just hold them on you know whoa hold them in the system\nAnd then when they do an indictment or or a superseding indictment then they're going to be adding more charges into those indictments as they gather more evidence to be able to prove those charges\nOkay so ... I'm I'm not really following you how to how would he not get a domestic terrorism charge if he if he just did it because he didn't like how do you prove if he sent all these bombs to all Democrats all people who've criticized or don't like Donald Trump how do you how would he not be charged with domestic terrorism I don't get that\n... they may not have the evidence to meet the elements of that crime yet oh I'm In right now\nRight we've got right now we've got a fingerprint we got DNA on these devices or ... well on these packages and or devices I mean so unclear which which are where it's coming from but he's attached to those packages and devices so right there you have him\nWith with a good evidence that ties into those charged with regards to those devices explosive material\nSo so those are those automatic charge that's typically what we do in these federal investigations especially big ones you're going to charge him with whatever you have that that is right in front of you which which in this case\nAnd Frank rigs Kathy is the Democratic a choice and Frank is the Republican choice thank you both for showing up today at the same time going to be higher than\nThe only people that talk smack or ... shouted anyway that's real good that is true\nSo it's mostly to each other right so so so let's start with something that a lot of teachers reached out to us about and it is the class size I bet teachers country and say gay does you know what that ten percent raise is good I like it but my classes my class size is bigger\nSo now I'm making a little bit more money but I'm working harder so let's start with the Democrat Kathy Hoffman\nHow are you going to fix class sizes and then what Frank rigs or get last word on that\nThe root of the issue when we're talking about class size and the growing class size is is that we have a teacher shortage here in Arizona with less teachers in Arizona with over Fifteen hundred teaching vacancies that's why we have such large class sizes because we need qualified teachers in the classroom to manage the classrooms and\nHundred teaching vacancies that's why we have such large class sizes because we need qualified teachers in the classroom to manage that classrooms\nAnd of course with the larger class sizes we see greater workload which results and greater turnover of teachers I pour retention of our teachers teachers are leaving the profession are leaving the state\nAnd so the way to solve this issue of class size at the root of it is to get it how can we make the teaching profession more attractive silver upbringing and people are passionate about ... about teaching who want to stick with it\nAnd and ... and hair counselors and social workers have support staff instructional aides in the classroom to support our teacher said that they want to stay in the schools\nVery Frank rigs the Republican how to fix the the class size\nProblem that we have here in Arizona [noise] well one way is to encourage more pure professionals in the classroom or teacher interns ... because that's that's a good setting I mean obviously for a aspiring teacher to get on the job training and we both visited a charter school yesterday great arts academy in Maryville\nWhere we saw that in practice we solve teacher in turns in the classroom can you to find that a little bit more ... what about if you get your interest or intern is someone who is pursuing an undergraduate degree and ultimate credentialing\nIn primary or secondary education and they're getting the opportunity to practice what what they've learned in the classroom but more broadly speaking I agree that that we obviously have an acute well documented teacher shortage I've talked about it before when you gave me the opportunity to join you and what I Want to do is benchmark educator compensation\nThat is to say the compensation of our school leaders are classroom teachers in our school support personnel\nBoth or pay and benefits to their counterparts in the southwestern mountain west regions because we know we have to be competitive\nWith those neighboring states we want to recruit between the best teachers for Arizona students and secondly we have to vow\nTo never allow the base level of funding for K. twelve education per pupil funding to fall below the rate of student in Rome and growth and inflation if it does that would trigger one of two things either a moratorium on any further tax cuts\nOr a potentially a tax increase because again we have to maintain that as a as our minimum for funding levels\nSo so what's the ideal number of students in one class\nWell and that's just set a cap on that but unfortunately it's not a problem that we can address without addressing the teacher's heart if you don't have a teacher\nWho are they going to be with and coming back to the ship pair professionals\nUm I Know the professionals I worked with and the furious school district\nOne of them had been with the district for Seventeen years and she was only making a dollar more than minimum wage at eleven dollars and Seventy cents and our power professionals are often working with our students with disabilities\nOne of those students with someone with a developmental disability who wheelchair bound had a vision impairments she needed a lot of therapies and support and that ... it's almost like a nurse at requires that high level of training to be meeting their medical needs in the classroom making making sure they can navigate the schools\nAnd to be only paid for that person eleven

finances so um first of all\nIf you haven't noticed the stock market the Dow the S. and P. have been on a decidedly downward path shall I say I'm over the last what six weeks now\nUh so many of you

your host can re\n[noise]\nThank you Jack and this is the bonanza the airwaves we share with you the golden gets of the natural information and uh every week and I\nYou're faithful host can rewrite had been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we are a for money matters that special we we specialize in a retirement planning so we work with people primarily or over fifty retired are retiring soon and if that is you we want to work with you as well and the show is designed for you\nAnd I recently barons of Barron's Magazine named Anwar you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors for the seven year in a row yeah wow is right I'm very impressed by that but you know what\nWithout our clients we would be absolutely nowhere so I I give it to them I don't I don't take any credit for that\nNow since we are a firm that does that that specializes in a retirement planning [noise] um we we all this you know\nIt's a different philosophy\nBeing a financial advisor to somebody who is about to retire or is already retired than it is if you are talking to somebody who's in their twenties or thirties\nIs this different when you're in your twenties and thirties you're on a fence you're growing your money you're being aggressive you know you can be more aggressive you've got more time I'm chances are you're not going to be living on that money for a long time so you don't have to take into account withdrawals from the from your money so you can be more aggressive you can take a little bit more risk\nAnd in the long run if should pay off for you but\nThat isn't the case once you get\nFive years of retirement or five years after retirement in my opinion I think at that point\nYou have to start thinking about preserving and keeping what you have and so I think there is no doubt and so risk number eight of the uh Eighteen risks that are the important risks that you face during retirement is market risk and this last a\nCouple of weeks has really been an example of why that is such an important thing so\nHere's this study by Wade power that show the impact of market risk on retirement income planning\nAnd you know when we visit with clients and what we talk about primarily is we want to get you the income that you need you know to support the lifestyle you are going to have during your retirement\nSo you know Social Security comes into play in that if you have real estate if you have a annuities all those kinds of things but anyway they looked at a hundred and fifty one hypothetical portfolios each earning market returns with the only difference being the thirty years that was measured\nAnd the amount of money that was accumulated for retirement varied a lot\nAnd the average accumulation was ten times salary or during these are the thirty years prior to retirement but outcomes ranged from three to twenty seven times salary depending on which thirty year period that was tested so it means when you start is really important\nNow the impact of this a specific rates of return in the final years of accumulation when the value was the highest had the most impact on the ending value meaning that in the last years of your retired before you retired those last years are the most impactful on how much money you're going to have when you are\nSo if your retired before you retired those last years are the most impactful on how much money you're going to have when you are now going to retire now\nThe other thing that they looked at is taking those same portfolios that those those hundred and fifty one portfolios\nLooking forward now gay so now you're retired and you look the next Thirty years the forward and using a constant inflation adjusted withdrawal strategy or he also found that the actual maximum sustainable withdrawal rates over thirty or periods ranged from one point nine percent to are you ready ten point nine percent\nAnd the sustainable withdrawal rates are disproportionally explained by the returns in the early part of your retirement\nSo the five years before you retire the five years after you retire or the most important according to study and I agree with that I've seen it in in with our clients it is the most important ten year period of your entire financial life\nBecause it's the most impactful five years before on whether you're going to be able to retire and five years after whether you can stay retired\nThough [laughter] even do market risk create some uncertainty other research shows that retirees may not be able to afford not to take some market wrists you got you have to take some risk because if you don't you can't you won't keep up with inflation so there's some risk you have to take\nAnd uh so one thing that ... a research does show again ...\nAre increasing your exposure to stocks not hiding everything away from stocks does improve\nYour portfolio sustainability and the ending wealth amount that you'll have after certain life expectancy periods and again to address inflation so what is one of the things that they don't talk about in that study is what we do which is to have a cell strategy\nAnd so you know you look at one point nine percent basically let's call it a two percent withdrawal rate why is that well because during that period where there was a where there were a lot of beer markets during that period\nAnd so if you were taking out a higher rate what would happen is you'd run out of money and so do you have to bring it down for that those particular periods now with our cell strategy we've looked at it also we have a high degree of confidence that our clients can take out more than one point nine percent and not\nRun out of money but of course one of the important things about financial planning is that it's not cast in stone right you start you go and then you start looking at what's happening and you adjust accordingly you know I like to equate it to an arrow and he'd guided missile\nSo an arrow a bow and arrow a is all the intelligence that this is going to have is at the point of release ride you're aiming you're taking into account when you're taking account all the stuff that's going on and you aim at you release\nAnd that era that's all the information is ever going to have and if the wind picks up the target moves you know something happens it's going to miss\nNow a heat guided missile on the other hand it's constantly adjusting and its tracking the heat of its target and it's following it wherever it goes\nSo that's what financial planning in my opinion is it's a heat guided missile that you are searching you you're constantly keeping your eye on making sure that your client never runs out of money that's the goal that's the target and you adjust accordingly as you go\nA and I'm going to talk about later on in the show if if you had a preference of when you would have to lose money would it be earlier later and we'll talk about I'll give you some more specifics on that so if you're retired or retiring soon\nThen one of the things you should be thinking about uh with some anxiety\nAh is what's been going on over the last few weeks you know this market is shaping itself up and it looks like we may be on the verge of a of a bear market despite the good news and you know the thing about their markets as they come when nobody expects them I mean if if if you think about every very market that's happened\nThe vast majority of people did not expect it you know if everybody expected it probably wouldn't happen right\nSo therefore it's important that you prepare for it\nSo what I Want you to do is go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were

they should be right hardest known substance is not right but you know what I think that a financial planning ideas that help you achieve your goals or even better than that because\nIf you do it right I think it's possible that you could buy yourself a few diamonds here and there anyway we are back I Am can write the host of money matters with Ken rape and I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty\nMarvelous wonderful and very exciting years at all the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients and that we are affirmed that specializes in retirement planning so we primarily worked with people that are over the age of fifty who I retired or who are retiring soon\n[noise] and do we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states and we are honored and blessed by that and Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisers and this is now for the second time [noise]\n\nAnd uh you know thank you for that a little Tempe there but you know what without ... without our clients we would be no are so clients listening right now and those of you who are not listening we we adore our clients and that we are so grateful and in fact you know I Want to share it with you something and and when asked you ladies and gentlemen I'm\nOver ... since October the AIDS\nYou know you may have noticed that uh the market has been very volatile in fact I'm that first week October the ... the ... the Dow went down Thirteen hundred points that we remember the eight hundred point drop day\nAnd then followed up with more and more and we it's been down pretty much every week since then and us over the last three weeks the market has gone down quite a bit and my question to you would be\nHow much communication have you gotten from your financial advisor\nOkay because I think when times are rough when it's getting scary out there I think that's when we are in our keep you know we have two goals for our clients one is for them to have financial peace of mind\nAnd peace of mind I Believe comes from communication if you know what's going on and you have confidence in what's going on then you have peace of mind in my opinion and so\nSince October the ...\nWe have sent three videos which I produced and uh and we sent your clients to talk about what we thought was going on and what we are going to do about it and all of that\nWith a purpose in mind for them to have a direct contact with us\nBy a video where they can have peace of mind where we can set their mind at ease the were on top of it and we're watching things and they don't have to worry about it okay I don't know if it works I think it did but hopefully it did a but also uh we've had three emails as well I think it may actually be for\nA where we talk about conditions situations are portfolios and all that kind of stuff\nWith our clients so over the last three weeks we've had six and I actually think it's seven\nI'm just reading from my notes here but I think it's seven communications with our clients\nThe last three weeks we've had six and I actually think it's seven\nAnd just reading from my notes here but I think it's seven communications with our clients regarding the volatility in the market\nAnd again it's because our goal is to give our clients peace of mind and our second goal is for their money to last as long as they do that that's also important that peace of mind is important too\nSo I Would ask you do you get that same sort of thing if you don't then maybe you should consider making a change I don't know uh and you can go to our website if you want to learn more about us it's money matters dot net\nAnd when you're there you can look through and see what you think in the click on meat with an advisor if you'd like to do that but let me ask you a question now because we are as we we primarily work with retirees and people who are are going to retire soon\nWe are defensively minded when it comes to how we manage your money for you okay so what I mean by that is that we believe that you have to preserve your principal to be able to provide you with the income to enjoy all the things that you want to do during your retirement\nAnd we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want you to go play and have fun and whatever that looked like do you want you to enjoy it to the hilt\nBut you know what if you lose half your money in a bear market it's going to be very difficult to do that right you could lose the ability to do it\nSo let me ask you a question the average bear market according to net Davis research is a loss on the U.S and pay thirty seven percent thirty seven percent of the average\nNow back in two thousand eight and went down to fifty seven percent in two thousand it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than normal the ... an average the average is thirty seven so the question I Would ask you is this\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nIf you had to obviously prefer not to but if you had to lose it [laughter] that's not an option here you're gonna lose thirty seven percent okay so when would you rather do it when you're sixty or when you're Seventy five\nNow interestingly I've asked them quite a few people that question and the answer they've given me is I Would rather have it happen you know when I'm when I'm uh sixty because if I lose it when I'm sixty I have time to recover it you know got time\nAh but that's actually wrong\nUh we've done studies where if you lost thirty seven percent and you've taken inflation adjusted four percent out of your money\nAnd you assume and ... percent return on the market what would happen if you started when you're sixty and you lost a big chunk right off the bat you'd actually run out of money by the time you were eighty however if you ... if you lost that same amount when you were Seventy five then it would take a while before your money runs out in the last\nStep into your nineties and therefore guess what you probably won't run out of money so the answer is you want the farther out you can put losing that money if you have to lose the farther out you you push the better the earlier you ... it happens the worst\nAnd we talked about that in our in our second segment of uh with the research on ... you know how market risk and affect your retirement\nSo the the big point of that conversation I just had is\nThat the five years before you retire and the five years after you retire we consider that ten year period to be the most important period of your entire financial life okay because\nNo matter how much you money you've accumulated over the course of your lifetime you spent Thirty years doing it if you lose fifty seven percent of it in the year before you retire that's going to hurt your of resistance ... very persistent\nNow the other side of it is that if you retire\nAnd within that five years you lose fifty seven percent like happened and why and then two thousand eight or even thirty seven percent which is the average then that also could significantly cause you to have financial difficulties and not to be able to enjoy your second childhood without parental supervision\nSo we believe that protecting your principal having a by holding cell strategy is very important\nAnd that's why our strategy told us to to sell to get our clients out of the stock market to tell her clients to be out in in November of two thousand seven and to stay out during the entire craft of two thousand eight so here's what I Want you to go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd sign up for one of our seminars or or visit with one of our advisors or watch videos listened the podcast read articles all those kinds
