have put cabin on the Supreme Court only for one reason one reason only and I've said this for a couple of weeks now\nThe only reason I wouldn't put cabin on the Supreme Court is because of what he said when he testified he said it was a Clinton hit job he he went after all the Democrats and you know what the Democrats deserved it\nBut my point is he can't be fair now and Jeff Flake doesn't care
