[noise] ah we have twenty five gigabytes of data and we used it came in like four hours\nAnd then and we go down to the bottom and slow extremely slow pace of flower or ours wow\nYeah because I have two teenage boy you're updating their [laughter] video game or X. box and and what not and\nThen my husband and I like to look at things on the Internet and that and I have another one that has an eye pad and he likes to get games and it's just to the point where I was just I'm frustrated so I was wondering is a weed boost for the home it's a cell phone signal booster that I've looked\nAt and you plug it into one of the house and plug it into the other end of the house and I was just wondering if something like that would work for us\n[noise] no [noise] no [noise] um\nIt's all it's doing at that point is it's boosting the signal okay\nAnd so it's amplifying the signal so the whole idea is that if you don't have decent cellular coverage is that you can buy this booster and then instead of having like three bars you might have for bars okay ooh ah and it does it by amplifying the connection with than a certain area around you okay\nAh 'cause I'm so that's not gonna help you um I assume that you this is the only option\n[noise] well I'm that's why I'm calling you because it it's to the point where we've gone over to a friend's house the Internet to uh teach\nWhat you do what she 'cause you know it's you know you can get fifty gigs but if you're blowing through fifth you know Fifteen gigs in four hours I mean what's the sense right I mean you're right there's a\nThere's always satellite\nAnd yeah we try well we've heard our neighbors to gripe about it\nYeah if you don't want specially when you're looking at games and you've got three guys in the house that are trying to do games that's not going to work or doesn't work very well it also crawls um have you looked into a DSL line\nAnd that comes from a company correct because we've called our uh TV company and that is\nIs that those Bactrim\nYes okay back them an charter and nobody will come down our road and it follows them since two thousand for\nUm [noise] I just for giggles okay let me tell you let me tell you a couple of things from Kaye\nIs a a friend of mine recently purchased a home in North of this probably isn't going to be the day but north of Scottsdale, Arizona okay [noise]\nAnd so you have Phoenix you have Scottsdale and then you have like this stretch of road where there's nothing okay miles around\nAnd and she bought this beautiful house in the middle of five acres okay All right it's in the house has like a thousand square feet but she likes to ... she has no neighbors right right\nNow she's also a doctor on call [noise] and so before so she has a house in escrow and she's totally calls me she freaks out case\nOn called [noise]\nAnd so before so she has a house in escrow and she's totally calls me she freaks out she's like\nOh my God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet\nAnd we I have the house in escrow\nSo I told her just to uh I I did some homework for her and I found a a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her\nWho who has a line and has set up a point to point Internet access service with some of his neighbors\nOkay ... and\nShe pays fifty dollars a month and she said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and now she was worried about that Brent [noise]\nBut but still she is able to get to to fight in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be just look at him in real time right mhm\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I see if there were any options in in a if you just Google your ZIP Code with point to point that's what it's called ... or sometimes it's called fixed point wireless\nAnd basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight\nOkay so is there a lot of mountains and a lot of mountains around you know OK okay so\nSo if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains that it doesn't work\nBut years ago as I I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there were at the cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a fixed point wireless lined put in on the roof\nThat I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty miles by the bird flies okay for a while so I Would look around to see if there's any type of six point wireless I Would also call wins train in your area\nOr to see if they have any options for you as well\nYou know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster a cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there\n... and then I started playing you're now you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs and uh\nSo you know and then and then of course you're gonna have to tell the kids that you know there was a time not too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\n[laughter] and it's no with no shoes exactly [laughter] so they're just going to have to go to the library [laughter] hey we've been there at all out you mean [laughter] we've tried hat [laughter] I could just\nSee you're you're

computer section at AOL years and years and years ago do you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disk and the cereal box you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes is that and I ... I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says that we'll find out Tuesday [laughter] is that with AOL is that if you gave a desk\nSometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person is that is that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow\nI mean when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a\nWhile I mean this is like in the early

[laughter] no I was I Would put him in like because I have\nThe computer tutor videotapes oh okay I put 'em in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign him do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened\nIs that so you know so I'm like I started the computers actually got this whole AOL thing going on\nOkay and then they changed managers at the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten an assault numbers I've gotten like a check for twenty five grand for a month just by people using the disk you hand it that it was a disc and then taken using the computer section okay that I that I managed and this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us that's a bit different than a different character I said well that's not going to really work for me [laughter] okay\nAnd so that was when using key word commando instead of going to AOL that I mean we negotiate I negotiate that it would go to ... dot com that's when you watch the website but that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson\nIs not to depend upon a company\nFor the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one last one can you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] what was that anyway [laughter] yeah one on

Boston Red Sox and all that's going on in the world series David Allan Lambert he's the chief genealogist and the New England historically the logical society and American ancestors dot org how are you sir\nAll for Red Sox nation we are doing really good and um tonight is to be home for a couple\nOf weeks before I head out to Salt Lake city for doing some research with any it shifts and our tour I just got back from the British Institute and I'll tell you it was a wonderful week of twenty classes intensive on English genealogy and I could go next year and do Irish Scottish oil wells which are the other three components so\nThe British Institute for genealogy well worth doing\nSharpening your acts which is what good genealogist always do\nThe sixty minutes on Sunday in the ... good friends he seemed more command performance they're talking about what went on behind finding that killer in Washington state that was a great episode\nAnd testing Steve Croft interviewing her and she was showing everybody exactly\nHow she saw this case and works to solve other cases as well and she's got a bunch more in the pipeline and I'm hoping the FCC on the show here real soon so we can get caught up with her because it's been a few months so we will do that All right onto our family he's to our news for this week David where do we begin\nWell I'll tell you I think the story it really needs to start with Lisa Jensen who thought she was abandoned by her abusive father in Nineteen eighty six when she was left at five years old left behind a fake name of the fingerprint well sixteen years later than Manuel band Alisa was actually a restaurant in charge\nJust tired and I decided to take a step back and kind of reevaluate what I wanted to do next and I realized the one thing I couldn't live without what storytelling I Love to tell stories and it just so happened that right before I made that decision I was at a dinner party in California\nOr their leadership subtle and a woman said you know she's talking I overheard ... storytelling festival and I thought what ... myself and went over and I said look I wasn't nice wrapping her two words storytelling\nEthical said the kids these kids I work with jokingly call him and his story lady so is this festival for kids and she said no it's in the bay area San Francisco I don't think it's an action anymore I think it's the phone I could\nBe wrong though and she said about a thousand adults calm and people tell stories professional story tellers and I was like I'm going with it and\nShe asked me where I live and I told her and she told me about the national stereotyping festival she's like that's the mother ship go and I did in my life was changed I can still remember standing on the street with my backpack and in between tents says about six answers about\nFifteen hundred in each ten and I remember standing there thinking this is it\nYour phone thing you've ... right\nMhm and I vowed to myself that in two years I'd be on that stage [laughter]\nAh yes innocence and [laughter]\nI mean everyone's like you can't you have to do this this this because we all know you got to do this with us and I like that you tell me that I can only do something along the way I Will make short preview there's another way to secure the four and a little bit easier and faster so I did I work\nMy tail off I mean like a young group of guys in a band drive and I would tell anywhere for any amount of money to anybody or worked all my craft and I wrote and I traveled and sometimes I worked for gas money sometimes I Would take tickets and tear on chairs if I could open for a certain storyteller\nAnd a lot of sensible directors were surprised I was willing to do all of that\nYou you lose you pay ... yes you did and that's what this is what people need to understand is the story telling Kraft really use a craft that and I know it's very insulting to some to call these tellers\nComedians because it's it's it is there are similarities to stand up but it's very different from bad it's long form\nIt's a lot of detail and I love the fact that you can really take your time with it [noise]\nYeah and you know what there's a big difference to my friend and the opposite where when he was the difference between comedy and what we do a ... class storyteller that you fall in love with other people or characters\nAnd Schumer is clash storytellers is that you fall in love with other people or characters Jesse fault\nSometimes they die and sometimes things don't end well but you know in my piece is and I am long for him but I Do I have a twenty minute pieces you know but I purposely used the funny very intentional and four months can find\n[laughter] well it is the love you'd get first of all you're just one of the most time when people I've I've ever seen under these stages in in a while you're describing starting rather be starting from the beginning you've always had that gift and there is a gifted there is challenge involved\nBut what I Want to do is spend part of this segment with you and the next one is talking about how other people can develop some of these skills what it takes because I think people going to reunions and having the ability to share stories about grandma and grandpa has got to be one of the great gifts that you can share with descendants\nLike [noise] you know if they're really serious about carrying these stories on to take a little time and try and homeless skills as valuable because the younger generation the tension held and we also have to remember that just because I'm a mom and I'm a grandmother\nAnd even though I Know all those stories of my parents and grandparents just because of oiling around my head and watch a lot we dropped the line or two\nDoes not mean that the children and grandchildren to them and I think sometimes people would sit down with their children and grandchildren and start asking like shocked at what we don't know something is very basic as\nYou know how grandma and grandpa meant\nYeah you know and I walk a little a book that are going to actually have a whole lot of interesting ideas as well as insight as to how to make the passing on of the genealogy the stories of either genealogy to\nFuture generations how to do it in a way that is fun and inclusive of all of us getting involved\nAnd I'm really excited about that it's going to work and uh I Love this kind of stuff\nAs you analyze your ability to put the story together because obviously you create a lot of material not every story goes linear really and it works out and such a way that things come back around in it for you to understand the significance of what just happened that type of thing\nHow do you analyze the story and tied those threads that keep coming back around and make them so interesting\n[laughter] well it's a complex story Our shop Scott yeah [laughter]\nOkay let's take it down to the streets my basic [noise] you have to have\nThe people which obviously in genealogy we do it that's what we want to focus on right now we're not talking section and then there's the place so you've you research data caught but the bones no clean accounting I caught the accounting of genealogy but the people the places the bait\nBut it's the problems and the progress that make up stories to say\nOkay that's the part that makes it really goes yesterday I had\nThe ... the luxury of it was more than an on it was a luxury to present the BYU law students afterwards we had a lunch between the professors and the people that are raised that on the conversation just with how that is talking about\nThe things we found out about our family it's allowed their genealogy\nOr their do lack of interest stories and problem and progressive\nAnd the local feet or what could build a great story a round of counting part of genealogy some obviously the people you have the place you have the problem yet the progress\nAnd so whenever you take a certain caution with history out of the family with all that down to one unique personal if possible try and go round dots\nAnd research of fond of draw what what are they eating in that region during a pond rise up you really want to turn it into a story on something that your family repeat over and over those little details added to\nThe arc of the story on them the people in the place all the time can really fluff fill out I'll tell you who's a real mouse starts out as as a gentleman named climate Romney\nAnd he's so good at it showing stories\nOf his ancestors and even though the ancestors within different counties them out in a real period field to the story in quitting and information that may not be genealogy records but it's common knowledge about them so successful that place really solid\nAnd are those are some simple\nSimple things to do well and I think a lot of\nNot really follow the law the Hubble sure\n... do well and I think a lot of really good genealogist understand creating a timeline around your ancestor not only of their dates their birth marriage deaths\nAnd places but also what's going on historically within their region their area within the country maybe even within the world because a lot of those things really inform what happened to that person throughout the course of their life\nAnd also ... ... or supplies are down on their own\nRight boy there's so much\nLike all of a little clarity which allows you to lay out the story like more and cultural foreign more understandable circle\nI'm Talking to Kim white camp she's a storyteller with storytelling festivals throughout the country and acumen we come back I Want to get an idea of\nHow much exaggeration you allow yourself when it comes to bowling family stories and why when we return coming up in five minutes on extreme genes America's family history show [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nDid you know the heart disease

our preservation ... we've been talking a lot off air here recently and I I thought you know it would really be fun to share with you\nSome of the stories from the store you know Tom has been doing this did you ... and helping people preserved their materials for for decades on and\nAnd so I asked him well what are the stories from the store what's happening behind the counter with Tom Perry and Tom some of these stories you've come up with her absolutely incredible\nOh it's amazing for instance we were playing some of the old Andy bombers ... you may\nNot stop out who that is now that's criminal Gail Halvorson we've actually had him on the show and he's the guy that drop little parachutes with candy bars to those people trapped in Berlin right after World War two he's still around he's Ninety eight years old and you did his ditches as a nation of his own movies from that era right\nBack oh man it's probably been about Twenty years ago he brought in it all down that was it ... and we try and sort of for him and it's just show called sea and these kids up against the fans and hadn't gone to a devil that'll parachutes and all these kinds of things\nAnd we try and sort of for him and it's just so cool seeing these kids up against the phantom handing gum to um devil that'll parachutes and all these kinds of things\nAnd later planned a DVD in the stores jak back before Blu ray was even big and they had a guy that was just captivated by it so he said oh yeah this is candy bombers movies he shot while he was over there and it was just really enthralled in it\nAnd said that's my grandfather and I go through your mind boggling pointed to one of the guys and they're building the little pair of shoes to go on the candy and it was just absolutely incredible he had never ever seen this before\nSo he was totally dumbfounded that his grandfather was asking the same squadron and he thought this was just absolutely so cool to react you saw this video\nIsn't that amazing well that's fun stuff and then you had this thing about the aunt in the park story and this blew my mind\nOh this was absolutely crazy we had a gentleman in the store to pick up his home movies that was from his mother and Diane was helping him and he gave his name et cetera and this other lady that was in the store dropping off some fail said are you related to so and so and he goes well yeah that's my mother\nAnd she goes well my mother was showing show and he goes well yeah I've heard my mother mentioned her name and then she said they were best friends back in the day and high school and said that they remember being in the twenty fourth of July parade and he goes well yeah that's what I just had transferred with a dish that we had of that she goes you're kidding me\nThat's what I just brought in to can I get a copy of yours and he says can I have a copy of your show just happened to me in a store in the same time it is such a small world\nWith the same footage basically from two different cameras from from how far back mid sixties I think you were saying\nRight believe there was like fifty to sixty three the myth sixty that they were in this big parade and they were both in at a high school and younger kids and they had several years on this footage and now they were going to be able to share with each other\nThat's amazing at both moms are in it I mean that's insane\nOh exactly you know it's such a small world this is why I really recommend people when they get their films transfer they put at least snippets of it up on like Facebook are online someplace on YouTube because you never know who's going to watch your video saying hey yeah I was in this parade this year ... he had to watch the whole thing\nAnd maybe they were in the background or maybe you just happen\nTo shooting Airflow going by and they have no video of it so it showed need to be able to have this kind of step to share it with people around the globe\nYou know you remind me of a story of a neighbor who told me about her dad playing on a college football team and then he was in a big bowl game back in Nineteen thirty nine just before the war broke out\nAnd before he went off to serve in the war\nAnd I went on to you too and I found footage of that football game and we found pictures of her dad playing and of course she had his number\nSo she knew exactly who he was and it wasn't a lot of footage but it sure enough to make her happy Tom what's tell some more of these stories from the store when we return in just a few minutes because I Know you're loaded up with um are

is pretty strong we know that people are now\nNot underwater like they were a number of years ago but who is exactly buying houses if you're starting out you're a young person it's not good for you [noise] well I mean I Wonder if the deals are are are\nLike at the houses are too expensive houses are too expensive and they're going very quickly and inventory as well as people aren't making enough money to save and you also have the uh the the the huge impediment is college debt you have these people who want to start a life\nAnd he to save and you also have the uh the the the huge impediment is college debt you have these people who want to start a life where you're delaying marriage delaying having children because it's too expensive to buy a house because they're you know fifty grand a hundred grand in debt yeah but\nHere's the thing are you going to rent and just throw your money away or are you going to\nPurchase a house which is an investment but how do you get the house how do you get the down payment for the house you know when your child to pay rent right trying to pay off all the Jane Goodall learn to say you can still get alone if you owe student debt\nOr you're not that that you're going to be fine with that it just it it actually shows that you've been able to pay off certain other debt you know earlier in your life but you still need that down payment on which is pretty sizable when you're you know depends on how much you you you can put down right hands on how much you want to put down right\nBut yeah I mean you know the the inventory especially in the valley it seemed like houses just go immediately\nEspecially ones that are in established neighborhoods\nThat may be flipped or maybe re done\nWhile they'll go even before it it's on the market but we

you\nAre saying the president rejects anti Semitism in those attacks\nSo here's what we're talking about and big story one\nWe know what happened last week with the bombs in the mail we know what happened over the weekend with just horrific story of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting\nHave you heard on ABC News that they're already the funerals have started it's just so sad yeah\nSo there were a lot of people that are blaming President Trump mhm or his rhetoric at ... rhetoric excuse me is out of hand\nYou know sometimes it goes to rallies and he does call for violence um Trump today said it's not my fault it's the media's fault so Trump has blamed the media for the mail bombs and the synagogue shooting\nSo let's talk about it how much blame should Trump get how much blame should the media get I think\nAnd we talked about this a little bit earlier in the show a I think that it is way too easy to blame Donald Trump for everything that goes bad in the United states of America a lot of things happen here that are really bad\nAnd it seems like it's been bad you know with with school shootings mass shootings it's definitely gotten worse over the over the last few years but I think we've got to remember\nA there were so many school shootings under President Iraq Obama for most every other week he was not walk about was it his fault\nNo okay so what about President Trump All right well\nYou know mail bombs um the guy was a Trump fan he was a huge Trump supporter you saw his band I mean goodness the idea of Trump stickers all over it\nAnd I had a record since the since the Nineteen nineties yeah okay so I got to say as much as Trump drives me crazy with some of the things that he says\nI mean I don't think he's putting a gun in the hand of of the guy who went into the Pittsburgh synagogue and shot people I think it's just too easy to have an argument to say Trump's rhetoric says fault\nI don't feel like\nCertainly I don't feel like he's he's United anybody I think he's he's divided everybody but that doesn't mean mass shootings happen because of Donald Trump right I don't believe that right it but there is a disconnect because the press secretary will say you know America\nIs not about violence the president doesn't condones violence or ...\nBut there is a disconnect because the press secretary will say you know America is not about violence the president
