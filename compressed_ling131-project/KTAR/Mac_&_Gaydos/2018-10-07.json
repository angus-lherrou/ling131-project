I Wish the microphone was on and and so we're having before you started going knee deep in a gallon of tic tac\nWe're we're having a conversation about\nAbout expectations I'm you know for sellers and for buyers you know you know they're they're they're making a major major financial decision we as real estate professionals and we don't ever shy away from it we don't ever hide away from it but\nWe're pretty good money okay for what we do we make very very good money we feel like we bring value to it\nAnd but we are talking about how other people out there in the industry may maybe the same amount of money but they have rules like their phones are turned off at five o'clock at\nAnd and so as you say a different level of customer service and we were just talking as you're going back and forth about how especially your ... or the it's a big decision and and how we are there and how you're there for the clients all the time and I know so many of your listeners have already experienced that\nSo well I was just saying that I I feel like that's the number one ah feedback that I get from clients is that when they close at one of the reasons they're so happy as they they tell me\nThank you you're awesome I'll definitely refer you because you were there every time I needed something and so for me when I started selling real estate that was one decision that I made because there are a lot of people in this business that decides to not work weekends or\nAnd I understand you know the families though at five o'clock my phone goes off or whatever it may be\nIt's amazing I actually use them on my roof ah because my roof was damaged and they came out and just uh gave me an artist shake great pricing and they said they were going to show up and guess what they did a shock me these days they showed up [laughter]\nSo that's our friends at Mesa roofing they go all over the valley a and I put my stamp of approval upon them if you ah got some roof damage you want them to come take a look at it all you got to do is to use the word Mesa to for one one Ninety two three you know you're talking about about representation\nDon't buy a house with a representation a it also applies more importantly to new builds um I always maybe I'm a cynical hurt him I said look all person\nNo and I also very handsome but [laughter]\nI don't think it is it my turn to buy dinner [laughter]\nSo do I care for that but I haven't had another day long [laughter] but um well last year you were doodling muscle when you're when you're looking at it if I rented a Dodger that what it was I was about\nRepresentation and I'm and I don't think I'm a cynical person but a lot of times I'm always when I get in a situation of getting sold on something I'm like okay\nYou know what's in it for them and who's best interest to they truly have in mind and\nAnd what I I think one of the worst things that you can do is buy a new build\nWith out representation and when you walk into a new build with out your agent you're for fitting representation and now there are builders out there trying to talk people\nTo firing their agent and go with these I buy are programs out there okay why would they do that in who's best interest do they have in mind and when we help people we only have their best interest in my and I know you help but one of our listeners with a new bill before\nI did and real quick I was just going to say that reminded me because they are they're trying to push people to these programs but I actually recently had experience where one of the new bill agents\nOffered to have the client fires realtor and sell their house for free but he's not listening agents so he sits in a new build office and sells his product all day long but he was going to price their home out and sell it for free just so that they didn't bring an agent and to help them purchase their new built that was ...\nThis is why do they want you to buy from them without representation right\nExactly and we did well I I just we just called on a new build yesterday for one of our listeners and\nI I've done a lot of new bills representation especially on the east LA things are just really booming out in the ... area queen creek area and you know for one thing it cuts into their condition I mean that's the biggest thing is it does and then the other thing is there's a lot of relationships there I was just sort of build or I won't call them out by name\nBut as I was sitting there even with me they're representing my client they were trying to get them to use the homeowner's insurance company that's under their name that title company that's under the name\nNow that I was ...\nYeah and they're all just kind of I'm Sorry but in bed together and and that's how they make their money who's protecting the client and my clients looking at this paperwork\nAnd all these things that sound really great I'm like no don't touch it don't wave your right don't do it and and it's confusing for them because in in transparency some of it was confusing for me I told him I'm going to have to go home and review that\nSo the question would be as a as a buyer why would you go into a new build office without representation if that representation is free to you know\nBecause they're so nice well and you know what I think it usually is is that people just like to look I don't blame them for that but as soon as you go into the office by yourself and sign in they're not going to let you\nWell back it it does start by you touching the word booked for one one Ninety two three these are the things that we want to help our listeners with things that we want to educate you with a but the process starts by you grabbing a copy of our free book\nOr by Texan or book two for one one Ninety two three that's booked for one one Ninety two three and that's the problem is you're Bob announcer driving down the road they see the big American flag and and the balloons and I was just pull in it and um and so they pull in innocently they\nSigned the guess registry and they go okay this is great and I'm going to go back and get my agent well when you signed the guest Roger ... registry you've now forfeited your rights to having representation and now for going to go buy a house\nThere is a decent chance that you're going to get taken advantage of it of course you are because they have their best interest in mind\nIt's it's really kind of frustration frustrating the way the process works but it does matter I mean I have had to have my help my clients get out of new bill\nGet out of new bill purchased contracts either because of the way the houses are built in the problems they were having during the building process I've had to help my clients get out from underneath the lender that they were trying to get them to use with all of these different concessions\nAnd fight for a better loan product for them there is a lot that goes into it that you just don't think about so to have free representation is really worth the wait at just calling your age and saying hey I Want to go look\nAt times and if you're thinking about going out you're tempted this weekend K text toward new to for one one Ninety two three and we're going to get your somebody's number and have the ... and it's more than just having representation is Yuri is having the right

I've had I could tell so many stories about people who have said I'm I'm not really sure I'm not ready or I've already talked to somebody or you know I Can't do something and I think that's\nThe number one complement that people will give you even though they're telling me\nIs that oh she was so great she was so easy to talk to you I Love her she made me feel so comfortable she's so fun and like that's why we call her find Amy\nAnd there are other reasons too hard on the shit out\nOf that but it's important because this is a stressful thing for people and I think the number one concern is that you're going to start harassing them trying to push them into a mall and they can't qualify for that we're going to talk them into buying a house that they're not ready to buy\nSo when they call you and they really there's no strings attached and then you're not um telemarketing them afterwards that that's a real relief for people that you really are just giving them the information that they're asking for\nYeah and we keep it very simple and you know just in the last couple of months I've had I Would say probably three or four of my clients were turned down from another lender and they within thirty days of the first phone call from to me got their keys to their house at every single one of them less than thirty days and there were like we\nReally we dropped the stream of being able to purchase because we had one or two other people tell us we cut it and the bottom line was they just didn't know this mess so had well\nSuch a great point of view if you have been turned on by a lender\nAnd your lender you're agents or there's no way you can't get qualified and it may not be able to but you owe it to yourself you owe it to your family to get\nA second or a third opinion because it's a or we should probably one day just talk about that we we we experienced is all the time one of the common themes\nThat we get from work to your listeners\nIs they do text word fun and they go okay well I was turned down but you know I Want to give these guys are shot here and we should all the time and they give you a shot next you know\nIn a subtle you say oh great news but then they start working with Syria the rest of the team and next thing you know they are getting the keys to the house or three months ago someone told them they could have because that someone\nDidn't know what they're doing and if that as you please can you do to yourself you don't to me I don't care to yourself to your family or to get a second opinion or a first opinion\nOr you got to do a search word fun to for one one Ninety two or three that's fun to for one one Ninety two or three like\nThe common scenario is that someone helping them and they hit a roadblock and when they hit a roadblock then they say oh here's your options are going to wait six months are going to have you know do these things that are out of reach\nAnd then when they talk to you your experience and and the symptoms and creativeness of just looking at something and knowing how to put it together differently\nMakes all the difference and that's where your experience level really comes into play\nYeah and it's nice to have ... blood sweat and tears mortgages for the last Twenty years and you know to the detriment of my husband but its than to the benefit of you know all of our clients and you know we really truly just left to health and there are options\nAnd I'd also say 'cause we talked about getting ready for the holiday season and I'll be I'll be real I'll be you know they're going to be some people are going to touch toward fund for one one Ninety two or three and for whatever reason if it's not going to happen\nBy Christmas or in December but now we're on the road path that it might be first quarter or second quarter of two thousand Nineteen but today you can be equipped with the power you can be equipped with the knowledge and no and that's the thing is no your option\nAbsolutely and we will always put a path in place for you so let's say you call in you know that you really don't have great credit and your income is you know if he will tell you exactly what you need to do what steps need to take to qualify the following year so we won't just say oh no you can't qualify sorry and that's the end of that conversation unique\nOkay I well I Would hope that that's not the case that I hear that as\nI Will tell you this and I know that this was not going to come as a shock to the two of you are in a shouldn't come as a shock to anyone\nOr listeners but I absolutely love buffets and I love going to Vegas buffets my first one to go to Vegas\nGamma fell out of my chair\nBut it like to know what we love about those of us who love about both the these are the options you walk in and and you got this option in this option and this option and this option\nBut you go to a ... you go to a big bank you get to qualify you may not have options if you don't get pre quality if

mentioned in Joe mansions another one of those ones 'cause every these ones that you know Heidi Heitkamp is done she's twelve points behind it she was never the thought process if she was closer I tell you right now if it was a dead heat she would have probably voted for but she's so far behind at this point in time\nI don't know what she was doing that she's hoping that the Democrats throw throw in\nAnd help her out a little bit but man she lives in a weird world where he's in West Virginia a solid dead red state\nWhere he's a Democrat and he's gone against the Democrats on numerous occasions and and a lot of people are like well if this was one of those things where maybe they'd throw into the bulls for doing this if he was the fifty first though to put them over\nI Would say you know at some point in time he may look at you and go you know what I'm going to start just I'm going to be a Republican or an independent but\nHe is a Democrat in a state that is is dead read and you know so each one of these senators that swayed this thing today each one of them was in a situation where their their situation is extremely unique\nBecause there for some of them they're they're in places where there you know outside of their little area there's not a a lot of friendliness going on meaning the Republicans and Democrats states are Democrats and Republicans states\nAnd they did what they thought they had to do and some I looked at the way that Collins approach this today\nShe approached it in a way that had zero very little to do with the ... other than scolding some people on the ...\nAnd a and talked a lot about outside influence but also talked about him as a judge and a lot of things like that which I found to be very interesting and Mitch McConnell today wanted everybody to know how important\nThis thing was set up as the ... nomination\nEvery one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes\nAnd the ... that he said that on record saying and that's vitally important because some of these people that were going up against others and going in different directions you'd be surprised or some people are going to be primary out of this some

those things are going well ladies you you you might know a lot about this you go out on a date with somebody and they are saying they're self employed a lotta times what that means especially in certain generations is [noise]\nYou're unemployed you're just trying to survive and you're hustling and shocking and jiving yeah I'm self employed I'm an entrepreneur oh you don't have a job that is correct\nSelf employed ... unemployed is your urban word of the day thank you for saying that in dated urban planning so that our understanding that there was an urban were other day we damn stress shore cranium\nThe unemployment rate's actually the lowest ... the lowest rate we've seen since Nineteen sixty nine so I think that that sort of an firms by the other numbers we're seeing right now and that is that the economy is actually really healthy at the moment\nYes kind of me as healthy it feels healthy people I talk to\nTalk about you know what that this just it feels like it's motor along don't get me wrong we are going to have a slow down and hopefully it's not another crashed I don't think it will be but\nThe way we're spending and borrowing you never know but the ... this economy feels good and heading into a fourth quarter that is huge and I think this year we're going to be massive force quarter\nAnd it is a it is it is the confidence is there people are looking for jobs don't have to worry they're finding jobs and people are having the opportunity to to essentially ghost jobs are getting job offers and they're thinking this sounds good and the five minutes later they get another job offer\nIt is it feels like a real best a robust solid economy right now and and that's a lot of people that that that matters it does three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some show\nIs your Twitter let's switch gears for a moment some I find very interesting I you know basketball\nStarting NCA guys are starting to get ready for theirs and it is a crazy disgusting where are we talking about politics let me tell you about NCAA Basketball how weird as Michael ... new book out called the last temptation of a rich Pitino\nIt very interesting very interesting just chat about the ... [noise]\n... show [noise]\n\nHere's your healthcare update with America's health care advocate\nWith America's health care advocates carry hall does exercise really help keep you young as you get older I'll be back to tell you more\nSedentary lifestyle isn't good for anyone but kick you really should be avoided as we age although some age related muscle last may be inevitable\nAnd we get him here we have maybe a good run to the sweet sixteen the final four maybe a chance to the championship and then I got to turn around and retold his program every single year and that's where it gets weird Rick Pitino was one of the best of bringing them on in\nWell he was although you know one of the interesting things isn't that Pitino wasn't the best recruiter he wasn't getting all the best players um you know to his credit\nHe achieved the final four is a national championships with guys who weren't lottery picked she wasn't getting the players coach K was getting or or I'm Tyler Perry or Bill Bill self at Kansas um\nBut uh he apparently wanted one of them here with with Brian bow and junior and ah didn't play the game quite cleverly enough\nTalking about the game and and this is very interesting and for those people out there and making college more as we look at it we think oh it's it's it is if you're just kind of like the Olympics the reality is there's so much money there's billions and billions of dollars in it and one of the places that billions of dollars comes from is the athletic side of the the Nike or Adidas\nThe Under Armour the and one because these kids they go out to recruit them young ages you who you're going to play for which a Eugene but you go into the night camped you're going to the ... camp it's vitally important and then a lot of ways they'll try to funnel you to certain schools that are you know that have contracts\nThat's what happened here you know uh I think a lot of fans think well they want to\nPut shoes on kids in eighth grade or because they think that you know they they might be an end of this kid might be an NBA player and he's going to be a Nike a indoor sure when it gets the NBA\nThat's a small part of the center of what they really want to do what it is Nike and Under Armour largely want to do is funnel kids to the schools they sponsor\nAnd then they are human billboards you know within this amateur sport they are human billboards for whichever apparel they're wearing\nAnd that is one of the most cynical things so Louisville signed a just signed a hundred and sixty million dollar contract with a ... and all these kids are wearing Adidas stuff on the bookstore by the way you can barely find a book you know after you you know after you get through all the details gear and that's true\nYou know at Ohio State with Nike or\nUnder Armour at at UCLA where the former football coach said now everybody's going nowhere big time because we got this huge contract from Under Armour and it was like really\nYou have seven Nobel Prize winners who came through UCLA you had John Wooden and it takes being associated with them Under Armour to be the time so everything is sort of turned upside down by the money and by the commercial partnerships with a shoe companies\nTalking to Michael ... love and his new book which is amazing last temptation of Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball you know now we've got ... we've got all of this stuff money is huge March Madness the whole nine yards we always wink wink nudge nudge as we all play the pools and played the brackets and stuff\nI think this is going to affect the this moving forward because the NCAA's holding on for all they possibly can as far as their you know hey we're just amateurs their student athletes they get a free college ride but they see the money's at the coaches make that the NCAA makes and now you've got betting and how's that going to play into this\nWell the betting is just going to make it to ever bigger um you know the the the kids who play these games generate money in ways we don't even think of\nThe recruiting sites you know rivals dot com and uh you know the whatever bleacher report runs and I can't remember all the names of them but they're they're all these\nUh betting all these recruiting sites that that run on\nFocusing on the decisions being made by Seventeen year olds well you know what these are big businesses\nThe the the several of them have been bought or sold emerged in the last few years for like three hundred four hundred million dollars at least so\nYou've got that you've got you know all the hotels and restaurants that benefit you know that are sitting outside the stadiums and now you're going to have\nLegalized betting which means more betting and that's off the sweat and the muscle of the kids were playing the game so adjust well multiply the inequality that we have now and it's really intolerable you know you can't say after a while\nYeah you were giving you a thirty thousand dollar a year scholarship\nGuess what you're generating forty five million dollars in annual revenue at the University of Louisville\n... ah which was the highest of any of the schools but you know tens of millions everywhere\nYou look I ... and that's that that's the thing that's insane is how much money and I don't look I mean like this past weekend I watch Alabama destroyed the raging Cajun south Louisiana Tech or whatever was in football they're going to get their million dollar jak and that'll pay for the rest of their football season I understand is that it's a business\nAnd and that's that that's fine I got zero problems with that\nUh I just but I don't like is disingenuous by the NCAA that saying that hey this is this is not really business is all about amateur athletics when when you and I both know BS and the reality is the FBI had to look in this because the NCAA didn't want this stuff uncovered because they're they looked like they have egg on their face because they're allowing this stuff to go on right under their nose\nThat is all absolutely right I mean as all or a smog sort of fantasy that that these are amateurs show though I Will tell you that if you look at the FBI charging documents on the indictments the FBI comes off as pretty naive because their whole case is\nSort of positive on the the FBI has uncovered a this these ... this wrongdoing and these characters who they have indicted were violating the spirit of of amateur ism and and you know letting these in these players be\nCommercially exploited and I'm thinking well okay but the NC double a itself is is it commercially exploitive organization that didn't take\nA Christian Dawkins or was it was one of those charged or or these with these characters to exploit them they're\nThey're signing up for that basically 'cause that's the way the system is\nYou know the a ... thing is as always interests me because you'll hear about these guys and it doesn't you don't know it's it is it is we don't find basketball players playing high school basketball anymore it's what travel team are you on the ... you and some of those guys\nGenerate massive amounts of money they're making quarter million dollars coaching AAU basketball and some of them end up getting jobs these colleges if they bring the right kids with them and I think it's not just a college or an NCAA thing I think that it it goes much deeper that I don't think people realize that\nWell that's that's a big word of this problem the the grassroots circuit which is funded by the shoe companies and kids may play high school basketball but the hunting ground the recruiting ground is the ... circuit\nAnd college coaches love at first of all they're getting money from the shoe companies but it also means instead of and this was not even ... brilliant ... was the man at Nike who brought Michael Jordan to Nike and and pretty much designed a system um\nToward sunny understood as college coaches don't like going to high school games and getting on a plane and going to Dubuque, Iowa or wherever\nAnd seeing some six eight prospect compete against the uh five ten kid who is covering him so let's put together something we're number one all the best players are playing against each other\nAnd just as importantly let's put it in Las Vegas and our land though and let's let's put it in places where these college coaches can come and stay in five star hotels and eat great dinners at night\nUh so that's what you've got now so part of the unwinding of this whole system if you really wanted to do it would be to fend college coaches back to the small towns and high school gyms and believe me they don't want to do it\nWhat's what what what's the solution here going I must solutions based guy I I think at some point in time ... you've got to throw your hands up and say look this is the system we've got we've got to figure out a way to\nTo do you do not so much keep it in and keep a disguise but let's just be transparent about it\nAnd figure out the best way of dealing with it but going forward what do you think the best solution is is it is it that no more one in ... those kinds of things would that takes some of that out of it just either you're going to the NBA you're going to college for two or three years how do we work around this\nWell the number one and done which I think it's coming only takes the top ten or twelve kids out of this equation or they can go right to the NBA so that does a little but it doesn't do much uh the solution is to cut the kids\nIn this in to a significant part of the revenue which means not we're going to take your stipend up from three thousand ten thousand it means we're really going to pay you were going to figure out a way to pay your when\nThere's some people in the un ca who who don't want to do that I think there are some who do want to do it and legitimately can't figure out how and I and I get that because there are title nine problems you know they only they talk about revenues sports you're really talking about profit sports and that's men's basketball and college football\nSo can you pay them and not pay the women athletes is that right is it fair\nI really don't know they have they have to deal with that and then if you start paying people what if your quarterback\nBut if you're a quarterback who you\nYou know paid as a freshman and sophomore what did he starts thrown interceptions and and somebody somebody takes his job he cut his pay you're going to fire him or are you going to pay your star point guard on the basketball team more than the scholarship kid who's who's like the ninth or tenth player on the team\nWhat you were Monday morning with

actually for the sixth year in a row I was named one of the top one hundred a financial independent financial advisors or by parents and he\nSaid we love you very well\nThank you and uh but without our class we would be nowhere so therefore I put that one I give it to them now let me go over with you what we're going to talk about on this our weekly excursion into the land a personal finances so first of all I'm the economy is strong\nOkay by all measures we got a uh uh the employment data looked a little softer than people thought but that's okay it's still pretty strong about two hundred thousand jobs a month now which is an economy our side that's pretty darn good\nAnd so the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and we saw that the uh the ten year went a which is the most watched interest rate that to a ... look at has\nTraders look at has gone up and now it's looking like it's going to hover around three and a quarter if it stays there that's a big thing so I Want to

and uh you know Sean Connery would just not approve of that\nAnd one of the things I Know is that you do not want to see Sean Connery angry sorry about this [noise] I Know it's a good [laughter] it is indeed silly let's get on with the show as he says okay All right let's do that [noise] ah well let me introduce myself this is\nMoney matters with Kendall rape and I am your host Kendall right about\nThat [noise]\nI have been in the financial services business now for I've been a certified financial planner professional rather for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas we talked about with our love it and most valued clients\nAnd we currently work with a over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon so that's you this show is designed for you and uh in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd you know without our beloved clients we would be nowhere so I

all the things that we can think of to help you with your retirement planning we have articles are all kinds of stuff so money matters dot\nNet at our website [noise] so we're going to talk now about one of ... what we believe when when you retire you know you kind of become a defensive coordinator if we want to put it in football terms okay so when you are working and you're accumulating your on off that's\nRight so you're building you're putting money in your you have wages and all those kind of thing so you're living on that and you're putting your money away and so therefore and you have time on your side\nAnd so because of all of that you can be more aggressive in my opinion you can you can take a little bit ah you know ... of an aggressive stance but once you are within five years of retirement or five years after that ten year period\nThat is and and we've looked at it we believe it's one of the ... one of the most important periods of your entire financial life\nAnd if you do the math on it and you take a big loss or you do badly during that time you spend too much money or you do any of those kinds of things during that time what could happen is you could actually run out of money and uh that would not be good\nSo as we work with clients are we we take into account or Eighteen risks faced in your retirement\nAnd uh I Know Eighteen [laughter]\nThat you thought there were only three right but there are Eighteen and we're going to talk about number seven this week which is\nElder abuse and this is something that if you have a parent who's in their seventies or or older or they are the number one according to a\nA these studies that are ... are the targets for this kind of thing and so let me give you some stats on this is actually quite a a disturbing so the annual loss due to elder financial abuse\nTo point six billion dollars or many of the victims are never the same emotionally after being taken advantage of by someone they trust now here's the thing the typical victim as a woman Seventy to eighty nine years old however\nThe victims represent ... there is a diverse profile including older men and ah it also exists across all ethnic\nAcross all ethnic and socio economic groups so it's not limited just to a ... women but it is primarily a women um the biggest perpetrators fifty five percent of the perpetrators our families friends neighbors and caregivers\nBut actually what you gotta do it better starting back in a hand gun\nWell actually do that's a little extreme is that there might be a better way we'll talk about a better way of doing it then that a sixty percent of family perpetrators are adult\nChildren adult children\nYou know years ago we actually had that happened we had a client whose son was using his power of attorney to steal money from from that um the crimes often involve misuses of power of attorney stealing money using the credit cards you know they they do that borrowing against the elder person's home et cetera\nThe financial abused perpetrated by businesses can involve large sums of money and and and these these companies are if you want to call him that these these illegal people they it's like their business and they they can have hundreds of victims okay so what do you do about it well\nNow first of all I'm going to give you a little quick checklist here so you can protect yourself from ... or by staying organized\nYou know first of all no where everything you've got is and what it's doing so when you get a call that says you know you your investment or whatever is a ... something's happening there you know that it's not true I'm\nOpen and send your own male\nOkay don't have somebody else reads your e mails for you open your mail for you or anything like that because they'll get communications that will have your account numbers and all those kinds of things on it and then they can take advantage of that\nSame thing with signing of checks and and credit cards and all that kind of thing to do it yourself don't have somebody else to do that for you\nSet up a direct deposits for all checks that you get you know for example Social Security other things to make sure that any regular checks that you get a direct deposit it to your bank because if they are sent to your house somebody gets it and guess what okay\nUse use your voice mail if you get a call from somebody from a a a a number that you don't recognize don't answer that let it go into voicemail listen to the voicemail and then decide if you want to go after that\nAnd then finally make sure that uh you're wills your advanced directives powers of attorney are executed to ensure that only trusted individuals can step in to make decisions for you okay\nAnd and if you are a child of an older person than those same things would apply for you okay so just something for you to think about now as I mentioned we are a retirement planning specialist we work with people primarily who are over fifty who are

rape and of course I Am your host Kendall rights\n[noise]\nJak and you know if a lousy says go back to their spouses when the stock market goes down then I bet there were a lot of family reunions on in two thousand and eight and nine would you say\nAny way we are back I Am ... the host of money matters with Ken ... I've been in the ... I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these our ideas that are designed around retirement planning because we are a retirement planning specialists and that we currently work with over a thousand four hundred beautiful wonderful families\nAre in forty three states and we are blessed and honored and uh\nFor the second year in a row of money matters are from is a finalist in the two thousand uh Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch awards for ethics yes calmer\nA and we'll we'll know if we're going to be a winner last year we were a finalist and this year we are on November first the award ceremony will tell us if we will win the the grand prize but\nJust to be nominated just to be one of the uh um you know the people that are in in the running for ethics by the better Business Bureau we perceived to be a very nice thanks so we're very proud of that now one of the foundational philosophy that we have because we are a retirement planning specialist and and and primarily worked with people who are over the age of fifty\nUm is that we believe that when you\nAre retired or five years before retired you should be very defensively minded okay now you want to grow your money okay we want you to go out and enjoy your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to do that okay so they'll play whatever that means you have great fun enjoy travel family\nGolf tennis maybe I Love tennis\nYou know go do whatever it is that you love doing\nBut just always remember that when it comes to your finances if that's going to support your lifestyle\nYou have to make sure that it's there to do it [laughter] okay does that sound logical to you\nSo therefore we believe that you should protect your principal\nYou spent twenty Thirty years building it and now you don't want a market crisis or a a bear market like Y. two K. or two thousand eight to come in and raw view of half your money or something like that guy so we believe that you need to protect what you've built\nAnd by hold which is kind of the mainstream if if you if you are ... ... if you\nLook at it that way idea of investing is that you buy a quality package of investments and then you rebalance them you know periodically and your job is done because you're a long term investor and everything's going to work out\nWell we don't agree with that I mean we agree with that you should buy equality set of investments you should diversify you should make sure that you're taking only as much risk because it's necessary so we believe all of that and you should rebalance we believe that as well but we believe that is all incomplete\nBecause no matter how you know if you look at two thousand and eight for example\nA diversification only work if you had treasuries pretty much you know everything else lost money so\nYou know and not every single thing but if you look at it in general or the stock market went down and many bonds went down and says like where where could you hide in two thousand eight\nSo we believe you need to have an overly you need to have a strategy to sell to actually get out and you know traders on a on Wall street and I said T. R. A. D. E. R. not trade tours but traders um ... most traders have\nWhat they call a stop last strategy okay they invest but they already know when they're going to sell when they invest that's just smart you know you got to know is Kenny Rogers used to say you got to know when to hold them and when to fold up you don't just keep playing because uh uh losing hand is not a good idea\nSo therefore we believe you buy hold and you also selling in November of two thousand seven\nWe told ... those who are listening to show we and uh and and anybody that gets our weekly market alert email\nThe market alert email um our clients we said it was time to get out of the stock market or strategy has signaled does that and we actually said to stay out for a almost Eighteen months almost a year and a half\nUm until June of two thousand nine so those of you that followed the that that uh advice you were out of the market or the stock market to a and hopefully that helped to avoid large losses now\nThe by hold argument against that that I've heard is that if you sell you know what do you where are you going to put it you're gonna put it in cash and the answer that I says yes and I mean money markets and that kind of thing uh but if you do that you're not going to make any money\nAnd so you know that that one really gets makes me actually frustrated because in a in a period of crisis\nYour focus is on protecting its not building I mean think about there's a there's a hurricane coming okay it's a massive hurricane that's coming\nAnd you're saying okay batten down the hatches well no don't do that because now you can't keep building\nWhat does that mean you don't like what are you going to be building for when does a hurricane coming that's not the time to be thinking about building it's a time to think about batten down the hatches and protect yourself protect what's there don't let it get crushed in the hurricane\nSo in your investment world thinking about growing in a time when there's a market crisis to me it's like you got your eye on the wrong ball what are you thinking about you got to protect what you have\nSo this notion that you're going cash you don't make any money first of all I disagree with it just philosophically but secondly you know Benjamin Franklin once said that a penny saved a penny earned\nAnd if you sell and the and your investments that you didn't ... that had you stayed in go down to me whatever they go down by ... earnings\nOkay so in two thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred index went down what forty percent plus so if you were out of the stock market if you're out of the S. and P. when that happened in my view what that means is the penny saved that forty percent plus that you didn't lose that's the forty percent that you made and to me that's pretty darn good\nNow the other part of this that I just wanted to say is that a yes it's true that right now interest rates are low but this is anomalous you know these interest rates we've seen the last ten years that that's not normal I mean if you go back in history there's very few times and we've had zero percent interest rates\nSo while it's true now I don't know that it's it it would be true in the future also so that whole argument about if you sell them going cash you won't make any money just does not hold water with me All right now if you believe\nIf you are over fifty if you are retired are retiring soon and you believe that uh you want to go enjoy your your second child and you want to go play and have fun but to do that you believe that you also have to protect what you've built\nThan we may be the financial advisory firm for you and so you can go to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd what you'll see on there is two options one is you can go to one of our seminars and we have seminars near you and you can sign up for that and will love to have you there or or you can click on meat with an advisor and if you do

... that's awesome you don't change every time you twist your rich risk and see what\nI'm going to try that cause on I have the apple watch for I mean you have to three feet or about your president [laughter] I've been using the fire one\nYeah I Know you want to personalize the pictures of your family I Am going to do that so uh Roger called up he was a new job yes and a ... as many calls start with I got an email [laughter]\nYou got an email from someone saying that they know he's been on adult Web sites\nAnd to prove it they told him the passport he you owe when he was on there was a dog and the password was correct correct and if he doesn't give them seven thousand dollar they are going to send everyone in his contacts list\nThe movie he was watching in a video of him and watching that movie\nThat shifts nasty now he says he's not too worried because of the time that he had that password the computer you had had no camera so unless they were outside filming and they're not going to have a video of him but he still wants to know what the heck is useful\nOkay now this is this is really common is this more common than you might think because I've noticed that as I've been going through my you know I read every emails from listeners I noticed that as I've been going through the email is that that seems to be ... oh yeah it's crazy stuff [noise]\nAll right so Roger you're not overly concerned about seven thousand dollars in a sex extortion scam as crazy isn't it\n[laughter] yeah that that's one last word for it [laughter] All right and this was a how long ago was this [noise] [noise] well I use that power for probably seven or eight years ago and then have you you it is not very often because\nYou know passwords had become more difficult where you add numbers and symbols and everything and this didn't have any of that so it was an older parents work\nBut I used it for everything so I don't know if they actually got it up at the website or if they ... the other company or something right and just said it was often adult website [laughter] no it\nWasn't one of the things that you can do is that there's a website have I been pond\nHe W any day and you can type in your email address and it will tell you whether or not the hackers have gotten a any passwords associated with that email address\nBut you gave a couple of clue it's like one of ... you said like you know you use that password on the same password on a lot of different sites which you know quite frankly don't feel like a dummy 'cause a lot of people did until we realized that that was probably not the best idea okay I was a dummy\n[laughter] okay and you are still using up has heard that that if I were with you I Would just like you know slap you right across the face for doing that because you need to stop using a password okay\nNow what ... what's happening in is that these are hackers are getting hold a username and password and then they are crafting these emails
