going\nTo find if I had money to bat I don't think they're going to find out\nIf I had money to bed by money to throw out there I don't think they're going to come up with much of\nAnything I Do\nNow the dams came out that I said well we were looking at some of these other things\nThese these things the FBI or the patch and we think there's a\nThere's some ... some some issues year there do everything they can just stole right look anybody what if you're the Republicans you're doing the same thing at this point in time\nBecause this is generational so you just throw everything up you possibly can you weren't going to do with oil like look we've got to leave it out on the field there's nothing else there is no coming back from this if we can't convince these four or five senators to to get off the cabinet train then we're done\nWe're done we got nothing we can't stop it at all so I don't know what's gonna happen my money is\nThere going to come back and they're going to say\nIt would really find anything because the FBI keeping score\nSenate has more power for these kind of ... and the FBI\nRight like this doesn't make you feel good situation with the FBI will make you feel good because they didn't think it would happen so whatever they could do to throw up the Democrats did go to that's what you're supposed to do with a situation like this your fighting for something you believe in saying that you need to destroy human beings and\nBy that I mean both Dr Ford and Kevin I don't think you do but you did and now you're in a situation where\nGonna happen what's gonna happen he's been hammered\nHe's been hammered for the last twenty four hours because\nOf what he said but this was interesting and if you didn't hear this this is this is Joe Scarborough MSNBC Mika Brzezinski Joe Scarborough Morning Joe saying something that quite frankly many of you will agree with and that'll shock you\nAnd you've got a new bill a accounts and makes it is a introducing gets the oversight acts which I Am very interested in I think a lot of other people was because the VA this entire mess started right here and we still feel like we're still trying to clean this thing up\nA chair and you are so right I mean look at a new report just came out today that Phoenix VA hospital is still only a one star that's the lowest she can get and a lot of places getting cleaned up the Phoenix legs all of that so what I what I'm trying to do is get a\nPilot program and the Phoenix\nWhere we can get some oversight right in there a congressional oversight so that I can get my staff in there to the Phoenix VA\nAnd and really try to figure out what's going on\nAnd so we can help out I mean 'cause we get veterans we got two guys that's all they do is veterans claims every\nYou know it's it's insane that we are still out of one and I look at something like this and say okay so what exactly is this thing and there was this thing gets through what exactly is going to start holding people's feet to the fire which is what I think a lot of people want a Congressman Bass people to to have accountability for not doing the things that they're supposed to be doing\nWell and that's exactly right here on the private sector you don't perform your gun so we actually pass the ball or passed a law earlier this year the saying that\nThe the secretary can actually fire these folks that they're kind of they're not fully it will but they they can fire them speed up the process to get rid of people who shouldn't be working there my bill actually um\n... we we try and we've tried to get people from my staff to be able to work at the southeast regional center and at the Phoenix the center uh they let us come into the the southeast center maybe I think is twice a month every other Wednesday\nFor like three hours and they're busy the whole time and we need to be there so we can help facilitate claims and tried to get this stuff going\nAnd they haven't wanted to do that and and I know that there are other places in the country they've allowed that we can't seem to get it in here so we have to pass a law and bits to they don't even have a liaison shed the ... the Knicks doesn't even have a liaison for a direct person first call and say we're working on case number ... or a\nX Y Z please please help us with it we've got a ... it's it's not developing and while there's some people would get good ... good experience I don't want to say they're not trying to make progress I think they're making some ... it's just not fast enough and Phoenix lags behind the whole country\nAnd that's not good again in the spotlight was on us for a very long time and it still didn't do anything it didn't lie to fire the way it should we are talking to congressman Andy Biggs a bipartisanship obviously I mean a lot of people looking at it the veterans of course we want to be a part of this thing or do you think is a lot of fighting to push back\nYou would think that there shouldn't be I mean 'cause everybody talks to the game even in Congress and so uh you know we were going to get some bunch of people to sign on co sponsored this bill let's see if we can make it a bipartisan bill shouldn't be bipartisan there should be no nobody that's really beefed about this now\nShouldn't be anybody at okay we moved from there to a Jeff Flake obviously he's thrown the country into a disarray apparently is oh my God this is all happening with Kavanaugh it looks like the the report is John and they'll start reading it tomorrow how do you think he handled everything\n[noise] well\nLet's put it this way I think he's going to vote yes because last last friday he said you know you do this FBI report and an investigation them I can I can vote for him and I ... I think that's a yes and and so if that's the case then been all's well that ends well right I mean but\nWe'll see how that played\nOne of his place when you watch something like this because you're in the political game and this is what you do you look around and this and and ...\nAnd you talk to fellow Democrats 'cause you know you guys aren't on it and I know that everybody likes to think that you guys just sit around and stared each other just like it's the sharks and the jets and you're going to throw down and we know that's not true\nAh did they understand it they they get it that it's a game they get to that it's it's it's a battle to to make sure the bases happy what did they say you know off the record if you will not given out names that some of them have to go this is ridiculous\n[laughter] well some of them have told me that um you know not very many do because you have to understand this is the war and this is this is the the ultimate battle of the wars who controls the Supreme Court and so they use is\nNot as a game anymore I mean there's a lot of things I think that they say okay that's\nThings I think that they say okay that's ... will let that go you know we're gonna mess around with you but this is a war and this is the battle that they're fighting right now this is where the truth got lived up\nIf you were to put money on it so here we are go hey congressman any big here with is a good source of money down or do you think he gets confirmed\nIt would be safer if we'd better but you know whether my house was gonna spontaneously bus tonight you know the ... the reality is I think he was going to be confirmed\nBut I don't think the I think the three or four or five people who are\nReally the the swing of it is they're not they're not saying that I got to believe that he's going to be confirmed a because there's just no corroborating corroborating evidence on the ... the allegations a side of it\nAnd the other ... what do you want without what do you want with like due process in evidence that's just really we've got to just go on whatever somebody says\nDo you worry and it I think this is this is important in this day and age because the obviously you know people who are in politics now it's no longer just the op ed piece on a Sunday that you might have to go\nEat his day to day twenty four hours a day or you know bases are attacking each other and they're going after politicians they're confronting them in ways that we haven't seen it very long time\nHave you take that nowadays I mean 'cause it is completely different than it was ten Fifteen Years ago\n[laughter] well let's let's just be honest this is more physically dangerous as well so\nThe the way you looked at it as she is you got to be I I tried to take care of like this I'm going to tell people think\nI'm going to vote the way as I say I am\nAnd then the people like it they can vote for me if they don't like it they can vote against me but the reality is\nA it it's not even that easy because uh you know when I see the video Mitch McConnell getting accosted at the airport is as well so I said oh that happened to me one time though like are you serious as yes I'm Serious you know you you you can't\nGo somewhere without being concerned that you're going to be a cost of your family is going to be a cost it\nUm I've so [laughter] you know like the CIA has always seem to be on the plane is that a un too big and I said why are you asking [laughter] you know one thing\nBecause it is gone it's gotten out of control and I'm at and I you know I tried to rein in matching waters with emotion century because she inflamed the stuff Cory Booker and plunge this stuff\nOr you know it we've got a raft with this now\nBut he's got his articles moment that's all that matters because he's running for president [laughter]\nWell that's perfect moment turned into something he didn't want it to you about three hours later\nYeah well it's it's it's it's I I you know I just think we can do better I think you know we're all Americans and at some point in time you know the left in the in the right to have to unite and at least start looking each other's instead of tribal looking at each other's hey we're just you know we're ... you know we were going to agree to disagree at times and that's okay but the way we're doing it now and\nThe insanity thing and the edge of the ... it's insane ... congressman Arizona right there appreciate your coming on talking about the new\nBill is we'll see how that thing goes keep us up then it will do will do\nThink that she had been to chose your Twitter ... and so and you can tweet at us love hearing for me to get ... and show a TV on the old uh will\nCome up to you too but that was the children to do that nowadays a lot of stuff still to get through the night I Want to talk about\nAh the median Trump ...
