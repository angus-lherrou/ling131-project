been broken now it will ... due to the right as I tried to tell everybody last week Ninety seven percent of what Merrick Garland did\nHe did meaning they agreed on a lot of things and and I'm going to break down some stuff for you tonight I Want you guys to understand that the writers when he gets ready for this he understands\nForty percent plus\nOf the stuff that comes down in Supreme Court as far as rulings are unanimous very rarely is it five to four\nLast week and this past two or three weeks has been an absolute giant joke in fact I sell CNN poll today that said America\nDid not like the way that the Republicans handled Kavanaugh and did not like the way the Democrats handled Kavanaugh and Ford did not like it not one bit not one out could not stand it\nIt was a joke it really was this past weekend watching people get out there and and and and go crazy some of it I thought was real raw emotion because these people are being fed right some of these young women and women are being fed a dose of\nNot reality but what if\nWhat if the world was to go the way the cabinet everybody's going to be in The Handmaid's tale everybody's going to be doomed it's all a slow your role everybody take a deep breath and slow your real life not coming to an end things are going to move forward\nThe way the ... and and part of the reason the things are going to move forward in in a way that I think it's good is because of the way that I think the Supreme Court is going to handle things not with a new Supreme Court justice comes on\nIts they pick a few cases\nRemember a lot of a lot and I do mean a lot of cases\nGet thrown up to the Supreme Court but doesn't mean that they take everything that comes their way many times they don't take any of the things that come their way they kick it down and they say you know what will look at this a little bit later or go back down refer to the old ruling\nThey're going to you're going to see somebody like a sudden my or and and and and Kagan and Toledo and and yes yes I'm going to go out there and say kids\nJustice chief Supreme Court justice the one Roberts is going to get feedback from all of these justices about the things that they're going to handle first and part of that is going to be politically motivated to do to slow down\nSome of the tribalism at the craziness to give people the reassurance the court is exactly that it's a court it's not here just politics only and this is how we're going to view it if you are to the right you this if you're lucky because remember when Obamacare went to the\nThe court's it was chief justice Roberts who cited\nEssentially with what we call the left\nSo he wants to restore faith\nAnd there's a way of going about doing it doesn't mean that people ... on on the right especially lawyers and and certain states aren't licking their chops with the opportunity to come after things but just because they lick their chops and the opportunity to come after things like like roe v Wade

keeps talking about let's ask Emily Ryan she's a political consulting with copper say consulting group right here in the valley Emily how are you today\nAnd get on gray how are you\nGood so David Garcia is down by double digits in the latest poll is there any way you can come back and win\nAbsolutely not I I think the races over early ballots go out tomorrow the race has already overdo the one that\nReally so no so no chance whatsoever he can't do anything to get the numbers back to single digit or do you try to home wave yeah yeah do you even trust the polls though\nWhat you know we learned a powerful lesson about how Ron Paul can be and twenty sixteen\nThan way more than just the poll results we've seen are really poorly run campaign out of the Garcia camp and as we get closer to election day the lead that Governor do the hat is actually growing which in the wrong track from Garcia and it would take an October surprise and by that\nI mean a really bad shocking that if NATO about governor do see and the money tell that story\nFor Garcia to pull him down in numbers and make any ground and I don't see it happening\nI don't see it happening either David Garcia has run a big campaign you know we were supposed to have 'em on Wednesday and they canceled on this Monday for no reason really whatsoever there's only like less than thirty days left to the election I mean if this guy doesn't want to come on the biggest talk show and you know get his point across maybe he doesn't know what his point is\nAnd that's why you staying away from the media but we offered him an hour on the air\nAnd the guy said yes and then he backed out it makes me think they don't know what the heck they're doing over the Garcia camping\nI only have to agree with you know he seemed like a great candidate there was a lot of democratic energy around this election and this seemed like it that there was a chance for the Democrats to take a shot at having a governor and this would be ... and they just squandered\nHow good can this be the last to die in Douglas a couple of years ago I mean dying Douglas is one of the worst politician we know why she won that are either for him but if you can't be dying Douglas you're not going to win anything on\nAnd we may see this may be the last campaign that you see Garcia Ryan person he's probably really shaking their head right now it's friend Deval he's probably thinking why didn't I wait ... but it's just been a missed opportunity for them and he's a nice man when you meet Mr Garcia he looks good on paper but they cannot seem to pull it off\nWe're talking with Emily Ryan she's a political consultant with ... consulting group right here in the valley David Garcia said he's counting on hidden votes to win the election we're still not sure what that means what is a hidden vote\nYou know that's not an industry term them that might be something new to their campaign but I think what he's probably referring to cross over voters maybe people\nWho haven't voted in a long time but he can pull from the Republican Party over to his side or maybe from the independent center swath of voters but you know if you're going to do that you can't run as a ultra progressive activists\nLike who wants to open the border but I don't get the strategy\nThe one thing that that I didn't understand about Garcia or about governor do see is how do you get the independent vote unless you just stay pretty much in your lane motion with with Syria as soon as he said imagine no wall on the southern border\nRight who's turns to talk or are we mentioned Jan Brewer no ... who started as it's talk because there was an\nI there was a there was a bit of a a a silence there that was an uncomfortable\nPregnant pause text word\nPot on line three

it is because they're struggling she does that with their fans are fans follow her so Taylor Swift is different they feel emotionally connected to very much so\nBut does that mean they're going to
