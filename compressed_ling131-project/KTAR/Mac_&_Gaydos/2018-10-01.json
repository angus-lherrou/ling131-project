think he's like the boy who cried wolf I think this is the guy who wants us to think he struggled with this decision but he knows what he's going to do at the end and right now he's just trying to save face he wants people to think he's the good guy\nBy asking for an investigation but really in the end he's all bark and no bike\n[noise] well uh I I actually have a little different take I really take him at face value I think I'm part of this comes from his faith I think\nUm I think Jeff Flake really is bothered by the the the rancor in D.C that's not his normal default position to be a guy who you know [noise]\nUm is a scrap or and battles I think his relationship with Chris Coons is really really important in this thing and I think he genuinely felt\nThat um the Senate was coming unraveled and he felt the country was coming unraveled unless they could find some middle ground and because he's a swing vote I mean you've got four votes on that in the Senate\nUm who are critical Collins Murkowski flake or and maybe Joe mansion so he's one of those people who really they're the only people that matter at this point they're right on the bubble and they will decide this thing in the Senate I think he really felt somebody needed to\nHit the hit the pause button and I think he felt for Kavanaugh for everyone involved if the FBI looked at it that could be some middle ground that would appease the Democrats and and also probably provide cover for cabinet and Republicans if they go forward\nJohn ... ton anchor for five and nine o'clock news can that's my take on it I mean I and and then I\nKind of take them at face value guys I Know nobody wants to do that anymore with politicians and maybe I'm being naive but I think he was genuinely upset by what was going on back there and I think Lindsey Graham's outburst even cabin on a losing his cool I think all of it he just thought we've got to be\nThan this and I think that's really where he's coming from\nOkay I ... and I I totally hear you and I don't think you're naive\nI just don't understand it looked as though during that last last friday's a Senate hearing\nIt looked as though somebody was taking rusty razor blades

know there's one person at the party that knows the the the end gender of the baby and that person basically put the whole party together and they're you know you have the you have the the reveal right right\nWell and the parents are not supposed to know that ... right so there was a gender reveal party in green valley Arizona heck is that back you and do you know were green valley Arizona is it\nSouth of here down around Tucson oh no wonder we haven't heard about it right anyway now I'm\nAt this gender reveal party was it a boy or a girl or a fire\nUh yeah it was a fire yeah it was a dentist Dickey Dennis Dickey Dennis taking\nOff duty a border patrol agent yes he wanted to go big or go home and guess what he went big and then you had to go home because he started a wildfire any burn forty seven thousand acres yeah it was the sawmill fire it started because of a gender reveal party oh my goodness dubbed the saw mill fire\nIt caused a forty seven thousand acre wildfire racking up roughly eight point two million and government cause according to the Arizona Daily Star the fire started after Dickey shot a rifle at a target containing colored powder\nCity miss no the powder\nOr the the the explosion was made by Tanner right which is legal but highly explosive\nThat went everywhere\nAnd started the fire but the substance was illegal compound called Tanner right ten or ... yeah the shining nodded when he did know ever since it was not considered a willful act\nDickey was charged with our son however he told the judge I feel absolutely horrible about it it was probably one of the worst days of my life but the child will have to pay back the eight million dollars in damage that's what I hear no matter if it was a boy or girl yeah when he or she gets a job right we're going to take it from\nThe government out of the garden that child garnish wages that is not true they are\nNot [laughter]\nAn Arizona man has been signed two hundred and twenty thousand dollar that's\nA lot of money yeah yeah maybe that child should be named Smokey [laughter]\nThat child should go on a Smokey the bear campaign I get awful so should they outlawed gender revealed party since it caused eight point one million dollars in damage\nI think neither too near Tucson they should near ... near well so that when I went with a green involving rifles gender a rifle at a gym to reveal party just doesn't seem ... America well that's true shooting shooting at a target\nWith a high powered rifle so we would explode in pink or blue powder that he was trying to do no word on what the gender reveal actually was the Dickey having said if the child was a boy or\nGirl how do we know what he's sick around to find out you know the powder explode and nobody remembers because the fire erupted are they going to know if it was a boy or a girl what do you mean you\nKnow how do you know how to you know I think I Know you were there because he thinks\nHe knows everything I Know I don't know what I like to call them on it ... yeah mhm so what do you think Dennis Mickey's progeny is going\nTo be a boy oh boy yeah the name of smoking I liked that idea but wow eight point two million dollars in costs all over\nAnd explode some idea and because it wasn't intentional he doesn't have to pay back anything for his explosive idea uh I don't know\nI think you shouldn't be fired from the border patrols and it's dangerous I don't I ...
