down a what a prop three or five is\nOK well proposition three o five is one of those that has the lungs fancy name which to me indicates there's something there trying to hide so it's called the expansion of empowerment scholarship accounts [noise]\nMost regular people would just call those private school vouchers so these are debit cards that folks can say hey you know I don't want my kids to go to the local public school or even a charter school I went to home school or even or to private school\nSo the state loads tax dollars onto a debit card males it to this family and says okay here you go we we hope that you go and and educate your child with the is right now\nIn Arizona we have this program but it's only for kids and really unique circumstances like kids with disabilities kids in foster care\nKids of military families so proposition three o five is asking us to expand it every single kid in the state any kid can get this debit card loaded with tax dollars whether or not they have any kind of need for alternative schooling\nNow I'm a huge fan of choice of always been a fan of choice and coming from California being stuck in a situation where there is no choice you've got the unions that are over powerful\nI liked the idea of choice the problem is like everything else is the unforeseen circumstances that come with it which is when you start handing dollars out to people with no real regulation it gets wasted and that's one of the big issues I have with us\nYeah definitely and I would agree with you one hundred percent and save our schools actually the moms who formed save our schools all of us in Phoenix here\nUm we are a mix of using private school in public schooling in charter schools so we're right there with your choice is great but someone shouldn't have the choice to do something irresponsible with all of our tax dollars\nSo a word is always important and they used as we're talking about proper three or five with Don Pettit Zach or a the communications director of save our schools Arizona\nAnd that's always been one of the things 'cause I I don't know how many times I was just talking about can gate us about this and it's like they're like the prophet drive me crazy it it is because you're like OK wait a minute or so my vote no means ... vote we know a vote yes it's it means really no I don't want it but if I don't know it means yes it's confusing\nAnd as we've seen was one of the the big things here that was shot down because trying to raise more money and became to tax grab\nThe way it was written is vitally important and and this seems to be you know again the the empowerment thing sounds like a good idea in the hands of wrong people do and and we all know abuse I don't think it will be widespread but there's enough to make you go\nThat way I mean we don't want to expand that program that has enough bugs and laws and loop holes in it that those few bad apples can go to town and right now that's how it's written 'em and all of that is kind of on the backdrop that you know the public schools and the charter schools that Ninety five percent of families are choosing\nTheir barely scraping by I mean there are starving so every dollar that goes on to one of these e essay debit cards is taken out of a public or charter school it's not a separate account\nSo you know all of the the business community has said we cannot do this like we need to be able to hire skilled labor we need to have a workforce for the future\nTo have a workforce for the future we cannot suck money out of the public schools that are graduates are coming from so I think it's just not the right time it's not the right time for this\nSo again up I'm a huge but I'm One of these people I like joy so the choice was a wonderful thing I think when we have choice we have competition I think it makes everything better we how much money are we talking because we do have a huge issue here in Arizona and the fact is on the the we have not funded the way that we we should of and\nKatie a our eyes on immigration the director of the ice field office in Phoenix houses border agents are seeing an influx of immigrant families

and and and stuff like that it was kind of funny but it was a surreal moment today and a lot of people are chime in about it and ah it was a it was just a very interesting thing and I love how the left has already deemed him crazy and lunatic\nBecause he doesn't buy into a lot of their stuff and doesn't follow him in everything they do because in the left it's just the thing you do is hate

a lot of people that have moved here from California and that's their fear so somebody who's who who wants to this thing ... who's pushing this that's the big thing because it's got to be the service companies who you know they always look at the fine print of who's paying for these ads\nYeah it's one industry it's the national uh realtors association\nThey passed this in Missouri a couple of years ago and now they picked Arizona to try this again they're spending five million dollars in Arizona\nSo and why are they doing that well if I have five million dollars that I could get special protections to say I would never be taxed in our state constitution you if you got that kind of money you can do it but you know this actually I think hurts realtors because\nWhat realtors depend on to sell homes they depend on your good schools in their neighborhoods police fire roads this was going to jeopardize the funding for that\nAbsolutely talking to a David Luanda director of the Arizona Center for economic progress\nSo uh how would you watch the ads and I and I talked to a lot of people we started talking about ... and and I said hey you know we were talking about perhaps a lot of people are so confused about which way to vote that's their big thing they understand but they're not quite sure as I get my vote yes does that mean no and if I vote no does that mean yes how does this work\nUh in these ads are so confusing and there are so misleading and ... insane how was the polling going for this right and what's your sense that this thing is going to happen is\nYeah it's not looking good I mean and I can totally understand that the realtors have been on the air since early August like I said they got five million dollars to spend we have basically zero um and and their their commercials sound like you know we're going to tax veterinary services and health care which is not the case\nUm and so the polling showing that this is passing and so it's really important that we're getting the word I Want to sex is bad for Arizona\nI'm people need to vote no for it and that's why you see Republicans and Democrats governor do C and D Eva Garcia and I'm a long list of mayors and other people all coming out opposed to this 'cause they know what's going to be bad unfortunately we just don't have the money to to put up the fight\nThis is crazy I'm going to give you exactly one minute here to make your pitch to the people of Arizona or two of why this is a bad idea\nYeah uh well why don't you don't have to worry about veterinary services in child care and health care being taxed because we already have in our constitution a requirement that it would take two thirds of the legislature to to increase those taxes maybe that might happen but I can tell you having been a state legislator for eight years\nUm we have not the legislature has not raised taxes in Arizona since before Nineteen Ninety two so it's unlikely that we're going to see that you know you don't see those dark rooms of plotting these tax increases here I'm so vote no on prop one to six\nThey really want is the director of Arizona Center for economic progress appreciate your coming on tonight and that can be interesting to see what happens but when you got five million dollars versus zero\nMore often than not the way the world goes in and and the ... the frustration

Monday I says we don't have enough room there are legal and logistical reasons why we are you can say escorting dumping whatever word you want to use dropping off dropping off asylum seekers\nAt area churches area centers that are taking in these people I says you know what we just don't have the room we're not we're not prepared for this we talked to are news director Marc Mauer who spoke to the field office head of ice here\nYesterday and she got a lot of answers but man this story is just ... this is not going to go away for a while so Martha ... ask where are these people coming from is in Mexico\nThe majority of the apprehension and I'm I'm Talking about people caught at the border the majority of them are not coming from Mexico even though our border with Mexico and they're coming from Central America it's higher than eighty percent are coming from Guatemala alone\nI didn't know that yesterday I thought that was a shocker I mean we knew that they were coming from Central America right eighty percent coming from Guatemala so what is happening in Guatemala\nI mean is what we hear is it is it the gangs is it people did violence just being so poor that I cannot eat on a daily basis that they have to come here so we were thinking about this story and somebody who popped in her head\nWas our friend and former Arizona attorney general grant woods 'cause a grand adopted daughter from Guatemala and actually I think his daughter I think it was Fifteen Years ago my daughter went back there for the first time\nSo why don't we welcome in grant which K C A R grant how are you my friend hope you're doing well from\nDoing All right thanks guys\nSo we found out over eighty percent of immigrants who attempt to cross the border into Arizona are from Guatemala I'm your daughter returned to Guatemala for the first time since he left Fifteen Years ago right\nShoo there um she ... and I'm\nMarlene are there right now um they they spent a week they're\nWorking at an orphanage I'm sad to say more of an age where we got a a but but I'm a it's an orbited share on there in the same vicinity and so yeah it's it's quite an experience for I think it's the first time she's been back to she was six months\nOr to the day when we got her and then um now she's Fifteen and a half so um yeah I think it's it's a real eye opener for her\nAnd I think it's you know we just thought it was it would be a great learning experience for her and it's a chance for her to get back also uh she's she's now or she was called ... now because uh her she's going to sponsor a one of the little girls in this uh in this particular orphanage\nWow wow from Arizona attorney our attorney general grant woods joins is talking about the people and the the very bottom Allah what is your wife telling you what is your daughter telling you who are these people that are coming here claiming asylum and why are they coming can you give us some insight into that\nWell I think we have a little bit of insight it's um it's a pretty tough place I'm a ... from Guatemala City I'm In the outskirts there\nAnd um there there there are a lot of ... there there's a there's a lot of poverty as you said and a tremendous amount of violence and I think I think um\nWhen they need to remember is these people who are seeking asylum they're doing it the right way so this was not people tried to get here illegally they're not\nCrossing over the border in the middle of the night you know in bands who dozens or hundreds\nOr hundreds they they are presenting themselves for asylum that's what we've told them to do\nAnd they have a right then to have a hearing in our country has always been a refuge for uh people if they are fleeing a pressure and the more violence in particular and I I think the situation in in Guatemala it it's been this way for a while so basically I Would describe it this way first everywhere you go\nIt's not me but you know grant woods let's see if he runs for Senate yeah if you run he's going to have to run as a Democrat though right [noise] well not going to run as a Republican you basically he said that flat out but he's going to have to run as a Democrat why because the money is there and it'll help him\nIf he runs his independent they're not going to be any money\nSo coming up next we want to continue talking about um how ISIS dropped off

true and what is not true\nFrom what I read if you are a woman with kids\nYou get better treatment and you have a faster track than say twenty six year old man from Guatemala or Mexico and claim asylum and say by just by myself that if you bring a child at least you get a faster track or an easier track not to diminish what they've gone through is that the case if you heard those stories as well\nIt could be the case but I didn't see it when I went to the interview them I don't believe so obviously\nAlways said it would be easier if I brought my kid you know to stay in the United states\nNo no the the main reason is it was from the women that I spoke to was because they want their kids to go to school and that's the main thing they bring them over here because when when they were and what that might not they can't provide sometimes you have to pay to send your kids to a better school\nSo at times they don't even want to send them to a school where it's like they're not going to get the best education that they can get\nTo hear a reporter and I lay lay on is joining us spoke to immigrant families who are dropped off by ice the first congressional church in the valley where are the people that you talk to you today headed are they saying in Arizona or are they are they're leaving\nNow most of them are leaving and they are actually leaving tonight so the man that I spoke to he's headed to Tennessee he's he I think he got his ticket from his brother in law that they're sending him off tonight two of the women are\nActually headed to the east coast where the hurricanes are going on so while I'm One of them is going to South Carolina and the other one is headed to Florida\nSo they actually had their tickets for this week but they had to delay them because of the hurricanes they weren't able to be sent out\nIf they don't have a family member here where do they go\nIf they don't find it on the member I actually don't know what happens to them\nThey probably can stay I Would assume at the church has long of a church can support them I ... or a shelter right around a\nJob start making a little bit of money to do that though with no with no id the

nothing but none of them speak any fluent English\n... speaking to several of these immigrants thank you for joining us yeah thank you so much guys\nSo ice continuing to drop off a immigrants here in the valley a and these people are claiming asylum and so\nBut it's not necessarily for violence I thought it was all about gang related what's what ... found is that there's such abject poverty they don't have they can't provide food they don't have shelter\nWill just keep in mind she talked to a few ... the writer so I don't know if the majority of people are saying it is because of poverty ...
