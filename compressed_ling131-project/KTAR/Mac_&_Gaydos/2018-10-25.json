six hundred seven points the NASDAQ had its worst day since two thousand eleven falling three hundred twenty nine wiping out its gains for the year and the S. and P. gave up eighty five oil prices rose thirty nine cents a barrel to close at sixty six dollars an eight cents\nYou know there may be more of these out here but consistently when you go from John Brennan the former CIA director to George Soros of you know there's a big spender of Democrats to obviously two Democratic presidents it's sort of makes sense that this is somebody that is enraged\nAnd they've got anger and revenge on their mind and it's kind of like I'm going to use force and violence to get people's attention\nIs the way this about attention though I mean what ... instead of taking a gun and trying to shoot somebody we know that a knife is more personal a gun is a little bit more removed one is a pipe bomb say\nIt tells you that he or she has no desire to confront people and my guess is the personality type would be their property introverted angry I suspect people around them and heard them ventilate about what's going on with the quote unquote Democrats\nYour comment about is he aligned with the president my guess is at least on a number of issues he probably is again based on his alleged or as potential victims\nAll that sort of goes into\nMaybe how do you catch this guy\nAnd I think the combination of whatever you can find off the bomb is it a bomb they've seen before where did the bombs going through the mail stream in other words what post office did they go through how does the secret service have in their database of people who have sent\nThreatening communications or or just on their radar for safety reasons or because of all to protect these they have from former to\nCurrent presidents are my guests says he's going to get caught 'cause it just seems that way too and sophisticated for that and not to be the case\nRed berets or just ABC News crime and terror analyst a former up special agent we're talking about bombs being sent to the Clintons the Obamas other Democrats Brett how easy is it to mail a bomb to Bill Clinton or Barack Obama\nIs a meal and it's quite easy\nTo walk to the post office and\nPut whatever postage now you know that's an interesting thing that I just thought of as apparently some of these packages had access postage on it in other words like the guy had played stamps on it and so [laughter] so you know what does that tell you about him you know I don't know what's he trying to avoid maybe walking into a post office will have to see but to go to your point\nFormer presidents have Secret Service details\nAnd literally all of their mail does come to them it goes to an off site and it's great\nIncluding early in the case of the Clintons and the Obamas\nThe offsite caught the bomb ... and it never got any further than that so can you come up with their addresses will that will be easy enough\nOkay to get it in their hands almost impossible\nExactly they all know that we're not going to open anything they get\nSo maybe this guy who wanted to do this knew it wasn't going to get there he's sending the message but also the timing of this were less than two weeks away from the mid term spread that had to go to this right\nI think so I think he is trying to saying send a message that\nThis can happen to you if you think like these folks do\nNow is there and watch it go as that sounds you know is is this behavior going to change your opinion my opinion no but the point being is that he feels like going after people in a very violent way will make a point the big takeaway from this in my view\nIs the word intolerance this sort of goes to just not being tolerant of how other people think and unfortunately that seems to be on the rise in this\nCountry if you're the FBI do you send out some kind of memo or tell law enforcement don't have anybody empower who's a Democrat open their mail what is the level

have been mailed to uh I guess their democratic politicians but also celebrities now celebrities yeah who are Democrats yeah Robert De Niro got one today a Joe Biden got at least I think maybe even today\nThere are a lot of questions surrounding you know this who's the guy did put this out is there one or is there are many other people\nWant to talk about a joining us now is Steve Gomez you've heard them on the show before ABC News security contributor and former FBI special agent Steve how are you today\n[noise] very good thank you for having me on so what we're learning now is that there are characteristics similar characteristics to these devices how would the FBI how do you think the FBI would traced this bomb maker bomb makers when all they have in front of him as a package with an unexploded bombs what do they look at where do they go\nOkay there's a lot of evidence here so there's a lot for the investigators to work with starts with a bomb technicians that are going to be doing very careful forensic analysis of each device\nThey've you know ten ten devices ten packages\nUm you've got the uh you know the analysis going into the actual devices themselves\nThe explosive material or the actual you know the pipe bombs you know it sounds like it's plastic a PVC a you know you've got a timer you you've got all these different pieces of equipment and tools that were used I'm In construction the actual device so there there's a lot there that they are going to be able to\nFigure out as far as that style and the method of the bomb maker that's going to be helpful you got the packages there's a lot that they can glean from those packages as far as potential DNA hair fiber maybe a partial fingerprint any other type of a you know a DNA a identifier that they can get from those packages\nSo again a lot to work with they're\nGoing to be focusing on that there you also then have the fact that these packages were ah you had to return address of uh in in South Florida Debbie Wasserman Schultz has office um and so the assumption I I Believe is that that those packages were placed in the mail system somewhere in South Florida\nIs that that would seem logical and therefore you got to get some resources out there to make sure you cover a lot of leads 'cause there's a lot of work to do down there\nSo the Clintons the Obamas Joe Biden they receive these bombs through the mail amongst other CNN Eric Holder or we're talking to Steve Gomez ABC new security contributor former FBI special special agent see why didn't these bombs go off\nTo a very good question um I think it's something that they are examining right now I think in in the press conference that they had a couple of hours ago they uh they didn't want to talk too much about that I think that was smart um because I think that's part\nOf the investigation into the motive um it ... they are a number of things that play first of all these devices were all sent the people\nThat ... high profile people they all have screening there they're not the kind of people that are going out to their mailbox and and and you know getting their male okay somebody's going to be doing that and and you know in the case of a lot of these you know like\nYou go you know ... you know whatever okay so we know that Burger King has the scary black cherry yet\nWhat will win or what is that scary burger\nNo this

Frank rigs you get the uh you get to stage here first um school resource officers what do you think well\nIt's an absolutely defining issue in our race in a there's a very clear contrast difference between my position and that um as Hoffman's you know I first of all I come at it as a as a former police officer an ex cop who got into education after working with juvenile offenders in at risk students\nBut I Believe that that the a sworn trained uniformed law enforcement officer in the school is a good thing and a proven deterrent unlike my opponent who has said on several occasions now that we should increase SRO Z\nIn our schools because they engage in discriminatory practices and very specifically said they're biased in discriminate\nAgainst students of color in students with disabilities again I take very strong exception to that I think two or three weeks ago last night\nMiss Hoffman in our debate at easy central said well we certainly don't need a police officer leading our schools I actually think that would be a good background to have in addition to my very extensive executive educational and legislative leadership experience\nBut the other thing I Want to say on that is that s arose can can be role models they can be mentors counselors I Know that in my work in schools I you know I meant to hurt a lot of young people are they also have a proven\nPositive
