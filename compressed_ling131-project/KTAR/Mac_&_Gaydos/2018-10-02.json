on with the FBI today the White House came out and said we're not going to limit the scope no matter what they all say we're not going to limit the scope\nOn this we're going to take a look at it in a ... we're going to give them\nAll of the range that they need but only in dealing with these right\nSo the scope is you can ask questions regarding Dr Ford or or the second accuser right you can ask\nQuestions about that the scope those states that it can't be any further we're not going to we're not going to hamstring you or or do any of those things but I took a lot of heat for it and I get it and he said over the weekend if it wasn't for\nIf it wasn't for the fact that he wasn't running again he probably wouldn't be able\nTo do this\nBut he is and that's the politics right he felt somewhere a lot of people I think thought that he changed his mind because of those women he got in his face in the in the elevator I don't think that was it ... from what I'm hearing from people is Susan Collins and Murkowski really really had serious issues and there were a few other people\nThat potentially could vote for or against them that are thinking about for for or against him and didn't feel comfortable we already know who's going to vote for him and he's going to vote against them but these three and there are two other ones that are on the left side of the album they happen to be a lot of sight out in red states\nThat felt like they needed more they absolutely needed more but the question what happens 'cause it's supposed to be a week\nThat is it supposed to be a week what happens if\nWhat are the chances that we are going to be in exactly the same place a week from now\nThere's a chance and we knew the Athens and some colleagues fed them so we back here one week from now it'll be worse than the other outrageous delegations come forward the FBI we'll talk to people who want to talk anymore we won't be any better off\nThere is a chance but that will happen I I Do think that we can make progress\nYeah I think is the chances of the differences is if if you put the investigation into the lane it's supposed to be in the no matter what happens outside of that ... it's it it doesn't matter but it wasn't going to happen\nWasn't going to happen either way it look he wasn't going to be voted in if this wasn't done and I think\nYou're never more than Fifteen

got a victory today I think it'll be a little bit better I Do or what but this was one of those things where Trump will touted as well a lot of other people's even yes a channel do he will touted as well and but you have to ask yourself is is it a big big win\nIt Canada him away with a lot as well do completely intact works for word from the old agreement or something called chapter Nineteen what does that mean it means that Canada and go to an independent\nAnd ... when it happened to you to train dusty if I'm with the United states and does not\nHave to protect south to any kind of view ...

tomorrow I Would suspect they'll change their tune but that's okay\nI mean it's interesting I mean again the whole thing and in itself is very very interesting to see how this thing is going to play itself out at you know I and and I always tell everybody ... you take a deep breath because these things take time and we will see the effect of good or negative not tomorrow\nBut in months and years that's how these things are measured is it a win for Trump\nIt's I'll say this it's another promise it is another promised that he got done and he said he was going to get some of these things done and that's the one thing about Trump the speed at times which he tries to do these things and which these things get done\nIs good oh but there's still a lot of work to be done it still has to have sixty days wants all said and done for it to go to Congress would have been proven so just because of the year doesn't mean it's going to be you and sign so it'll be very very interesting to see how

ABC Fifteen meteorologist\nIrish it's high high I Rosa or has certainly made an impact here huh ah\nCertainly to say the least this one is rare data is I Know you like these where record of that oh yeah and that's exactly what this one is going to go down as so let me try not to no doubt you much here but I mean he wrote a headline that you first and then we'll talk about ... numbers okay now\nToday will go down as the second wedded October day ever do any month of October\nToday to second what October day now overall when looking at every single day and the calendar year today\nWill go down as than nine what if they ever in Phoenix and that's just taking into account the rain that fell at Phoenix that harbor in recent memory\nThe number one what is stay Norbert you remember that we had the flooding along I tend to have the number one spot right so we are behind that but in recent memory today the closest and when it's day again\nThe ninth wedding day ever now so far to we've got to look at the fact that we're just in a date you of October and so far October is going down as a force wedded October ever\nAnd we're just two days in to this is a significant event and when I think that we're going to be talking for quite a long time pressure\nWow man I Am I I mean it's crazy so well and you know\nIf it's the ninth what if they ever in Phoenix set right\nThat is exactly what I said I physically since that since a midnight we've picked up two point five inches of rain so the bulk of this rain with Rosa\nSell overnight and into this morning and that's why we saw that in math on the road this morning and that's why we're still dealing with those flood issues because a lot of that rain coming over and I end up early this morning now so far total or this storm we're talking Sunday rain Monday rain and today's prank call when you add that all up\nWhere it two point six three inches of rainfall\nFor Rosa okay we could still add to that but if you're just comparing that amount to other tropical systems that we dealt with Norbert silk takes the number one spot with three point three inches of rain again that flooding in September of twenty fourteen when we saw that flooding along I ten that's still the number one spot but in\nFourth place Rosa with two point six three inches of rainfall again so far and we could add to that\nTerms of how how big your seat is in terms of inches or you know you're talking from the front to back or with\nI I I was thinking with okay just you know people are getting bigger than that right right so so I think they're gonna they're gonna try and get a couple of more inches on that on the seats the seat with that's just how I see it but\nI mean I don't know it doesn't just that don't do anything for me\nThat just do anything for you it doesn't do anything for a lot of people if you're then you're you're ... right but the but you're tall right so you want more leg room ... between you and the seat ahead of you not going to happen right so\nCongress says will fight for the the leg room I'm not really not really we're still going to get cramped but you know\nYou put it this way what could come out of this whole thing is that\nI don't know a seat is twenty eight inches and they've got to go back to thirty that's like the regulation right regulation seat size so that's all that might happen because when when the story came out a couple of weeks ago that\nCongress was going to fight for our leg room and they were going to take on the big bad to airline and your and your ... the airplanes would have to all look like you know lounges right there on couches everywhere made a bean bag chairs now that's not that I knew that wasn't going to happen and I knew\nWhy didn't get my hopes up because government doesn't solve problems they create problems [laughter] so I knew that this with him on I mean you know I I said this for a long time Congress is really the main problem in Washington it's not whoever the president in is because\nWhoever the president is is gone in for\nMaybe eight years drops right they ... and under ... Thirty years in Congress did you we watched those hearings just last week my goodness everybody's Ninety yeah Ninety right\nSo I never expected them to do Orrin Hatch was at the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearing in Nineteen Ninety One he's still\nSitting member of Congress to hear what happened on that American Airlines flight by the way the which one but one from Phoenix to Boston I think they had to land a party from Phoenix right they departed from Phoenix and they had to make an emergency landing in Kansas City have you ever heard\nOf a plane making the emergency landing because of what this one person was doing never not one time I ever heard this not one time I've ever seen this I didn't know you could do it there was a passenger by the way when he got on the plane when he boarded the plane he was there was a woman with them to dogs\nThat's bad enough you're going to dogs on the plane come on yeah he was stumbling he appeared intoxicated he sat down the order beer and alcohol right\nAnd then he started doing pull ups can you do pull ups on a plane\nIs it above in where the baggage department is is is that where you polar or had\nBeen he started doing pull ups on the overhead bin he had to be drunk or just misses workout [laughter] he had to be\nDrawn so how long it probably has some three or four times a sit down he refused to sit down he got verbally abusive and he threw a dog ... no I Know he did not IT mhm well at least his two dogs are going to be alive because he's on American not you're not\nA right out of it and it's always good when I can get it in a yeah I did I've heard of that so I have\nAre real huh huh All right so uh they had to uh to divert the flight to Kansas City right about Ninety minutes after take off\nI wouldn't want a guy doing pull ups on the baggage compartment and they only have\nA bad idea I think that would be a really bad idea All right coming up at four o'clock we are going to lose control of the show okay it's not our show anymore and if you don't know what that means you probably should turn into\nAt four o'clock four oh five but coming up next Kavanaugh's third accuser she speaks out is she credible issue as credible as Dr Christine for next\nHuge\n\nRochelle brings record ring falls to the valley paid out what their message boards up on the freeway say rain\nFlashing slow down\nOh how funny and drivers hide your plane is there still flake and there's plenty of my record breaking the base of rain fell in the valley we've had more than two ... two inches of rain at Harvard that make the point why does over I think\nArizona's breaking news traffic and whether he's KBA our news not Egypt we have him and that Katie a our news\nNothing like Arizona water oh sent smells we're doesn't it the odd taste yeah like there's all these floating in it and you're you're looking at it and you're thinking how in the world can I drink that Islam\nYou don't ever have to drink that slap anymore or you have to do is call Connecticut Tom ... and uh they'll give you a free and home consultation Connecticut water consultants nobody better these guys came to my house ten years ago they tested my water they looked at my plumbing and they recommend recommended a system\nAnd I remember when they tested by water and they showed it to me\nAnd I mean you could see all the weird stuff in it\nAnd they said gain does your water is drinkable barely and I'm thinking why would I Want to put something so unhealthy and my body I don't want to do that so do what I did ten years ago call Connecticut mentioned gate us you get a free and home consultation\nOr in Connecticut will recommend a system that works for you and your family six to nine one oh six five seven oh Connecticut ...\nThinking about selling your home why pay tens of thousands of dollars in commission fees if you don't have to let me tell you about Farah a real estate company that's now here in Phoenix bills here come on tell us more\nThanks you know most people don't believe it but fair is actually free for sellers instead of paying six percent are selling your home for thousands below market value you keep your equity and not the most money when you sell with Farah we've already said Tom sellers over ten million dollars really harsh fair work\nThere and takes care of all the services you need to market your home including an MLS lifting professional photos signs lock box and more completely free offers are made on line with fear and even buyers with\nOut agents can make an offer which means more offers and more money for ourselves so I use Farah for free but what if I Want an agent some of our clients do want an agent to manager sale and we have experienced agents that work for you for just one percent\nWow thanks bill list for free with Farah are getting ... to one percent learn more at Farah dot com today Farah dot com that's S.
