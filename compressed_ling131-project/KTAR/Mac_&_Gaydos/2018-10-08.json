against they'll become this hour that came commando show but the phone lines are open one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty for once again is the way to join us and when you're calling again there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commando show man cave no Kim though there Andrew\nSo Scott in Charleston South Carolina called him and he said I just got back from months in Europe and Russia and we're worried about Internet Security and ice and Scott you just got back\nShouldn't have been the hall humane foreign your way\nJust you know it's a little heads up Scott [laughter] next time give us a call before you go [laughter] I mean he said yes I should do but we're planning on going back and it got me thinking next time we go to Russia how can we prepare ourselves to be secure\nOK so a friend of mine who lives in London has been eager to go okay is that um she was telling me that she went to Beijing\nAnd so she had her windows laptop they're connected to the hotel why fight right [laughter] okay [laughter] and she said all of a sudden the the hard drive light like when okay and it stayed constantly illuminated for the next eight hours\nWonder why don't you think\nThere were copying the entire hard drive not the Chinese oh they would not do that at all gosh God neither what the Russians worried about\n[noise] well I Would love to adopt the talk to you before we called\nBut that was the option and in fact I have a kind of a two part question number one there's always been ours devices or less vulnerable than Android or PCs now if you just first confirmed that then I Want to talk about the peons\nUm [noise] the reason why that people say that I owe us devices are more secure is that there are ... that apple\nAnd that that apple keeps a hold on everything okay so in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break an iPhone if you want him to and basically take all the security and the trolls and right away\nBut if you are trying to get a piece of malware onto an Iowa this device that it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] [noise] well what I did do [noise] sorry on this trip was caught a little bit of a cold do us a it's a VPN but I wondered if that was enough or if there was more the U.S should be doing in a situation of [noise] what\nDid you do everything while you were overseas I mean did your bank can pay your credit cards and check Facebook in business and stuff like that\nI did have to check my bank once or maybe twice but I Try to avoid that didn't do anything with credit cards except Oakland obviously to deal with the ... uh it was mainly just to tricky meal\nAnd then did you do everything through the VPN or did you fall like uh where where you got like well just go and check the mail ones\n[noise] it wasn't so much that is there were several types it seemed like the the Pew prohibited me from getting on a website and I don't mean that particular website ... just like anything getting on the Internet peers\nAnd it could do that depending upon what locked downs can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of VPN when if you look at their coverage maps and that you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in my email this past week I also had a note from a gentleman who was in China and couldn't go anywhere because he was in China you know of course they didn't have the great firewall there\nAnd they're stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic when you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is that you make a complete backup of everything\nA so that this way if you need to restore it then you'd be able to because sometimes coming back in the country are going to a country believe it or not that you may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad uh three or six months you might be able to see it again but quite possibly a year and nobody wants that to happen so that was not your issue I Would recommend that you change all your passwords to any account that that you have had access to\nA especially your even though you didn't use a VPN because I wouldn't want you to take any unnecessary risks and then be sitting here thirty days after a trip and typically they're going to wait until you you're at home for thirty days and then you start seeing some weird stuff happening you know what I mean\nUm and if you haven't already set up some type of authentication on your bank account I Would definitely encourage that but in my wallet I carry a\nAbout the size of a thumb drive I don't know if you've ever seen the news and the some Dr has a rotating code on it even now I can tell you I can show you that there's a code on it and every thirty seconds I get a brand new code if you don't have that code you can't have access to my bank account so I Would try to\n... I Would encourage you to see if you can still some of that type of\nA extra layers of protection as well and they sent me for you though because it's called we're here for you um but congratulations on a great trip at a safe return but again just spend some time and change all those passwords and listen I have to tell you if you haven't heard about the brand new commando ambassador ... super

V. yes it's the fourth season going on right now in another episode is coming up\nSunday night nine o'clock eastern six o'clock Pacific you're going to find out what team black\nIs thinking about the first three episodes of the show so far All right it's time to check in with Boston and talk to my good friend David Allan Lambert the chiefs genealogist of the New England historic Jimmy logical citing American ancestors dot org how's it going David\n... things and being town looking good especially far Red Sox\nYes they are aren't they think it's going to be a fun season for the playoffs in ... where do we start with their family he store news today my friend\nWhile I get a real quick when you know I had a console today with my cousin and didn't know it was my cousin until after the conflict but our fourth great grandfather and ... or ... or I Lived in the same town\nThe first time we've seen each other and two hundred years I chose that would go\nMy first story for family is runners is in ... in Germany or a roofer working on a twelve century cathedral founded on message at a bottle and not on a beach but the ironic twist to this fish is it wasn't no west by his grandfather eighty ears are\nHow [laughter]\nI Love this\nPeter Brand got this note out of the bottle left by his Eighteen year old grandfather back in Nineteen thirty willy Brandt talking about the despair after World War one and Germany and wrote quote we hope for better time to come well world war two incomes you know I don't know if that would have better times\nI don't think so but what an amazing thing I mean he had looked at this and go no this this can't be but they're both in the roofing business and he knew his grandfather and I guess they overlapped a little bit and and eventually took over the family business it's been going on for for decades\nFor for decades create little time capsule yeah our next\nStory talks about the consequences of war and disease World War one of course many of us have ancestors were part of that and many of our ancestors had influenza\nJust by reading ... and they were so many people do script with somebody that you wouldn't have asleep if you read them all you have to kind of the limit yourself to the most current thinks they're coming in and\nAnd you'll learn who at the top posters that really are doing groundbreaking tools that will help you to learn to do it faster\nSo that is how I learned I then I started going to conferences to buy for duty in San Diego with the the and the Institute for genetics and the allergy and so once I was there again you find out people who have been doing it a lot longer than I have how they go about this and and what works and what does it\nWell let's go through that process who you mentioned that you saw just listen listen opportunities basically to help people it is it that there's one person that goes in and works with the individual who posted their to their case or might several people being they're working on it\nIt could be several people for for my part I don't usually get up too much with helping people who are on the boards just because I have so many people here locally and people that are actually related to anything in my DNA natural to need help\nAnd so I have a backlog eye I saw dozens of cases but there are also other ones that are in various stages waiting for that has to come in or target testing people to to solve the puzzle\nSo I don't have time really to offer too much to help in the group I Will answer questions but to specifically help somebody that's not my area that makes sense\nYeah you're you're talking about working with people you know or do you watch them referred to locally I get that but you have a nice thing about this is is it does mean there's opportunity for anybody to serve somebody else from anywhere you know from a little mountain in Kentucky to somewhere in Russia doesn't make it happen as a hostile to\nCollaborate with ... and other states and I never met them ... percent that we tried to each other's work and we know how to work together\nDo you find that there are there people with special to use that you lack or vice versa where where you have that collaboration ongoing\nYes um when I was helping somebody who had Hawaiian heritage and Filipino heritage I found out about it give me an out part of the island for that I had no idea how extreme it was\nAnd so someone that you need to talk to ... had oh karate okay and so then you find out who the special if there is in that area and find out more about it play in the next step same thing with the court to do a thorough violence I had an adoptees who fathers mine came from that from the violence\nAnd so I'm Catherine was instrumental in helping me figure that out because ... Portuguese a source of islands and honestly when I went to her class at first I foresee the in San Diego a couple of years ago\nI thought this has nothing to do with me I don't know exactly why I'm here and then it wasn't that a couple of months later that I met this adoptee who needed that specific health and so I was able to know who to reach out to\nIsn't that interesting and that's really true I I think a lot of people look to many of us who've been doing this for a long long time as the ... of all things in the world [laughter] and the reality is that nobody can know everything\nAbout genealogy whether it's you know when you compare New York city record say to record somewhere in Montana or to some place in in the Netherlands I mean they're very different\nAnd you have to have people who know the territory and the same really applies in genetics as well and ... has got to be a real problem for those who aren't familiar with the term it means basically\nYou share many of these same ancestors among your family in other words maybe your father and your mother are second or third cousins going back now are a lot of\nCousins and your ancestry married and they are married and yeah so everybody's kind of interconnected more than you would expect\nYeah and that makes the problem because then as you try to figure out what your relationship might be to somebody else you might have a little too much and have to kind of short all that out how do you go about some of those tasks of sorting out in dog can be cases mckell\nFor starting them out but he looked at the ... matches and try to make categories and a lot of it I Can't do in in my head I don't know if they see more and said that she goes out to eat these white or two and different spreadsheets and sometimes the charts and things like that\nThere are other neutral effect elites color cluster method so it's partly just being able to have that are hung on the way the outline must go with this line even though there is a dog and they you know you see a connection between the family right in the right generation\nAnd then partly just doing the groundwork a lot of these kids take time if you don't have a super close match like\nIt's a first cousin or an aunt or uncle or grandparents you know there's not much work to do on a case like that that if you have like a second or third or ... closest match then it can take some time for the week days weeks months of work to count on that case sure they're not always quickly called\nRight exactly and it's really very similar process to what they're doing with some of the criminal cases right now mhm undermines your cases involved with adoptees or is it just people trying to break through their lines\nAlmost all adoptees and maybe about half and half witness attributed parentage people who grew up thinking their father or the grandfather with one person and that but they do their DNA results they have access to those live yeah and find out that their biological I this is in a different mind and that can be devastating that you can imagine because\nPeople are very tied into their heritage part of the in the search angel is learning how to have that connection to be able to be part social worker and help people feel better if they find someone was a criminal and then I had a close relative or something\nYou have to just let them know that doesn't define their heritage\nHey we all got all by now you've all gotta mckell right so when you get into this as you as you progress with is what are you finding is the most fulfilling for you\nThen the case is solved and you're able to walk somebody through their tree a little bit and show them what has been found time and time again they just still so relieved just to have that closure just to know the course of their life even if they don't want contact her desire contact or the or the other parties don't desire clock out\nIt's not always about contact and about reunions\nAnd so just to see photos of people that you biologically descend from is very fulfilling to most people\nYes so if somebody wanted to become a search angel how would you recommend they get the proper training not only in the process but in this counseling side of it that often comes with it\nI Would start on those two Facebook pages either DNA detective and or genetic geology tips of techniques and just read up on some of the post and spend at least some time everyday on down and see what's being discussed\nBecause that doesn't cost anybody at all and you can see it that something you really want to\nGo to conferences takes time and investment of money that the court and if you can't do it but I think that there are other ways when I started there was no blueprint like here to tell you the answer changes you know right and so what I'm doing now with small groups or change will training and working on writing a book for search angel\nIs to try to fill that gap for people that are starting out and realizing they have a pastor after this\nCan have someplace to go and do what the next steps are just to try to say get tied up possibly making some mistakes along the way short with either occasionally at Thirteen so he'll have a hypothesis that it might not be the right way to start with but you have to get to where you're certain that you have the the tree correct so that you're not spread didn't need that information\nFor that to a huge responsibility you're absolutely right actually interest\nPossibility you know we do this with volunteers but you also have to have safeguards and be able to follow best practices\nSure absolutely she's ... from Tempe, Arizona thanks so much for sharing all your information about it I think it's going to be useful to a lot of people\nLike them and coming up next I'm going to talk to a guy I got to know at the F G s conference in Indiana in August\nHis name is Rick void and he is one of the co founders for a company called

oh so are you\nHey John we got elections are common were just a couple of weeks away and I don't know if you've noticed this but\nUm I was watching the cardinals game yesterday [laughter] we don't have to get into how ugly the wind was at least it's a win but I was watching it and I was thinking what what what is more debilitating to me the cardinals play or all of the political ads\n[laughter]\nListen a carry and I have become connoisseurs of political ads because we are a captive audience while you guys can turn it down shut it off and change the channel\nWe're in the studio like hostages change that we've got to endure this onslaught I've made a joke to carry I said Fox News anchors Martha\nExcel and care students cinema you know we would it feels\nLike I Know we talked to mix Sally last week in Studio about these ads and you know the bank to to add in a you know we're still waiting to hear from Pearson sending those people about coming on the show I don't know what they're waiting for but\nI'll tell you what it's been really hard to get her um she used to come on my Sunday show all the time cannot get her to come on it's it's really been tough why is that I think it is such a tight race it's within the margin of error um it is literally a toss up\nThat I think none of these folks want to make a mistake and there are so freaked out about making a blender down the stretch that they don't want to be in an environment where they're going to get questions for thirty minutes they just don't want to do it\nThat's cowardly you're running your you put it this way John\nDemocracies served when everybody's playing it safe and play a rope a dope I don't like it\nYeah ... or you're working for us\nYeah they they forget that and you know what listen I I think we'll have cinema here in Studio I think you'll probably do it we're still trying ... already came in and face the tough questions or I Know and I agree with you I think it does people disservice listen if you're running for Senate and you don't want to do an interview tough you better do we you know and the\nSad part about it is is I think I think you're still send them as being ill advised on this because I Want it for a really great qualities is her charm and that is not on display when she's kind of cloistered and not out there in front of the public I think she should be out there are more not less\nI was surprised I read the other day that she wouldn't even answer questions after some kind of public appearance and I'm thinking to myself oh my goodness I you know I've only met her maybe you know two or three times\nShe goes and talks to people I mean this is not who she is she usually like you said is very you know sure I'll come on the show sure I'll talk about this\nStuff to hear ago it just they shut it down when they started running the ads that was kind of I Would call it an image campaign for her that that was kind of I think to to bolster the idea that she is a moderate which are voting record does suggest hum in Congress\nNow her detractors say that her voting records very carefully crafted that that she's right in the middle because of the number\nBut in the middle because of the number of votes she's taken and on the little stuff she's voted with Republicans but on the big stuff say tax cuts she voted against the tax cut she voted with Democrats and the tax cuts on Kavanaugh\nI'm In the end it took it was pulling teeth for both of them to get them to finally steak an opinion and in the end um mix Sally said she would have voted to confirm Kavanaugh and cinnamon said she would have voted against\nSo ah American Airlines is telling employees a to think twice before re booking stranded customers on rival airline oh I hate this\nSo we give me a scenario where we're we're this is going to tick me off okay so you and your wife let's say you fly to Hawaii are we in first class a ... that they know that you are you okay All right All right or not you know I don't want to kill my dog\nHold Ansari let's say you and your wife go to Atlanta see Cassie an Eli, Eli ... my nieces yes okay but flying back there is of delay or there's a mechanical problem with American Airlines All right now they could put you on southwest\nWell that's the nice thing to do because they screwed up but they don't okay what do they do\nThey delay you a day to get you on another American flight so you have to spend an extra day\nIn Atlanta maybe at a hotel or whatever but you don't get home in time because American this is what happens with real answers realtors do this to ... to do this sometimes to they don't show you all the houses they show you the houses they want you to see where you don't know if the houses that you know you might really like\nBut they don't want you to see them because it's not part of their realty group\nThis is hiding the fact that you couldn't get home in ... you know it's the same day or within the number of hours of fan and I was on another airline but they don't give you the choice because they say nope don't consider it I hate this I don't like it either because which means you have\nTo then go on your cell phone in an airport and find your own way back if you want to fly different airline\nI just think if an airline makes a mistake or if an airline is delayed\nTheir job is still to get you from point a very ... in the most expeditious manner and usually you know I I I haven't had to do this a lot but uh but I can remember saying these words give me a different airlines find me a different scene\nAnd you'll have to do that some people will assume well American will find me any airline but they won't do it yeah if they're the only airline son doing this well it's a new policy why are they why did they decide to do this\nThat's a great question it's got to be to save money it's about the bottom line I was a great question maybe it's to keep the money in South wet or I'm Sorry I Americans pocket maybe a cost\nAirlines money to put you on another airline I mean that's that's what it has to be and they don't want to do that they are I mean they are the Scrooge is of screwed right I mean it's true okay so\nSo by contrast American told agents to help the airlines best customers the frequent flyers the guys are the ladies who fly first class all the time that get to get them to their destinations quickly put them on another airline but if you're flying economy and forget it\nI mean that's just it's a bottom line is you want to serve the customer but as you pointed out that they don't want to do that\nSo if you're if you're a frequent flier with American Airlines and your flight is delayed they will put you on another airline to get you to your desk or like me or you are most of you out there you fly occasionally you're screwed\nKind of sort of unless like you say you demand\nThat you need to be there for a funeral or a wedding or early ... there's a times sensitivity issue like hey I'm going to miss my daughter's graduation I Need to get there doesn't mean they're going to do it I mean by going to be going to have to jump up and down or maybe right to go on your on cell phone and you're going to have to find another airline\nOr you could just go on Twitter and shame them because unfortunately they listen to that that could be really sad that we have to do that because that's not something I'd like to do I don't like to say ... ... ... you know hey give me a break here or well I don't like to go on social media and complain about\nAn

Howard air with replace repair call how we're there and document on Arizona's ... station ...\nArizona is an afternoon news when back in ... so we\nFor a big story what\nPresident Trump says Democrats are going to face a political ... in the November midterm elections because of their opposition to ... from how they handle the allegation made against him the president spoke to reporters before leaving the White House for Florida now\nFrom many people I think it is still the American\nAnd I think you see a lot of things\nWell Trump is hosting a ceremonial swearing in for Brett Kavanaugh as we speak and yes\nNow there are reports that the Democrats want to impeach red cabinet yeah our first of all how in the world\nCould they do that because it is a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nGreat question first ... yes the Democrats the Democrats would have to win the house and the Senate okay so they have to win both branches okay and remember that for later\nThan they would start an investigation the house which started investigation now what exactly constitutes some kind of charge that would fit the definition of a high crime misdemeanor nobody really knows what that would be it could go all the way back to the Bush administration\nSaying sexual misconduct they're saying are the questions that he answered a before the Senate during the recent hearings and they're also saying what you said a claiming maybe that Kavanaugh during the Bush administration lied under oath right about receiving stolen memos alright try and get him on that\nSo whatever the charges the house would then vote on them to impeach all that's required as a simple majority and so the house would say here's what we have let's move forward then the Senate because again the Senate if their democratic controlled they will be brought before the ... the charges would be brought before the Senate which has given the sole power to impeach\nAnd that's why you need the Democrats to be in charge because if they brought it to the Senate and it's you know Republican controlled he's not going anywhere it is um\nIs it likely are unlikely\nEven if the Democrats take the house you need sixty seven votes and the United States Senate to convict someone in an impeachment trial and remove them from office justice Kavanaugh is secure and his seat as far as one can see for his lifetime appointment\nI think it's over unless he does something while on the bench that is agree just write something comes out or maybe another person comes forward with an an accusation and they can confirm it\nI don't see ... the impeachment process it's only happened once to a Supreme Court justice and that was in the Eighteen hundreds and the guy was ... nuts he was just out of his mind\nIf you're the Democrats you got to start thinking about twenty\nSo you got to start thinking about twenty twenty I you know you you know there there comes a point where you've lost a battle you don't have to like it but\nBrett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court justice but it's the battles on who delay and get Trump out of office then using the cabin on investigations and can't get out of office\nThe people can get Trump out of office and we talked about it before you know as as horrible as some of the things he says if he's got a good economy he may get another four years so I don't I don't know I I don't find I don't think the Democrats have a prayer to get Kavanaugh off\nAre really your seatbelt and limousine usually not I would think having a good time you're usually not thinking about safety uh the the the rows of seats are very different uh ...\nIt's just a ... it's just a horrific shame that somehow and and the residents around this area said that intersection has had problems for years and and they don't know how to fix it\nUh one person who was killed a while inside the limo sent a text message complaining about the condition of the limo\nAnd apparently was while it was driving out there or before yeah because they weren't supposed to take this limbo it was a last minute replacement after or a bus they hired to shuttle group broke down Mm wow the bus broke down they got into this limousine yeah all of their lives and it\nIs unbelievable yeah twenty people and it wasn't a car crash it into another car well wasn't an oncoming ongoing an oncoming current ... smashed into an oncoming car it was one limousine hitting I guess a parked SUV right I've never heard anything like it I haven't either people\nYou're listening to the big four four four big blockbuster stories to start to four o'clock hour [noise]\nBob being for for the story for\nIs telling employees to think twice before\nRevoking customers whose flights are delayed or cancel on rival airlines and instead to wait for the on another American flight no matter how long it might take that could mean significantly\nIncreased wait times especially for those flying economy the new policy does make exceptions for passengers traveling to weddings and funerals or with those who might be stranded overnight with no hotel room\nYeah uh what I say is I I've got a wedding to go to even though I don't or at a funeral to go to and I don't for our got a I've got a funeral or go to it's yours if you don't get me a lot on another airline how many times in your life has this happened a couple of times to me where\nOne way or another your delayed the plane is something wrong with the plane or it's later and you say to the airline I booked me on another airline right I don't care what you have to do but make it happen make it happen and get me outta here\nWell now the new policy at American says if you're an economy if you were trying to re book it's an economy passenger\nThey will not put you on a competing airline they will however if you're a frequent traveler fly first class a lot they will accommodate you but for the everyday average guy or woman right they're not going to work with you you probably have to look at yourself\nPut it this way if American if I was taking an American airlines flight and for one reason or another it was delayed\nMaybe you know they may be that planes not taken off today right mechanical issue and I say you gotta give be another airline and not going to put you on the west or anything else you need to give me an an another airline and they do it\nYou don't want really liking not necessarily the other airline unlike in at American Airlines yes helped me get from point a to point B it doesn't matter how ... it doesn't matter to me which\nUh airline I fight ... except the United ... I don't want to be on United\nI don't know how this makes American Airlines look good it does look customer friendly when they're telling people don't put them on another airline and I would think that you would want the ... you would want the customer to have a good experience like you said hey wait a go American for getting me home even though it's on another airline\nThis is just to me it's basic it's basic common courtesy now they're telling their their gate agents\nDon't poke 'em on another ... another airline so so if that happens in um stranded somewhere they're going to pay for my hotel are they going to pay for my meals 'cause they should they should be okay but I don't know what what's what's what cost them less money\nPutting me on another airline to give me how I Would think so or you pay for my hotel in my meals I Would think that with a former think I Would think putting you on another airline would be a little bit easy I Would think so too\nWell American Airlines they're going to avoid putting delayed travelers on rival flights just failing or nothing yeah why were you doing anybody any worse now\nAnd the big four at four\nMegan gay couples get them for a for deliver to your phone subscribe to the ...\nWe're both subscribe to the back and gave those five cashed on Google music or the apple pod cast that\nThe elections just a couple of weeks away now do you do see a studio at five Fifteen coming up next Mac and I spent some time with our kids yes one of us said he was in hell this weekend which one of us was it next [noise] [laughter]\nAnd\nWe were Arizona's first radio station [noise]\nBeginning are joining with an a and broadcast nearly one hundred years ago\nFast forward to present day and Casey are the radio station is not just a radio station [noise]\nIt's a news talking information resource that you can connect with from the dashboard of your car from an app on your phone on your computer and also on your smart speaker [noise]\nWhether your smart speaker response to Alexa Google or Siri\nAsk you to placate T.
