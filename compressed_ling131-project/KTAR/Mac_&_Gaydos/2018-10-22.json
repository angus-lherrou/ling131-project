laptop\nOr even my eye pad and iPhone right [noise] yeah so um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do a selfie check to see you know if the lighting is okay maybe the background the position that the camera\nI Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen writing things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before you actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on ya okay and in Chicago you have sunny days you have cloudy days right yes and you have cold winter days I've been there and like a good ... so I'm the best case scenario\nIs that you get what's called a ring light I don't know if you've heard of this and it's a it is a rank and\nI can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com and so what does it has it's for a facial ... like portrait that people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a webcam\nIs that you have a tendency to be washed out okay with the ring light is it exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face K.\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lot of people say oh no I live better in a dark restaurant\nNot not so much K now when you're faces illuminated what's in the background will appear darker OK okay\nAnd so you being a doctor I Would want to see your credentials on the wall meaning I I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them I Want to see\nAll your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'm not gonna be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as that person but you know we've interviewed people before like\nThis guy you know for jobs here and you know and you look and they have this like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like ooh what is that pile that has to write the weekly and all that up\nNow there are ways when you have face time for example that you can hit a button this was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just record say a couple of seconds and then you don't have to worry about just taking pictures of you know record some video of yourself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize body is that you want to smile OK\nOkay and because when you smile you look welcoming\nAnd I'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know have a because there's a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors and I I hear a lot of the bad story but I also here are the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality comes through have you ever done this before\n[noise] uh only on Web in ours but not actually as a patient doctor thing\nThis is so cool I'm so excited frail um the ring lights are about sixty bucks okay and it makes\nLike I said it makes total difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes a little extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this ... and again thank you for your call\nHey speaking of let's talk about their or works relieved like many

target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you wouldn't but a bad but at ... okay but\nSometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat it's I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThe ten percent like eight hundred dollars or something and they had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right\nOne was once and for all you Android people and the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone tip jars like overflowing [laughter] and\nThe Android One didn't have anything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks\nChip here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before giving people out of their money but how about this one this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like let's just get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants right a bunch of barbecue\nAnd I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on a twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you yeah\nAnd you know door dashes and tore us for that and also who breach because they'll say like pricing search okay and so they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever maybe\nBut maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life\nI actually will tip the whole foods\nOr the Amazon Prime driver or whatever it is\nI'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods and delivery yesterday and it was probably I think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nSo you got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter]\nWhich is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars\nCame and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them an extra four\nOr five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there that this works otherwise the absolute are doing this the squares and stuff like that they wouldn't include it\nWell and because you know let's remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right\nOkay so if they can get that tone and thinking about that so they can get the total\nAmount up by five dollars I Would think the tip of the dollar is no no no you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction then you have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that and ...\nLine transaction then you have to pay a fee\nFor them collecting the money and doing things like that and he does have a minute I'm Still not tipping well it is hard it is hard and you know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are it was maybe about uh the I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin\nSo here's ten percent I'm just instead of having an afternoon limited use use the cash that you're expecting me to get him to like my ... something like that [noise]\nAll right let me tell you something over the years epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean you have to experience the economical Epps an ego tank forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner loved his friend is my printer choice\nA for a couple of reasons well first of all is cartridge free don't you hate\nBuying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway gold no it's colored IQ but the epson ego tank forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with up to two years of vague riding the bucks that's enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages\nThat the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that's now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge sets she had to do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars\nWas ego take you easily refill the printers ... tank and ... seconds\nThey go take a Compaq space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot com slash eco tank Kim that's each CEO she a and take him and for a limited time between now and November first you're going to get free overnight shipping whenever you use the promote ego tank came a check out when you buy any ego tank printer so whenever I talk\nAbout his friend and people are always sending me emails you know what was the model number or how can I learned more about it\nDid you really say cartridge free with up to two years of big right in the box yes I said all that here's the Web address as an dot com slash ego tank Kim once again that's epson dot com slash ego tank Kim [noise]\nAll right we have a letter from our listener mail or we're going to be answering this hour it's all about anonymous browsing and there's a browser out there by the name of toward T.

had to actually see you in front of me yes it doesn't happen that often which is why we're going to do a bonus segment here a little bit later I'm with you I Am glad I walked in pick that brain of yours but right now let's get on with our family he used to our news we got a lot of good stories today to share\nRelating the family history starting whether\nThe greatest of all times Muhammad Ali\nThis is going to knock you out I'll tell you the genie a logical world has just learnt that great Muhammad Ali is actually the third great grandson of archer Alexander who was one of these people from history you probably wouldn't know about but he is actually the model for the emancipation statue in Washington DC yeah\nWith Lincoln ... on that yes it's somewhat controversial because it it shows Lincoln towering over\nThis slave being you know lifted to freedom but nonetheless he was the guy and that's the third great grandfather Mohammed Ali and it was discovered because one of ... third cousins did DNA and to work and figured it all out what a great story it's\nIt's unbelievable the history that we find when we don't even think we're going to come across it and of course you know I just hope that none of my third cousins find any interesting stuff that I don't discover right [laughter] hey by the we didn't you meet Muhammad Ali a couple of\nTimes you actually four times I got to meet him and and every single time just a delight with anybody he ... he loves kids he was pleasant he was fine he enjoyed himself and it didn't matter how much people were pressing on him are demanding whatever it was he was just one of the nicest people I've ever met and I've met a lot of celebrities\nSo what does he do he takes the family Bible to the local pets in office that pension officer makes this beautiful transcript of the family record and they have a nice\nNotary signature on it you know it's all nice and official but in that pension file it mentioned the twelfth the child and the\nChild of a little boy named William only lived a few days but he was born and he died that Twain censor says and both for Ohio was keeping civil birth and death records\nSo now you have hopefully completed the family\nYeah it's complete as far as that family Bible appears to be and from what other records I have found but I just thought it was fascinating that out of the three brothers and they're\nVery robust civil war pension files only one of them had this family Bible and it was only in that family Bible that list that that other brother of theirs who sadly died and infancy\nAnd this is why it's so important to look at those siblings I had a similar thing back in Nineteen sixty eight my mother approached my dad's aunt who would have been a check as she was my great aunt\nAnd she provided all kinds of little family history notes from her memory\nThat proved over the decades to be very useful and she sent him just a few months before she died and she had mentioned in there the married name of his sister of my great great grandmother who had been a brick wall for decades\nWhen I started to work on this side of it figure boy if I could find out about this sister in fact I stumbled upon a record that mentioned the name saloon\nIn a record that also contain my great great grandmother and going wait a minute that was the name and aunt ... notes so I started tracking this woman\nAnd then found that the sister and from a result of that she lived longer than my great great grandmother to a point where the death certificate started carrying the names of the parents in New York City so when my great great grandmother died in Brooklyn and Eighteen Seventy nine there was no such place for the names of the parents\nBut by Nineteen hundred there were and so the gave the name of the sisters parents which of course where the parents of my second great grandmother\nAnd when I found the ... of the sister I got the maiden name of the mother and then was able to find all the children that were Christian including my own second great grandmother so\nThat took me back not only that generation but also one more generation to the parents of my great great grandmother mother so it was really useful to find\nIt's also one more generation to the parents of my great great grandmother mother so it was really useful to find the sister and not just work on the direct line\nExactly because each child in the family has the potential of\nCreating records that are going to give us the answers that we're looking for like like you said that one sibling who last long enough to live into an era where they have really good death records and gave you that clue that you needed to move back another generation but if you had focused\nSolely on your direct ancestor you might still be\nBeating your head against that brick wall I think you're right just went back over to London and and it was just very difficult it's always hard to to cross the pond I think\nYeah and when you do have a situation where you're wanting to cross the pawn you need to do as much research as you can on the side yeah\nAnd that includes researching that extended family because you're going to need all of the clues that you can can make sure that you're researching the right person over and the other country and not just someone with the same name\nBoy I think you hit it right on the head and you know Amy one of the other side of researching the siblings is the fact that sibling stories often have to do with your direct ancestors who if you find some distant cousins that might have some oral history or some stories and their lines you could discover some stories in their concerning your people\nDirectly which I think would be really important\nOh definitely and I think sometimes when we're thinking about doing an oral history or you know just talking to someone in the family you know we hear the advice often and it is good advice to approach that people in the oldest generation you know if you're fortunate enough to have somebody\nIn a generation further back than you are\nBut sometimes I think we get so focused on generation being that direct ancestor like well you know my my grand my grandmother is and still living so I Can't interview her but could I interview her sister who is still living sure you know could I interview her brother\nAnd I think we also need to expand it a little bit thinking about like you said thinking about those cousins I'm actually the youngest of twelve grandchildren and my older cousins have completely different memories of\nOur grandparents than what I have sure grandpa died when I had just turned six so I have just a precious few memories of him but in talking to my cousins\nYou know I hear the story about how every year he dressed up as Santa Claus\nAnd hear the stories of what he would do around the house and just how jovial he was like oh you know kind of makes me a little sad that I didn't get to know him better\nBut I think we need to pull out some of those stories from people even within our own generation but who have a different perspective on things that that we have and things that we've experienced because no two people are going to see the event exactly the same right\nAnd especially generational right I mean a child that looks at an adult are completely different way than say a sibling or appear or a friend because they experienced them as adults obviously and have that adult like relationships with people of different around children and it's it's fun to hear how they were in their different roles within life\nRight and I think it's so neat if you can find someone who knew your ancestor younger than you remember that yeah you know I I look at pictures of my dad and it's like wow dad\nOr you know where you were younger than you had [laughter]\nAnd talking to people who knew him when he was in high school or when he was just starting his business it's\nSomething that obviously I Would never be able to experience firsthand and sometimes you know even though I can still ask dad different things that's interesting to get someone else's perspective\nRonald shooting and the other side of this is a good dad doesn't necessarily remember all these other things you know how it goes everybody has the collective piece of memory somewhere but you're not really what we're getting down to here is that no person is an island\nAnd they have experiences essentially in relating or having experiences with other people and when you can find those people who can share those memories you can get some just golden stories and it's really fun also when they disagree [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] totally and\nYou get together with my two sisters and we started talking I was like well now here's what happened now this is how it\nHappened in the third one yeah\nTrying to figure out okay which one of these really is correct and usually it's a little bit\nThe third one yeah at trying to figure out okay which one of these really is correct\nAnd usually it's a little bit out of each one because as you said we all have a different perspective on things and we all have different memories how we remember thanks what was important to us at the time can also affect how we remember it\nAnd you never know what you're going to come up with when you start getting sideways with your family and work on those sibling lines and find their stories and also find their records great stuff Amy thanks so much thank you\nShe's Amy Johnson crow you can follow her at Amy Johnson crow dot com watch to think about their and coming up next to have you ever wondered how your ancestors did coming across the ocean what were the stories they

bit earlier about getting sideways with your family interviewing siblings and aunts and uncles not your directs themselves maybe they're gone but a lot of those stories will live with those people\nTrue and you have to preserve this we have such great technology now\nAnd the records of the ships in the military ships and their photographs to I Know ancestry has a lot of the photographs of the ships that brought our ancestors\nThere is is a great book that's still in print called ships of our ancestry you can use something as simple as we can ... you just put in the name of the vessel I mean you may find that there are more than one vessel over the years with the same name as your ship I mean how many may flowers have there been right I mean so that's the type of thing you can find an image of it or if you have an elderly relatives\nAnd you know that they're the one that came over even as a child get the story and pass it on you know and it it's so important it's something that once these stories are lost their last forever\nThat's it and you know I think a lot of people it's amazing to me because I've always embrace these stories\nIt's amazing to me how many of these stories are lost you know the ... the thing I often hear from people when I talk to them as oh I Wish I had asked that question oh I Wish I had known at that time you know what how much I Would miss this but you grow into it\nAll right I mean even as a child when I interviewed my grandmother who is alive till I was eleven I mean I asked the birth of marriage and death questions what field into a chart heard other stories like the one about her dad beyond the whaling ship so that's kind of a vessel story in its own right\nBut I don't have any of the specifics but you don't know what her parents did or did not tell her sure so sometimes it's lost a generation before the one that you're interviewing yeah\nThere's so many what other sources are there David to find out about

R codes on there too right\nExactly it's the best of both worlds that like you said people want to feel something nowadays they want to actually touch something that they can actually see\nAnd they don't have the photo albums so this is a great way to bring all your different pictures together by making a calendar and it's not just like twelve pictures even have multiple pictures you mentioned the cue our coach so for instance on Christmas if\nYou know grandma and grandpa and do from Alabama and you're in Phoenix, Arizona you can have a little cue our code and then the kids use your smartphone and click on cue our code and it'll be grandma and grandpa thing and you know merry Christmas we're happy birthday or anniversary or whatever you want which is just so crazy\nYeah it really is because it connects right to a website that provides the videos that you do ahead of time I mean that's twenty first century calendars and the best of both worlds\nBut audio is also moving in that direction as well you know we often talk about interviewing ancestors older relatives and getting their stories but there are a lot of people who like to sing for perform music\nAnd ... a lot of folks are now going to the analog side of things in fact I had a buddy of mine\nWho had a very popular band back in the late Nineteen sixties\nThen he decided to get the boys back together\nAnd they went and recorded in a studio in\nLos Angeles with Nineteen sixties ear equipment tubes in Nineteen sixties era microphones and the sound is remarkable and there's something I think with a richer quality to that old analog seal\nHow it is in fact that the exact reason of analog vinyl records have come back so much they have a certain feel are flavor to them that you can't get no matter how well you master CD no matter how will\nYou do all your transfers you know it's still the digital medium when you have those analog microphones which are the two microphones\nYou record everything onto an analog tape you take that and edit it with the old way that we did with the scissors and such old boy and you can go and make things that just have such a neat Phil and flavor to him to give any old vinyl thing you know I have a friend I was just talking to on Facebook\nThat was just doing a new arrangement and his newest synthesizer he was used was Fifteen Years old and the oldest is thirty one years old\nAll this old analog stuff even in synthesizer that are digital and the old days they still had that analog quality to him because they weren't like overly digitized and the sound is just so wonderful and like two microphones\nNot only were they really really expensive they're some of the bigger companies are actually remaking two microphones now because the studios want them they're very expensive to make a very expensive to purchase\nOr they just have this rich sound that if you want that that's the only way you can go\nPricing support they do all of this before asking you for a
