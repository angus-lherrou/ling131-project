R. weather for the valley tonight mainly clear in low around fifty eight tomorrow mostly sunny and cool I Seventy eight looking ahead to Thursday will be mostly sunny and high of eighty one right now sixty three degrees in Phoenix whether brought to you by Howard here or there were police or if there were there and Kathy Klein on Arizona's new stations Katie a our news [noise]\nArizona's new [laughter] [noise]\nI can do three of\nIndependent and thought as punk rock in life\nIs the best in show\nWhat came out last week CNN reported that in two thousand and three well she went on the radio he said it was okay\nFor Americans to join the Taliban aside or were you know how we're running out of time and we have to wait how wedding apologized for the veterans me for saying it's truly are running out of the times\nYeah short did we learn last night I don't know what we learned last that I got to be a hundred and ten percent honest with you I don't know if I learned to Tom but what I Do know is that they don't seem to like each other I didn't learn a lot but ah they fired back and forth all kinds of stuff including gas the trees in one mix Sally Martha\nHas chosen to run a campaign like the one you're seeing right now we're assuming gaining on rent they kill us attacks and clearing my campaign is trying to cut cut cut and not share the pitcher\nYes mix Sally fired with the trees in cinema they're fired back saying it's a bunch of BS I I look at this and I'm thinking what what did I learn did I learn anything at all and I got to be honest with the I don't think I did\nI don't think I learned anything from them the health care you know as earlier is talking to Mac and get us and I talked to a few other people here and as you watch this and you watched it unfold\nLast night I said to myself\nI don't know what to believe anywhere because each one of the things that they say is sprinkled with a smidgen truth not all of its truth the stuff that ... ... said has come back and Britain are in the ass don't get me wrong there but in the overall scheme of things\nI don't know I don't know who what when how and why\nBecause it was first of all as awkward they didn't really look at each other they were looking in the camera wasn't position right so I said to me there are a lot of ... the mood is set by the people that are handling this and doing this and I don't know if they did it a great job I really don't think they did and and we're talking Chuck Todd and a Rona McDaniel\nOr a little bit later about this and how important is is but I just felt like at times last night it it kind of more than just miss the mark in both of them I thought having one opportunity to land a blow that could significantly change the course of this race\nBoth of them kind of fell flat it was it was like go it's like you spent sixty nine Ninety nine on that big boxing match\nAnd instead of getting you know McGregor versus may whether that was interesting and fun you got ... versus may weather which was like can I have my money back\nThat's kind of what I felt right there three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... Benson show is your Twitter you can tweet at us it is ugly to say the least this entire mess with\nWith the missing journalist uh Jamal cause Yogi and it is getting uglier uh by the second uh what what I'm hearing now this is what we're hearing\nIs that seven minutes of him being cut up his what took place\nWhy I said seven minutes of him being cut up you've now got Trump coming out and talking about well are we in this position now is this where we're at now with this uh yeah you know\nThis uh yeah you know let's let's let's just step back a little bit and and maybe maybe he is they're innocent until proven guilty and it's like come on come on\nNon and uh you know he's taking it on the road so it's very interesting for me to press Chuck Todd how you doing Chuck I'm pretty good how are you\nI Am doing great so your eye out here in Arizona you going to be meeting or the midterms very interesting uh it is a we've got a big battle going on out here but there's battles across the country\nYes you do I mean uh I'm doing going out west this week two days here you guys and Phoenix than ah than today's in Nevada and uh the next week it took a ... basically the end is I tell\nEverybody the midterms are being fought in the sun belt right basically from Las Vegas to Orlando um but the sunbelt states are going to decide which direction of politics is that left or right\nIt is it is very interesting obviously we have we have a we have mix Sally in cinema who they didn't do the battle I thought they were going to do last night it didn't really it it looked kind of a just look robotic I'm interested obviously tonight to you've got the big one\nWith Beto in cruise but these things are I mean you know the world is watching here in America is watching big time because there's a few seats that have the potential to go from red to blue\nYou know it's funny in these debates that I think sometimes it's not fair to these candidates for Senate you know as viewers we expect all of our candidates to debate like presidential candidates\nAnd the fact that these folks are not very um you know they don't do this very often and so I Do think many Senate debates can look more robotic\nUm then you realize because for many it's only the second or third time they've ever debated and in a format like that so I'm always a little bit I I I Try to give each of them the benefit of doubt but I tell you this this Senate race\nFascinates me because the two members of Congress before they started running against each other we're actually trying to beat each other one was trying to make a centrist to the to the left to wonder is trying to be the centrist that link right and then now they're both running\nAs candidates that you're you're not quite sure if either one of them recognizes the campaign their money\nYou don't want this last night 'cause my takeaway when I watch the the the ... the you know you either using Sally in their cinema and they're going at it and here you know\nThey're going to do which one's going to get flake seat I walked away from it thinking to myself self I didn't learn anything new and I don't know what to believe anymore and and for all the stuff of worrying about a Russia Russia Russia chunk of the reality is dark money and all of these wacky commercials and this propaganda you get thrown out of it is far more confusing than that\nI it is and it doesn't help when I think frankly I'm going to go after both candidates both candidates duck the press they are they aren't interested in\nTalking to the local press um and and and they both ... you know they both in very hesitant about\nSitting down for for interviews whether it be our reporters reporters from other you know it hasn't battered what network there from as a matter of any of that it is they have been letting their money do the talking with voters and I think that is why you find yourself in the way if you haven't scholars if you've been able to hear from either one of them in an authentic setting\nRight know sickly you've only seen them in a prepared studying either a television set where the debate without or a television set with the commercials\nYeah and it's nuts it's nuts talking to Chuck Todd or for meet the press she's not doing meet the mid term so you're in Phoenix then you're going to Vegas and then you're going to go out to the east coast you're going to go with Tampa and where else\nDallas uh where I'm not just that Senate race really in Texas more for the house races and all these places there's usually and all these places there's two or three competitive house seats to go with the competitive Senate race or the competitive governor for\nYou know it's funny that you know we shouldn't get used to and I think so many people are used to Trump and the way he wasn't the debates and we think that every debate is going to be some sort of reality television show and it's not going to be that way it's never going to be that way the reality is is like you said these people have done this very much and and and everything is is very sterile dial\nIs they're all you know and it strikes me as you can tell they all want to make sure they say exactly what ever they put up on our website and they don't give you more and and most most debate format\nFor eternity to even get more right at the end of the day you're just finding out which one of them had better and articulate whatever they are the best\nTime jak candidates is is in the unscripted setting is ending you know and you wish there were ten debates rather than just I think there's only been one out here and I don't know if they're going to have another one\nDon't know you know and you can tell that the two of them don't even talk even looking at each other and that is that is a shame because\nShame because you know the the you know where you're you're you disagree without being disagreeable but if you're not even knew each other um did you get his running against each other why are you supposed to get used to work together the venture you got to work with somebody on the other side\nSo true so sure about the big in Arcadia here in in Phoenix or we appreciate your coming on things much when you're really busy today but I think it's going to be awesome uh meet them in terms of trying to be out there to that you know war is my ... it's live radio there we don't work with and that's your jak appreciate them a man\nI area area you're picking the open desert sun here I have no problems [laughter]\nNever never presented that oh God you know what he is so right about like what was left so I'm watching mix Sally and cinema less I never wanted to make eye contact never wants to talk and and to me\nIt just seems so we ... we were talking about earlier at times at cheers in cinema she didn't look like sheep links and I see it across the way the one thing like that to the reason that people like better right so there's better out there the reason everybody likes it because he comes across very personable Ted Cruz that was a big knock because he's a robot\nThe opposite side for for for better or was he comes across personal but at least they feel like they're kind of in it in a way that a lot of other people don't and I'm just an I'm always amazed and neither of them will do press and that drives me crazy jet

seat to what's going on with with crews and bad though you've got to hide camp who's just pretty much over and done but what are some other races we should be watching that may surprise some people you know because it again the whole\nNumber of things to polls that that kind of a lot of people now step back and say I don't really believe all those polls look what happened on you know in November of ... years ago with Trump so we can't buy into those what are some races where maybe it doesn't look good but the reality is on the ground you hearing something different\n[noise] well I think Minnesota's state to watch right now that Senate seat there you've got Karen how late running against ... so that's going to be a really interesting race she the\nWife of a former NFL hockey and NHL Hockey player and it's a state that President Trump only lost by forty five thousand votes that they're somehow states their New Jersey Bob here again running against Menendez there's a lot of races across the country that I'm looking at that\nThere could be some ... that surprises but most importantly we have to elect Martha ... at the Senate\n... to be your governor and we have to elect Leah Marquez Peterson and Wendy Rogers and at Debbie Lesko and these great representative in Arizona\nYou know it's it is as I sit here and talk to you who you are you the chair of the Republican National committee and people always say to me you know you'll have somebody like grown on why don't you have somebody on the on the Democratic side I said I offered to and all the time I said I've asked me so I've asked I send them to come on a hundred times she won't I've asked everybody from the Democratic side I've got my bookers working on\nCome on I'll give you a platform I'm not even asked you questions you can throw it out there I'm not here to spin it and the reality is wrong but they don't want to do it and it it it boggles my mind\nWell because they're running as one thing 'cause the end they'll govern as another and send them as the classic example I mean Arizona is really need to go look at her record instead of the things she's right on it\nSaid and and what she's running as now she's running as a moderate or go to Washington I work with Republicans no she well\nShe absolutely well she just wants to help them keep the majority and and that's the game they've been playing all across the country will run it's one thing and then we'll go to Washington and\nDo whatever Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi tell us to do and that's the most important thing otherwise they come on you're shall and they share what they're riding on and they talk about their records and they take the tough questions but if she comes on and bite me back I'd love to ask her questions\nYeah well I doubt that's going to happen interest we've tried everything and and again not just\nYou know ... you're not just in Arizona nationwide we've we've tried everything was and none of them seem to want
