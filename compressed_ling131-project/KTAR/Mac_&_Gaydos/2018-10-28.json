curious in interested about what the home buying process is like here in the state of Arizona this is your solution this is your answer all you got to do is pick up your phone and we're not even going to make it call\nDo you want a free copy we're going to cost a physical book we're going to put this in your hands all you gotta do is ... book\nDo for one one Ninety two three that book two for one one Ninety two three All right so if you excuse me for a moment a few moments I'm gonna I'm just going to educate everybody here oh no yeah what kind of what kind of there's a there's a lot of things a lot of talk\nA lot of discussion of\nWhat's going on a not only in the real estate market or but but more so in in our economy and I think people are getting somewhat confused because what we're seeing right now is um\n... ... you know consumers are running under the impression that the market's going to bust and they're waiting for the market to bust and we're sitting on the fence we're not getting into the real estate game 'cause we're waiting for the market to bust\nPeople on the other side who are in real number one this is what I learned a lesson I always try to teach my kids is always consider yourself consider your source of information\n... where did you get the information that you're making your argument you're basing your argument from\nAnd so for those people that are just anticipating waiting for the market to bust my question is where are you getting that information who is your source you know and consider the source of information because the things that we read the people that were talking to the economists that we're studying are not anticipating a real estate market buff as a matter of fact\nWhen you take a look at appreciation appreciation across the board here in the great state of Arizona\nHas been at its normal healthy appreciation rate you know and and can average anywhere from three to seven percent that is a healthy rate that is where the appreciation needs to be\nUm what we're seeing when you're hearing about people talking about corruption in the market we're talking about them not the real estate market what we're talking about the economy do we anticipate a correction yes and when we when we\nWhen we anticipate a reset of the market I think for some maybe disposable cash is going to go down it's going to impact disposable spending or extra spending it's going to impact people at a personal level but what is not impacting and what is not anticipating to impact the jury is the real estate market\nThat's right I'm just here trying not to laugh at radio guy and like these classes\nThese glass or the best at a bar or my gosh I Wish\nEveryone could see right now I [laughter]\nI Know they're not clown glasses we need especially the ones that they're in the back of my iPhone case there are these little plastic reader so\nWhen I'm Out in about now right onto ... knows that was certainly I'd do it later [laughter]\nAnd radio guy [laughter] no but I did and everybody\nJust you know it's like their prediction of the future right because they have watched with the market his dad and they set out will happen\nNo but I think everybody just you know it's like their production of the future right because they have watch with the market his dad and they said oh will happen before it's gonna happen again everybody has their own theories about everything and\nI hear so much out there it's amazing how much I hear everybody has their own theory well where did you hear that from oh well my sister so you know whatever brother's friend and\nAnd and just take a look at where your house is vulnerable to potential robbers\nHow they could people could easily break into your house they give you some advice give you some suggestions this is all absolutely free and if in the meantime you need to get your locks change if you've been in your house more than a couple of years\nUm as probably time to

Gordon text or locked two for one one Ninety two three that's Locke to for one one Ninety two\nThree ... All right so let's talk about the fall I Love this time of year for buyers\nBecause I'm In one one thing I I think one of the things that people don't understand about Phoenix and and the real estate climate here in Phoenix we're a very very seasonal market there are times of the year that are busier for buyers and sellers and other times of the year\nI've always maintained jury that if you're looking to buy this may not be the time to sell but if you're looking to buy you want to be you want to buy during the slower market because homes are sitting on the market a little bit longer sellers of getting a little more desperate little more anxious to offload their property\nAnd and so there I think are better deals in more deals to be had yeah sometimes cells are hearing people oh well it's a slower time of the year ... the year so they naturally equate that well I don't want her than by now I Want to wait till it's a busy time of year will the busy time of year going to get they're not going to get as good a deal I think this is the time to really get into it well\nThis is also the time that only serious fires are outlook and wants to get into the holidays I mean for the most\nPart are you just drop the gauntlet if you're only if you're looking to buy now you're serious fire\nYou are very very serious I was I just had a listing of where I that was the advice I gave an you know I have to say I think that it used to be a little bit more and you know oh it's Christmas Time it's not a good time to lift your home I don't know what has changed a lot of people don't\nCare so much about not looking for home during the holidays but it it is and it's not that knowledge is much when someone serious it's that it doesn't matter and so if you put your house on the market you may not have as many showing that the people who are looking are really looking to buy so I I think it's a good time to put your house on the market if you are looking to to sell\nAnd I think that it's a great time as a buyer because there's not as many buyers\nAre I think this is one of the best times a year to be a buyer\nAnd not as much competition ... exactly and and so the best way to start and we'd been talking about it for years we've had thousands of our listeners take advantage of our free book offer so make that same offer to our listeners today the habit Texas were booked two for one one Ninety two three cars how we work at our on our team is Sherrie\nIs we're we're not a traditional real estate team traditional real estate agents\nOr our primary our main in primary focus is to help educate and help our listeners understand what the home by process is like that is why we have a no obligation no strings attached free offer and that is our book your personal guided by homeless than actual physical book\nWe will make arrangements to get a two year we love to personally deliver to you will take the time it come out and really just you know if you'd like having a discussion talk about strategy on on finding that next ride home but we do want to put a free copy of our book in your hands\nIn order to get that all you got to do again is ... book two for one one Ninety two three again ... book to for one one Ninety two or three well\nJust you know kind of continuing ... station about this theme\nOperation Haitian that's later ... [laughter]\nBut I think I I Do people who are are thinking about what they want to do I think this is maybe a time that they might say hey the holidays are coming up I'll just put that on the back burner and I'll Wait until January\nAnd as you just mentioned this is such a great time but not having as much competition means is that when you go to write an offer you might not have to pay quite as much for home because you're not competing with another offered that made the tensions becoming and\nYou have a seller who wants to hurry and sell their house they don't want to be showing their house during Christmas Time there are lots of reasons that you have great negotiating power to by now and we also know what the\nInterest ... these houses are going to sit on the market a little bit longer than usual\nRight and and another thing is we know what the interest rates are now they're they're sitting in a good place now we don't know what they're going to be in two thousand Nineteen so fact this is a great time\nThat's right and and another thing is we know what the interest rates are now they're they're sitting in a good place now we don't know what they're going to be in two thousand Nineteen so fact this is a great time to look into purchasing a home if you've been waiting for a good deal\nYou ever er and again if you do with like a copy of her free book again oh you've got to do is take sort of book two for one one Ninety two three that's book two for one one Ninety two\nThree you know sometimes you get into these situations where you're sitting with a salesperson whether it's a car salesman a timeshare salesman maybe even another real estate agent\nAnd you feel bad\nUh if if you use up a little bit of their time and then you're not ready to to move forward I remember a couple of years ago\nUh we had a and I don't want to call them out by name but we have this one of these big flooring companies come in you you've heard him on the radio\nAnd these ads in these of noxious songs and so forth so they come in and they do the little presentation and my wife and I just wanted to think about it and and so we really feel like we got guilt it into it like his children were going to die of starvation in the event that we didn't find the dotted line and I remember afterwards and the quality of the foreign sucked\nBut that's neither here nor there I'm like I felt bad one of the things that we do and one of the things we specialize in our program here is we will drop off the book Jerry\nWe'll sit down and have a strategy session with you will even set you up with her proprietary search functions on our Web sites that are mobile apps and so forth and if you're not reading and if you don't want to ... there's no guilt we're here to educate we're here to help\nUs write and I you know that's the thing is I I Wish everybody felt like that I felt like yeah where they they're worried about wasting our time in real estate yeah sure right not always the case but but I Do think that we have I'm sitting\nThere but the point is I Want to be clear we're sitting down we're having a strategy session with you're talking with you your future goes it's not

up they had some inspection issues and so I Know and I'm just yesterday and I said you know before you and your realtor come to terms on how you want to negotiate this with with the seller let me know

you to took stored fun\nTo for one one Ninety two three picks word fun to Fort Irwin one Ninety two to three want to put you in touch with funny me and kept on Christie our friends from home a bridge\nYou know I've been out to make that that a lot of people don't realize that they have options even when they're going to purchase a new bills\nUm and that that this is something else that they can do so we had um\nThan any or just stepped in a client that I have that's making a very large purchases with a builder and they've been going along the process and didn't realize that they had so many different options now they're getting a better rate they're putting less money down they're much happier with the processing there's been a lot more communicative and these are just things that they didn't realize because when you go to the builders office everything seems to\nHave no option that's right well and I want to I Want to add onto that lady's because one of one of the things it's like um you know it's like if you if you have a cold\nCase it doesn't really matter\nWhere you go doesn't matter who at the doctor's offices you or it doesn't matter whether you go to a twenty four hour your place or ... you know whatever you call those places it it it doesn't really matter because we're we're talking about a cold\nAnd when you're making small purchases uh whether you know it's a laundry soap or ... or ... or barbecue tools you know Amazon's okay it's great to go on line it's great to be able to push a button you don't need to talk to anybody\nBut when we're talking about a a serious purchase\nA like buying a home where you're borrowing two three four hundred thousand dollars or going back to the medical example\nWe're now when you're talking about when you're having her problems in in a major problem you know it doesn't matter where you where you go and it does matter of getting a second opinion and getting a third opinion because it's a major decision who's ever going to operate on your major decision will buying a home I'm telling you\nThe last thing you want to do is rely on a website to spit out a report spit out this without that spit out your options\nAre because there are certain things and I know we're going all digital and everything's all about technology they're still certain things in life\nWhere you need a live person who can examine and evaluate your personal situation and give you the best solution so I say this for those of you who just relying on the Internet or a big box bank that shuts down at five and you can't talk to somebody on the weekends\nAnd in order to evenings when you're agents taken out it's time for the second third opinion\nWell and and I think that goes to the same thing with a builder to for someone else to tell you what builder ... so so shop around it\nThird opinion well and and I think that goes to the same thing with the builder to for someone else to tell you what ... ... so so shop around get get some options and we love for you to talk to our friends here because we have trusted them for how long have you been working with him oh thirty two hundred years [laughter] that's funny 'cause I just turned\nForty okay well thirty nine and out here [laughter]\nAnd the only thing that I mean I Do we we have a lot of conversations we talk about\nWhat our competitions doing what's on the Internet so we're we understand what's going on out there and and there's so much in the fine print that people don't understand it like\nOh wow you know I can get a rate at four percent well yeah and it's gonna cost you three points you know so I really do that to do that but you know we we push in the best deal and then what the deal that makes sense for you for your long term goals\nAnd if you're if you're sitting on a program a pre qualification maybe that you that you got on line\nOr maybe from another lender but you know all that it doesn't seem right and I talked to people all the time it just doesn't seem right that they seem like there might there has to be\nBetter options out there or you just got something from a website or the very least you know what I'm give her friends at home bridge funny be kept on Christie just the opportunity to give you a second look\nTo give you a second opinion because this isn't a major financial decision that you and your family are making

right\nThe airwaves we share with you the golden nugget of the natural information and uh every week and I\nYou're faithful host can rewrite had been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients\nAnd we are a for money matters that special we we specialize in a retirement planning so we work with people primarily or over fifty retired are retiring soon\nAnd if that is you we want to work with you as well and the show is designed for you and I recently barons of Barron's Magazine named Anwar you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors for the seven year in a row yeah wow is right I'm very impressed by that but you know what\nWithout our clients we would be absolutely nowhere so I I give it to them I don't I don't take any credit for that\nNow since we are a firm that does that that specializes in a retirement planning [noise] um we we all this you know\nIt's a different philosophy\nBeing a financial advisor to somebody who is about to retire or is already retired than it is if you are talking to somebody who's in their twenties or thirties\nIt's just different when you're in your twenties and thirties you're on a fence you're growing your money you're being aggressive you know you can be more aggressive you've got more time I'm chances are you're not going to be living on that money for a long time so you don't have to take into account withdrawals from the get from your money so you can be more aggressive you can take a little bit more risk\nAnd in the long run if should pay off for you but\nThat isn't the case once you get\nWithin five years of retirement or five years after retirement in my opinion I think at that point you have to start thinking about preserving and keeping what you have\nTo go and so I think there is no doubt and so risk number eight of the uh Eighteen risks that are the important risks that you face during retirement is market risk and this last a\nCouple of weeks has really been an example of why that is such a an important thing\nHere's a study by Wade file that showed the impact of market risk on retirement income planning\nAnd you know when we visit with clients and what we talk about primarily is we want to get you the income that you need you know to support the lifestyle you're going to have during your retirement so you know Social Security comes into play in that if you have real estate if you have a annuities all those kinds of things\nBut anyway they looked at a hundred and fifty one hypothetical portfolios each earning market returns with the only difference being the thirty years that was measured\nAnd the amount of money that was accumulated for retirement varied a lot\nAnd the average accumulation was ten times salary or during these are the thirty years prior to retirement but outcomes ranged from three to twenty seven times salary depending on which thirty year period that was tested so it means when you start is really important\nNow the impact of this of specific rates of return in the final years of accumulation when the value was the highest had the most impact on the ending value meaning that in the last years of your retired before you retired those last years are the most impactful on how much money you're going to have\nWhen you are now going to retire now\nThe other thing that they looked at is taking those same portfolios that those those hundred and fifty one portfolios\nLooking forward now okay so now you're retired and you look the next Thirty years the forward and using a constant inflation adjusted withdrawal strategy or he also found that the actual maximum sustainable withdrawal rates over thirty or periods ranged from one point nine percent to are you ready ten point nine percent\nAnd the sustainable withdrawal rates are disproportionally explained by the returns in the early part of your retirement\nSo the five years before you retire the five years after you retire or the most important according to study and I agree with that I've seen it in in with our clients it is the most important ten year period of your entire financial life\nBecause it's the most impactful five years before on whether you're going to be able to retire and five years after whether you can stay retired though [laughter] even do market risk create some uncertainty other research shows that retirees may not be able to afford not to take some market ... you have to take some risk\nBecause if you don't you can't you won't keep up with inflation so there's some risk you have to take\nAnd uh so one thing that ... a research does show again ...\nAre increasing your exposure to stocks not hiding everything away from stocks does improve\nYour portfolio sustainability and the ending wealth amount that you'll have after certain life expectancy periods and again to address inflation so what is it one of the things that they don't talk about in that study is what we do which is to have a cell strategy\nAnd so you know you look at that one point nine percent basically let's call it a too\nIn that study is what we do which is to have a cell strategy\nAnd so you know you look at at one point nine percent basically let's call it a two percent withdrawal rate why is that well because during that period where there was that a where there were a lot of beer markets during that period and so if you were taking out a higher rate what would happen is you'd run out of money and so do you have to bring it down for that those particular periods\nNow with our cells strategy we looked at it also we have a high degree of confidence that our clients can take out more than one point nine percent and not\nRun out of money but of course one of the important things about financial planning is that it's not cast in stone right you start you go and then you start looking at what's happening and you adjust accordingly you know I liked to equate it to an arrow and he guided missile\nSo an arrow a bow and arrow a is all the intelligence that this air is going to have is at the point of release ride you're aiming you're taking into account when you're taking account all the stuff that's going on and you aim at you release\nAnd that era that's all the information is ever going to have and if the wind picks up the target moves you know something happens it's going to miss\nNow a heat guided missile on the other hand it's constantly adjusting and its tracking the heat of its target\nAnd it's following it wherever it goes so that's what financial planning in my opinion is it's a heat guided missile that you are searching you you're constantly keeping your eye on making sure that your client never runs out of money that's the goal that the target and you adjust accordingly as you go\nA and I'm going to talk about later on in the show if if you had a preference of when you would have to lose money would it be earlier or later and we'll talk about I'll give you some more specifics on that so if you're retired or retiring soon\nThen one of the things you should be thinking about uh with some anxiety\nAh is what's been going on over the last few weeks you know this market is shaping itself up and it looks like we may be on the verge of a of a bear market despite the good news and you know the thing about their markets as they come when nobody expects them I mean if if if you think about every very market this happened\nThe vast majority of people did not expect it you know if everybody expected it probably wouldn't happen right\nSo therefore it's important

are for ever\nAnd diamonds are have her and we are back this is money matters with\nKen were rape and of course I Am your host can re\n[noise]\nThank you diamonds are indeed forever I think they should be right hardest known substance is not right but you know what I think that a financial planning ideas that help you achieve your goals or even better than that because\nIf you do it right I think it's possible that you could buy yourself a few diamonds here and there and if we are back I Am can rewrite the host of money matters with Ken my rape and I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty\nMarvelous wonderful and very exciting years at all the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same idea that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients and we are affirmed that specializes in retirement planning so we primarily worked with people that are over the age of fifty who are retired or who are retiring soon\nAnd do we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states and we are honored and blessed by that and Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors and this is now for the second time [noise]\n\nAnd uh you know thank you jak for that a little tempered either but you know what without ... without our clients we would be no are so clients listening right now and those of you who are not listening we we adore our clients and though we are so grateful and in fact you know I Want to share it with you something and and when asked\nYou ladies and gentlemen I'm over ... since October the ...\nYou know you may have noticed that ah the market has been very volatile in fact I'm that first week of October the ... the ... the Dow went down Thirteen hundred points that we remember the eight hundred point drop day\nAnd then it followed up with more and more and we've been down pretty much every week since then and us over the last three weeks the market has gone down quite a bit and my question to you would be\nHow much communication have you gotten from your financial advisor\nOkay because I think when times are rough when it's getting scary out there I think that's when we are in our keep you know we have two goals for our clients one is for them to have financial peace of mind\nAnd peace of mind I Believe comes from communication if you know what's going on and you have confidence in what's going on then you have peace of mind in my opinion and so\nSince October the AIDS\nWe have sent three videos which I produced and uh and we sent our clients to talk about what we thought was going on and what we're going to do about it and all of that with a purpose in mind for them to have a direct contact with us by a video where they can have peace of mind where\nWe can set their mind at ease the were on top of it and we're watching things and they don't have to worry about it okay I don't know if it works I think he did that hopefully it did a but also uh we've had three emails as well I think it may actually before a where we talk about conditions situations are portfolios and all that kind of stuff\nWith our clients so over the last three weeks we've had six and I actually think it's seven\nI'm just reading from my notes here but I think it's seven communications with our clients regarding the volatility in the market\nAnd again it's because our goal is to give our clients peace of mind and our second goal is for their money to last as long as they do that that's also important that peace of mind is important too\nSo I Would ask you do you get that same sort of thing if you don't then maybe you should consider making a change I don't know uh and you can go to our website if you want to learn more about us it's money matters dot net\nAnd when you're there you can look through and see what you think in a click on meat with an advisor if you'd like to do that but let me ask you a question now because we are as we we primarily work with retirees and people who are are going to retire soon\nWe are defensively minded when it comes to how we manage your money for you okay so what I mean by that is that we believe that you have to preserve your principal to be able to provide you with the income to enjoy all the things that you want to do during your retirement\nAnd we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want you to go play and have fun and whatever that looked like to you we want you to enjoy it to the hilt but you know what if you lose half your money in a bear market it's going to be very difficult to do that right you could lose the ability to do it\nSo let me ask you a question the average bear market according to net Davis research is a loss on the U.S and the thirty seven percent thirty seven percent of the average\nNow back in two thousand eight and went down to fifty seven percent and in two thousand it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than normal the ... an average the average is thirty seven so the question I Would ask you is this\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money\nIf you had to obviously prefer not to but if you had to lose it [laughter]\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money if you had to obviously prefer not to but if you have\nTo lose it [laughter] that's not an option here you're going to lose thirty seven percent okay so when would you rather do it when you're sixty or when you're Seventy five now interestingly I've asked quite a few people that question and the answer they've given me is I Would rather have it happen you know when I'm when I'm uh sixty\nBecause if I lose it when I'm sixty I have time to recover it you know I've got time\nAh but that's actually wrong\nUh we've done studies where if you lost thirty seven percent and you've taken inflation adjusted four percent out of your money\nAnd you assume and ... percent return on the market what would happen if you started when you're sixty and you lost a big chunk right off the bat you'd actually run out of money by the time you were eighty\nHowever if you lie if you lost that same amount when you were Seventy five\nThen it would take a while before your money runs out in the last step into your nineties and therefore guess what you probably won't run out of money so the answer is you want the farther out you can put losing that money if you have to lose it the farther out you you push the better the earlier you ... it happens the worst\nAnd we talked about that in our in our second segment of uh with the research on wet you know how market risk and affect your retirement\nSo the the big point of that conversation I just had is\nThat the five years before you retire\nAnd the five years after you retire we consider that ten year period to be the most important period of your entire financial life okay because\nNo matter how much you money you've accumulated over the course of your lifetime you spent Thirty years doing it if you lose fifty seven percent of it in the year before you retire that's going to hurt your resistance God Phil Gramm I Am do very persistent now the other side of it is that if you retire\nAnd within that five years you lose fifty seven percent like happened and why and then two thousand eight or even thirty seven percent which is the average then that also could significantly cause you to half a natural difficulties and not to be able to enjoy your second childhood without parental supervision\nSo we believe that protecting your principal having a by holding cell strategy is very important\nAnd that's why our strategy told us to to sell to get our clients out of the stock market to tell her clients to be out in in November of two thousand seven and to stay out during the entire craft of two thousand eight so here's what I Want you to go to our website at his money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd sign up for one of our seminars or or visit with one of our advisors or watch videos listened the podcast read articles all those

no tank All right maybe I can get buried by for me he is in Virginia yes and he's actually having a lot more trouble than I Am he had his information that's the first time I've seen this on a show\nThe first time I've heard someone call in and say their information was sold\nOn the dark Web was sold correct she's ISP had given him a warning that they had seen some sort of breach\nAnd that large amounts of data was being downloaded away from him um when they were not home like fifty gigs at a at a chunk wow then who's the security company that he's with contacted him and said that his email and possibly as password were sold on the dark Web\nWell I'm sure it wasn't just as email probably right and that's all of a brave of a problem we detect a he also said that he was part of the target breach and the Equifax breach [laughter] so this guy I think part of\nThe Yahoo and talking about that and just to find [laughter] gosh or guy you know he said and did you win the one point six billion dollars this past week buried come on\nYou know I did not and did you play no I Do not oh I played\nI didn't win I think when like seven bucks that you play Andrew oh yeah I was in an office pool and I bought an individual tickets did you win anything I haven't checked my tickets 'cause I don't live in South Carolina [laughter]\nThat's true so you are so you've not had a good time or the last couple of months huh\n[noise] well it's all happened just for you in the last month when all this information came to me\nI said okay and so and so you were so the information that that they told you just what you sent to Andrew is that that your router was compromised and your email account was compromise is that what I heard\nThe what they believe is\nOkay and then what steps have you taken since\n[noise] everyone said the same thing that I needed to immediately change passwords and make them complex\nOn the route or and also the change passwords on my email and anything that my email is used for to get into in a kennel Mm So for instance a bank account if I sign up with my email I should change the password correct sort of done all of that\nOkay and now you're under and what else can you do wow\nWell yeah I'm Wondering about like is there such a thing as an ... for a home or or some sort of a bundled up chicken by the monitors things\nUh it just seems like the alternative is to put a different programs or some place like Mao or bites an anti virus and password manager and so forth and I'm looking for something more comprehensive and this is serious business here [noise]\nUm this is all of our data and I'm concerned about maybe some a professional type of protection\nI say okay and you know what and rightfully so I mean because you know ... it's it's once you get your data compromises you feel so vulnerable don't you I mean it's like sure you know all this was going on and you had no idea until somebody told you that this information is being downloaded through the router\nAnd did they say that maybe your computers are being used to house any type of pirated material\nI'd never heard the ...\nOr a cause that's a lot of data fifty gigs in a day I mean that's huge ah so\nThat's one more than once and you feel\nYeah so that's what I was thinking that maybe a because what sometimes with the the hackers do is that they find vulnerable computer and they house files are there\nAnd then they tell everybody to go access the files on your computer\nOr so that this way they're not liable or you know they they it's harder for them to be tracked okay to be tracked down\nA so I Would definitely go through and look at data usage on any type of gadget that was connected to it you know with the route or like you said like you know you give it a good a password and you can also do Mac addressing have you lived in into that\nYou know get media access control\nOr what that means is that the only devices that are going to have access to your router of those devices that you\nPermission okay and and so I Would\nTurn that on for Mac addressing I you also want to make sure that the DNS servers have has not said that they have not been changed as well\nUh and you can get into your router and also your max to do that turned on the Mac fire walls also with your Google Account you want to do a security events check there's a lot you need to do Barry really I'm\nSo much so that what I'd like to do is to write this up as a tip for you because this way you have everything all laid out and then also folks that if it ever happens to you that you have a resource over at\nFor you because this way you have everything all laid out and then also folks that if it ever happens to you that you have a resource over a commando dot com that you can also tap into\nAnd we'll put that together as a tip this week for your barrier put you on hold and there's going to get your email address as soon as we get a written up I'll go ahead and make sure that you get a copy of it before it goes out any further\nAnd again this is valuable information something that we should all have at our fingertips and I'm so glad that you call them story that have happened to you but as always you can hit commander dot com for trusted advice stay right where you are we have more of your phone calls and more tips coming up you don't want to miss you're on the\n... commando show [noise]\nMarriages source for everything digital digital got is Jim Jim [noise]\nWith more and more of our lives mood online intrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences\nAnd so if you go over to apple dot com and you have to actually ... to the bottom of the page crank and then there's an option and the second comment says refurbished and clearance\nIs that you I think you might be able to start looking and you know you look this weekend but you know as more people are buying the newer stuff that are going to be trading and the older stuff right\nOr selling the older stuff whatever may be and so what I live with you by re for ... for Apple is that it tells you like for example what what year was this Mac book released and then if the screen has
