for until you more about that and just a moment but first here's the phone number one triple eight eight to five fifty to fifty four is the way they joined us and of course when you're calling in there's Andrew but been skiing that Kim commando show man cave hello there Andrew\nKim Eric is in Cincinnati, Ohio and this is the first I mean I've been answering phones here for a long time long you have to say how many years seven was Seventeen no no sixteen years there's gonna be Seventeen then it's almost Seventy a\nLong time we should probably talk about not being an intern anymore you know what I'm going with it OK yeah less pressure\nUm and like you scoffed at when I said Seventy I Know\nWe can pick teen God Andrew ... so Eric\nYes or he wants to be able to anonymously put photos on the Internet\nAnd when someone normally call for that I usually have a one line like hey that sounds like you want to break the law we're not going to put you on the radio to break the law but he actually has a good ... you know what 'cause it sounds like revenge porn or sharing yeah it sounds like something shady yes but he has good reason he has to have four adopted foster kids and he wants their grandparents\nTo be able to see what they look like but he's not ready to fully dime in on the whole communication from\nAn interesting question yeah that is because it's so so Eric you want the grandparents to watch the kids grow up\n[laughter] yeah that's exactly correct but\nI Know I was gonna say so is this an open adoption is that what happened\n[noise] no we adopted these children earlier this year they had been in foster care for four years prior to us getting them and we had them for a year before we adopted them so they've been out of the biological home for five\nOr wow okay and this year the father the biological father passed away in tow um we had some feelers out for people who who have\nContact and they asked if we could bring the children to the funeral and we said no we're not ready to do that yet right\nUm but they said well is there any way that we can we do watch them grow up and so I was looking for some way that I could anonymously present them pictures that they can see but I also don't want to just throw them out on the Internet for anyone to say I want to be able to target who can see them\nI I get that I get that or you know first of all what big heart than you and your wife must have to take him for kids how old are the kids\nThere are seven eight and an eleven while\nOkay it's a full household [laughter]\nIt's a full house for other kinds of our own so [laughter] wow that's\nAwesome that's awesome [noise] a couple of thoughts come into\nMind uh of course when you post photos you're going to make sure that there's no identifiable characteristics you know\n... and so forth and\nYeah I Would take out all the all the men of data and the E. X. I. F. data and\nYou're going to have to use a photo editing program to strip all that out right\nSure uh because a lot of people don't realize and if you're like what the heck are these two people talking about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pulled it down is that I can open up the hidden data and then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera\nAre just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you out of school photos number one\nOr you put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call\nIs that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shutter fly okay shutter fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address they could just keep going back there to refresh it or say once a week or once a month and so they could start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of\nThem going to see it as well [noise] okay uh so just in order to shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again there's going to be some options when\nYou do this that you're really looking for your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access\nAll those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of racist stuff in the back and\n[noise] All right let's talk about one of our great sponsors there're works relieve their works relief\nLike many of us do you suffer from muscle cramps in your legs in your feet well to experience relieve do what I Do you want to use their works relieve\nFast acting phone get their or works relief today it's into the pain relief file at your local pharmacy or at their works relief once again dot com\nOr before the back of your phone calls I got to tell you about a phone scam that's offering phony Amazon dot com jobs because especially this time of year\nAs a matter of fact we just did a pod cast command on demand about the whole gig economy different ways that you could earn some quick cash just in time for Christmas is that job scams that claiming to be from Amazon or totally on the rise\nAnd here's how the scam works listen up you get a voicemail inviting you to apply for a job at Amazon it sounds like a pretty sweet set up I mean you can earn anywhere from twenty dollars an hour to maybe even as much as six thousand dollars a month catfish you're working from home\n[noise] usually those are websites with fictitious names like a Amazon cash Amazon cash website ... jobs you name it\nBut here's the catch when you go to fill out the online application you were asked to purchase a two hundred dollar enrollment kid and then once you make the payment poof\nCameras gone all your money your dream of\nTelecommuting and earning cash in your bunny slippers so any job that issue for some sort of a front payment should should set off warning belts and if you are looking for legitimate ways to earn extra cash maybe you want to be an online tutor a virtual assistant or maybe you want to even watch TV and take\nSurveys yet you can make money doing that\nLeft no further than the official homepage Kim commando show which is of course ...

Lambert is cheering on his Boston Red Sox\nLet's see how it's going for the chief genealogist of the New England historic any logical society and American ancestors dot org\nWell it's going really well in in town for anybody who's a member of Red Sox nation I'll tell you that that was quite a beating the Yankees got in on fire boys I mean\nYeah yeah yeah I don't want to hear about that All right let's oh come on you ever met a man with what they said well\nIt's New York you know what can I tell you about that by the way congratulations to my friend David he's got a book out that's been around forever it's called a guide to Massachusetts cemeteries and it just was released and its third edition and I know that helps out a lot of people you started that when you were really young didn't you\nRun out of school started as a rolodex so yeah the third edition just went to the printer last week showed about a month we'll have it here in American ancestors but I'm really proud of and the role of extra being over three hundred pages long now for every ... every town\nNicely done All right let's get going with our family he stole our news today where do we want to begin David\nI work in the beginning in Sweden whether they're really cute story eight year old shock to the young lady who went out into the middle of the lake on what you thought was a stick put it in a loft and she was holding a Fifteen hundred year old sort\nI mean I don't think there's any more important but on the ancestry side then that shared match button right\nI agree yeah absolutely that's the key thing that I use all the time in my work trying to find people's families and understanding of shared matches is of paramount importance\nIt's really complicated sometimes though when you start going from okay well I I've got a match to this one I assume that recognize you go to the matches matches and sometimes you can start to break it open that way if you had that experience\nI have that something that you need to be a little bit careful with you don't want to take too many hops and assume that the person is still related to the first person that you started with especially if you've got colonial us ancestry\nWith rod imagine that's your thing but I Do that all the time with my own matches if I find somebody that I don't recognize\nIdol American the notes field matches known you know Smith Jones defendant or you know whatever light and they are and then I'll look at the shared matches with that person and I will say matched to matches of something I typically don't go any farther than my own research but eventually that information can be really helpful because\nYou know especially when you're working with more distant matches not everybody's going to match everybody else but that doesn't mean they're not related if that makes sense\nThat makes a lot of sense you know there there are a lot of little tools on ancestry I think are under utilized but I think are really helpful and you just mentioned one of 'em that little note area we're matches and people are worried that some of these people will see that but of course you can't see bad it's just for your own personal notes on your own account\nRight Margot kinds of stuff there which means you don't have to look into that to see how they're related just click on the notes and you'll see the whole thing you can put in their ... Morgan's you share you think this person might be related drew what's the dominance is you might be what the relationship is often put in you know three she\nToo far for third cousin twice or something like that and by keeping track of that it just makes it a whole lot easier than going through now now where did we find that person again\nBecause you think you're going to remember all of these things you know it goes by like that I like this before so yeah and\nUm that record keeping step is fairly important with my own match if if I Know the relationship with her cousin or whatever I'll put that in I'll put the number of sending organs that we share so I don't have to look that up again common ancestors and I know it and then I Will put in\nMy matches entire ancestral line from the common ancestor set themselves in those are nice things to not have to keep\nUp again and again in the right absolutely\nOne thing I just wanted to add um you talked about not having to click into the match and being able to look at the notes\nFrom the main page and there is a extension for the chrome browser called met better DNA that makes it even easier that you don't even have to click on the little notes icon it you can can figure that to display all your notes on the age when you look at me and match paid sweet\nYeah it's awesome and then that makes it a little easier to do some searching and I like to do that especially with my first paycheck matches I'm always\nKind of looking at that his new what's different who don't I Know who they are those are the ones that really kind of get under my skin if it's somebody that's in my first fifty matches that I don't know who they are and when I can see all the notes than I can see who I don't know and those are the ones that I kind of tend to focus on a little more\nI'm Talking to ... and she's a DNA specialist with legacy tree genealogy Richard how far back do typically like to research your matches\nWell it kind of depends on how closely related they are to me or to the person\nThat I'm researching so you know if they share sixty Seventy Santa Morgan's they're probably a third cousin is how I Want to go back at least till they're great great grandparents um\nSometimes you can go not so far and then the connection becomes clear that off and you have to go at least that far or maybe even a generation back I don't research everybody that I encountered at fourth or fifth grandparents because there aren't enough\nOr something [laughter] yeah right but it's a fine line between not spending too much time on everybody but going far enough so that you're not missing something beyond a key person\nKnow I'm just thinking you know when you go to break open brick walls which I think is really the primary purpose\nOf finding these matches other than confirming maybe what you think you already know when you get back to the ... to aids boy it really gets complicated in so many of them to try to sort through and mom's side dad's side which\nLine and sometimes they're tied to multiple lines because you're from the same area it gets really tricky but if you can find those to the fourth cousins and at least break open your brick walls to the third great grandparents level that's that's pretty exciting style right\nIt is and yeah I I think I miss him terribly your previous question but yeah the fifth cousin and\nI look at some of them I don't look at most of them and I hear people comment on the total number of matches including all the distance matches you know I have twenty thousand method I can look at Paul well of course you're not going to end that shouldn't be a goal you know I Will focus on some that are in the fifth\nTo eighth if they come up on a surname search and then I'll explore that a little more and you know hopefully they might have shared matches with some other people who are in my first cousin a closer list and then that kind of get my attention and right\nAnd it's important for people to know by the way if you're trying to match people who were first through fourth cousins they won't show you the matches you have in the ... the apes cousins you go to the AIDS cousins and click on matches it will show you any closer relatives you have up to fourth cousins\n[laughter] that's true and that is a point at frustration for many ancestry there although I have to say now three years into this I really have come to see the wisdom of that decision on ancestry is part\nI think Fifteen cent mark and cut off would be nice as an ad on but the processing power involved with that I don't think it's going to happen but I think it's better not to have their shared matches list muddied with you know seven eight ten and mark and matches I think that ultimately creates more confusion than clarity\nYeah that's true it makes it difficult though when you're really trying to work on something a little bit further back yes he would be nice to have the option although I'm thinking if the options there then it's basically going to be all in or not [laughter] right\nRight right yeah in a former lifetime I wrote software for a living and so I thought a lot about the implications of that\nSo I don't know that um what kind of improvements would you like to see on ancestry I'm adding more colors to their stars yes the huge ... stars right\nThat to me it's surprising that it hasn't been implemented yet because it seems like\nWouldn't be that difficult to change it I think it would be\nA real crowd pleaser for their customers so that's one and I'd really like to see more search capabilities you know we've got the surname search and you can search location which you can't do both\nYou can't do both and the ability to put in a first name you know when you're searching other people's trees especially in a really common surname that you're looking at one of my husband's ancestor lines is faith and can search ... from Virginia but it's just overwhelming and\nSure most of them actually end up matching some of their line completely when I look at the shared matches and if I could put in the first name and date of birth and that sort of thing that would be incredibly helpful\nWell some great ideas and a great advice Gretchen Jorgensen from legacy tree genealogist thanks so much for coming on the show\nI don't think his son\nHay and

M. C. place dot com are preservation authority how you doing Tommy I'm super fabulous yes you are and here we go the holiday season really is upon us right now I mean it's just crazy here it is October ... and yet we really got to be thinking about these things because\nFamily history gifts are not normal Christmas gifts or holiday gifts you got to put a lot of thought into them you've got to put a lot of effort into them there's often a time lag in between planning a project executing putting it together in creating a gift and then figuring out how you're going to deliver that gift right\nExactly that is so true in a lot of things we need a really remember\nAs a member of the old days we bought a toy for one of our kids and they got they were so excited and then\nBattery is not included the battery if that's true and so the same thing goes a storage whether you're making brand new memories or whether you're taking old memories and making them available to other people one of the biggest things we deal with today are asked the cards as the car is like a portable disc type thing but they're very very small\nAlmost every camera takes some computers you're by now days whether it's a mackintosh or PC has\nSlots are put in as the cards almost every camera now take Jessie cards a lot of people have smartphones and I think there is no slot for nasty caught at my phone so I guess it doesn't affect me well you can buy adapters a plug into your bottom of your iPhone your Android and then put it past the card in it\nSo that makes it really easy to share things\nBoy that sounds so much easier to process for a lot of storage and a lot of the solutions course have more to do with the cloud so what's the advantage of a nasty card over cloud storage\nWell the thing with an essay card is instant\nAnd it's not just for storage and nasty card is actually what rights too if you have a video camera and doesn't have a built in hard drive it writes the ask the car and there's so many different flavors of as the cards you need to make sure you have the right one could if you go to something really important like a big Christmas Party and you have the wrong as the card\nYou can't say oh hey let's do the party and an hour from now I Need a run to the shore and trying to find when it's open with the right as the card\nAre All right so there are different types of Bessie card so how did these apply\nOkay basically there'll be printed on and that helps you a lot there'll be like S.
