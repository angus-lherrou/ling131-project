the debate it's going to be mixed families coming out swinging this is what she wants she wants to turn it into a street fight she wants to make an ugly\nShe wants to talk about all the things that's how bad cinema cinema has played this thing pretty much straight forward as possible even starting this off when Sally came out through a couple of punches what ended up happening she just ignored it a a ... a cinema and went on with it\nBut the reality is it is hard it is hurting her in the polls that shows that it's hurting and they're both I see a lot of polls that say it's close I don't know if it's his closest people think\nI don't know I could be off I couldn't be completely wrong about this but I have a feeling that this is for all intents and purposes not as close as people think\nI don't I don't know but this is that they're going to throw down tonight and I'm interested to see how she handles it because here's the thing we have asked on how many questions the crowd and\nI so either white grants in there and why and grant has probably emailed there are people more than a dozen times called their people God Knows how many times and in doing so we've got nothing from scent of his people ... he's been here a couple of times we're just trying to figure out what is a good time to get around but we will eventually ever on\nI'd like to have cinema I Would but I you know because my thing is is people ask me who you're going to vote for you before you know what I have a made up my mind I don't know about any of these what I Do know though is you're avoiding stuff\nWhy are you not talking about some of these stuff\nHow can you and I I'm not saying you have to go out and hammer and say horrible things because I find that to be to me\nIt doesn't do anything for me it's it's a big turnout you go out and you talk about a horrible the other side is what I Do is I step back and go what are you going to do and that's what you came out tonight and said look I'm not going to talk about this this is what I'm going to do for you I Want to hear\nWhat you're going to do I want to know what are you gonna do\nHow are you going to push for that's my big thing what are you going to do that's going to be completely different moving forward comparatively the what we've seen\nIn in in the past is she is she the next maverick I heard some people say is she going to be different than any I don't know what what was going to end I shouldn't have done or the salary is going to be I think I kind of got a feeling for me personally but\nHas cinema really become a moderates\nOr is it just all a game I think that's a question I think a lot of people want to\nAnd a lot of people wonder is it a game is it only to get elected or is she really somebody who's moved away from her from her radical roots 'cause she was radical for time and she's acknowledged that people and\nGiant\nFrom everything else that game for why\nShown\nAn honor to be here with you tonight and Martha it's good to see you were going to have a good conversation tonight on the issues that matter most to Arizona families rising healthcare costs protecting Medicare and Social Security and keeping our country safe and secure\nBut there'll be some differences that you'll see clear in this evening I been laser focused on the issues that matter most to Arizona families an everyday Arizona's one Martha has chosen to run a campaign based on nasty smears and false attacks\nAnd I expect you'll see more of that this evening but Arizona's now that I've never been afraid to stand alone to do what's right and I always work with anyone to get things done in Arizona and that's the approach I've taken the United States Congress\nCenter right there as she opens everything up and and the debate is going on right now who's going to get Jeff Flake seat and it's very interesting you have all the polar opposites here and the officers where the campaigns have been run up first of all yeah it has been very negative uh Michelle has come out and she is hit hard and she uses negative\nAnd the other side of it you got here since the mid that's largely ignored a lot of that stuff and kind of run her own thing but there's times I think she could have answered back she'd have to be negative but I think she could've answered back it's nice to a real chance to sit down and to look\nAnd shear\nWhich one is going to do for the voters of Arizona for all Arizonans the best they possibly can but Sallie of course is is Mick Sally she's going to do her thing you kind of know what you get with her\nI'm now serving in Congress and I've been leaning on the issues of supporting our military securing the border and providing more economic opportunity for people and I've been consistently doing that both serving in Congress and now running for the Senate my record is clear and it's consistent unlike my opponent\nAh unlike her opponent and this is one of the things the big things that they've talked about when it comes to do cinema is one who was she she was this hippie liberal communist than his socialist than all of the things you've got the ... to do and everything\nAnd you know and now all of a sudden now she's running kind of a moderate a Democrat over\nThe years I'm proud to say that I have taken the time to learn and grow and occasionally you haven't changed my opinion when I served in the U.S Congress for my first several terms with congressman Sam and he and I worked together on a variety of issues including keeping our country safe and growing businesses in Arizona\nAnd protecting trade so over time I think it makes sense for individuals who are willing to learn and to grow\nThe difference I think between Martha's approach in my approach\nIs that Martha opposed to many of these issues before running for Senate and then changed her mind very quickly I've been serving for many years in the United States Congress and before that in the legislature\nAnd have over time been able to grow into coming and better at my job serving Arizona and and folks now in Arizona are always put their interests first never party\n... and that I like to hear stuff like that I mean to me that sounds great you're going to put the interest first you know I'm I'm a big\nPeople over party kind of person a which both sides of the aisle I think many times fail or any you know again I\nWhen I see ads I mean I'm inundated twenty four seven with that if it's not on the radio right it's it's on television it's on pop opposites everything and you get frustrated because you get the negativity I Want to know what you can do for us I Want to know\nHow you're going to work for us and I've said this about ... I don't want it to be I'm just going to do whatever the president's doing I'm gonna fall that\nBecause of the Republican led Senate and the house\nAre working with this president we rarely see more opportunity for people in Arizona and I'm going to keep working with him in fact I'm going to host him at Luke air force base on friday and then based that cares and send them I wanted to advocated shutting down or when she was first running for office and this is really important and I'm going to keep working and then when I'm In the Senate\nAnd to me well can that's great I Want you to work with the president and his cinema ends up winning I Want her to try to work with the president it as well I mean I don't you know in this day and age you\nWith the with the the fact that we're completely polar opposites when it comes to our political world in our tribalism so great that reaching across the aisle unless it is something like\nA what's taking place in Turkey where you've got both sides of the aisle upset and angry over the of the death of the journalists\nOwe the fact is is I don't know how much she will work with it if cinema once but she's going to resist I'm sure in a lot of ways in saying that I also want to know what you're going to do for Arizona but I also want to know what what are you about\nRight what\nRight what are you about how will view of all what are you going to do and both sides of runs the negative ads but mix Sally is definitely been in the lead in which he talks about the you know the closing of Luke air force base and all this stuff I've seen the postcard or right and I know that makes Sally didn't have anything to do with the postcard\nBut the postcard of Phoenix blowing up because of a mushroom bomb\nIf you if you go and vote a cinema and that was like really wow that's a step right there three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter you can tweet us ... lotta stuff still to get through the night as they battle it out Casper is an amazing mattress I have one of been sleeping on for a long time\nIf you if you first of all how\nYou go to bed you're going to spend six eight ten hours\nOn your Casper on any mattress and in doing so that's a long time when you break it down day after day why would you want to be on a mattress that awful alright Casper is incredible thing I Love about it first of all it's a no brainer what you try it it is amazing\nThe sleeping cool to me is the most important thing but my body feels absolutely amazing for the years that I played sports and I put myself getting beat up over and over again\nTrust me I Love it especially with my back to what are you waiting for don't look at all of the the imitators out their Casper\nIs what you want and they've got this are you ready for this\nHundred night risk free opportunity tried your own oh that is at risk free or you have to go to Casper dot com use my coach at when you do you're going to save yourself fifty bucks right there on selected mattresses that's Casper dot com coach at\nFifty dollars toward the purchase was elected mattresses you're going to absolutely love it Casper dot com coach at terms and conditions apply at chat Benson shows your Twitter C.

so bleak warhead\nFor the big story watch [noise]\nHere's what came out last week CNN reported that in two thousand three well she was on the radio he said it was okay for Americans\nTo join the Taliban on the site or were you know we're we're hanging out of time and we have to wait and our wedding we apologize to the veterans me for saying is we are running out of the times\nThe grenade that was told that the last second in last night's debate logic here since cinema cinema makes Saleem exactly saying hey didn't you tell everybody to go when I was okay to join the Taliban\nThat really what gear since ... will tell you in a second but\nWe heard Martha McSally a cue cinema of treason here is a ... why do we think she's going to probably suits and send them a response is going to be like super non home yeah and non non confrontational\nMartha has chosen to run a campaign like the one you're seeing right now I was right here where she maintaining and ridiculous attacks and swearing my campaign and she just trying to cut cut cut ... share the full picture\nWhat cut I don't know what that means she's trying to cut cut cut what does that mean to cut cut cut me I\nGuess cut the cut the audio or cut the video the way she wanted to appear okay instead of playing the whole thing like prostitution charge ... or something like that so\nAfter the debate Martha mix Sally speaks to the media about that last minute I don't know what you want to call lobbing of the grenade reason bomb yeah here's what you said after the debate so Martha McSally how can you use the word treason\nBased on what he's heard CNN article came out last friday that in two thousand three in a radio interview they said are you okay with American joining the Taliban and she said I'm okay\nAs they can show that the Taliban and I was fly like a ten more hog I mean this is a definition of seasons saying it's okay for Americans to join our enemy that responsible for three thousand people dying on nine eleven and thousands of soldiers afterwards and you think that's okay she wouldn't even apologize\nRead if you listen at the end you can hear it have you listen to that interview to the whole thing because we have actually listen to that two thousand three interview and why don't we play for you know\nIs Martha mix Sally smart to bring this up from two thousand three is is this a smart move well you'll only knows that\nThat you can only make that assumption or you can only give your opinion on that if you actually listen to the radio interview so here's here's some cinema in some am blow hard you know zero talk show host trying to uh get sent a mind gets to say something\nI Do think that those of us who who are privileged to have more um do something to others I don't like more ...\nNo no no I don't buy more me as an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army\nI go over there and I you know I'm I'm fighting for the ... not ... I'm Sorry that's personal decision and I asked I Want to do in World War two and I want to join our area and you know fight the Germans bomb and London as an individual I have no problem you can do whatever you want with your money not mine but I think\nAnd they're never going to get any better and I don't mean to be disparaging against Central American countries\nBut they don't take care of their people ... ... exactly and the and the and the the the governments are jokes and the president can't fix this in like two or three weeks when he also shouldn't be threatening to cut off aid as well because then you're going to get a lot more people in these caravans coming here\nAnd this is from a different country we've talked about the asylum seekers they were from Guatemala\nThis is now Honduras so there are people that are now emboldened and feel like well it's a Guatemalans got back and only two percent or ever repatriated well then why can't with the odds of me surviving that tracking staying in America is better than living here which is unbelievable by the way\nThey ... that you would have to make that decision ... now is overwhelmed with asylum seekers they don't have all these different churches that can come and feed people later about them\nThat are about a population of two hundred thousand ... okay you drop off a couple of people a week that's one thing they can absorb that drop off over two hundred in a day ... where are they going to go I guarantee you they're going to find their way to Phoenix above even and even when\nI was ... bus pass from human to Phoenix yeah and you go to a church that ... possibly can handle you're positively because that's where we talked about last week rightly so valley churches that are taking an immigrant strike who by the way\nHave come here legally and its asylum it's not illegal immigration eighties eighties claiming asylum which is a hundred percent legal right it doesn't guarantee that they can do they know they have to go through the proud and it doesn't make it easier on America right right\nBut but this is only going to get worse I I think it is only going to get worse it started with just
