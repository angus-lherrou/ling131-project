where we view them as somewhat of an ally in the fight against Iran and the spreading of their terrorism but\nAlso financial implications there's huge investors into a lot of our companies they want to be a part of that and it's a very weird relationship it's not as easy as saying let's just dump them right here an actual\nRelationships with us Saudi company [noise]\nThings we work on together all across\nReduce the risk to the United states of America in the world's largest sponsor terror Ron\nYeah and it's it's it's ... and again it's a very weird relationship and there must be something if this is to be believed and there's no reason for not the all the evidence said that this is what happened here\nHow what exactly went down is well that's being the ... that's being debated but what we do know is we're hearing now that he was given tranquilizers\nThat he\nWas tortured a little bit than he was killed ally ... by being potentially saw they were showing off his fingers and doing things of that nature and the potentially dissolved the acid\nIt is awful the only way you can describe what took place to to to show he was just an awful horrific situation and there needs to be some repercussions\nBecause there's no way doesn't go to the top\nNow what will that be that I don't know you've got somebody like Trump was coming out here and essentially saying yeah I don't know if I Believe\nAll of that\nSure seems inclined to believe those denials as he told the Associated Press here we go again you know you're guilty and\nAll of that they sure seems inclined to believe those denials as he told the Associated Press here we go again you know you're guilty until proven innocent I don't like that and then he actually went on to compare the situation\nWith the Saudis and the accusations against his Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh saying quote we just went through that with justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I Am concerned the president it seems very much inclined to believe the Saudi denials in this case\nAnd it doesn't mean that you know that that that he won't do something but with Trump you never know you you never\nEver know what Trump will do and what he is or isn't going to believe\nYou're getting many Republicans out there the Lindsey Graham was so upset yesterday and if you didn't hear Lindsey Lindsey is beyond angry about all of these things and there is an absolute reason why Lindsey Graham is angry uh and the reason is pretty simplistic\nHe pushed hard for the Saudis he pushed big time for the Saudis\nDisguise wrecking ball he had this guy murdered in a conflict and turkey and to expect me to ignore it I feel he used and abused hours on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good ally\nYeah and he feels like you guys hoodwinked us you use me even Barris me and so to several of the Republican so the Trump is gonna have an issue dealing with that\nAlong with several other things this the financial implications if we pull out but there's also the bigger geopolitical implications and the implications that goes to who's going to be hours\nThat's going to work with us it's going to stop the spread of Iran and Hezbollah and things of that nature\n\nThat is a question that is going to have to be asked sooner rather than later and I don't know who is going to be now some other Republicans are coming out and they're saying hey look\nLook you've got every right to be passed\nDown that was for their own thing if we don't have the un Saudi Arabia but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that we have to just cut them off of this song is find some of my colleagues was that was\nYeah so it is weird it's weird\nIt's a bizarre situation and that's John Kennedy right there a Republican Louisiana who's just always makes it makes me laugh some of the stuff he says uh but he's right and so ... what do we do at this point in time and that's for Trump to figure out and how much they can actually prove that leads back to the Saudi king and how much will actually find\nA that leads back to the friends I mean I don't know and how much will actually you know even if they find something how much will actually hear about\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ...

two thousand three radio interview here since ...\nThose of us who who are privileged to have more on do something to others I don't know I don't buy more me as an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there or not you know I'm I'm fighting for the Taliban that I'm so I guess personal decision and I asked I Want to\nI don't care if you want to do that go ahead okay so um mix Sally says that's treason and she said that during the debate\nWhat came out last week the reported that in two thousand three well she was on the radio he said it was okay for Americans to join the Taliban to say that we were we're running out of time\nWe've had Ted and Ted had run last week\nSo that was kinda thrown out by ... or an aid over you know there was only a minute left in the

that in two thousand three in a radio interview they said are you okay with American joining the Taliban and she said I'm okay with that now\nOur enemy I can show that the Taliban and I was fly like a ten more hot\nNot what you said right now what she said it all okay and and I don't mean that I misheard it or you misheard it she didn't say Americans should go fight this guy this ... the okay

didn't say Americans rise up joining the Taliban America socks that's not what she said but Mick Sally came off to me a little desperate and a little strident when she's trying to make this thick\nGhettos at the pod cast make sure you subscribe by taxing the word pod cast for one one nine to three a Phoenix police and I would assume all police departments they want to interact with the

doesn't stop what he calls an onslaught with in fact about two thousand migrants who fled Honduras and are making their way north and a caravan\nMexico has said that migrants that have proper documents enter that country but those who don't have to apply for refugee status or face deportation\nSo the president knows that there is a caravan heading towards the United states from Honduras about four thousand people will he closed the southern border he's going to be in Arizona to nights he's going to stay for the next couple of days before he leaves singing to shut down the southern border\nI Hope not but\nThis is what he wants to do now whether he can do it is a totally separate issue but he is threatened to take eight away from Honduras and El Salvador Guatemala he threatened Mexico he is also said well I'll just send the military will shut this you know soccer down or whatever\nI'm fine with ... with him throwing all that stuff out there because you got to figure something out to stop people from continuing to come in I I don't know if he pulled the trigger on any one of these ideas he's already put out All right so Trump\nJust tweeted about Fifteen minutes ago I I'm Sorry he retweeted something from a a Mexican a journalist okay rights for an American publication\nOn the migrant caravan to federal police filled planes with anti riot gear landed near the Mexico Guatemala border this morning Trump retweeted with thank you Mexico we look forward to working with you\nOh so he's threatened to Mexico and said you guys better stop them from coming in because if they're caught if the caravan of the people are caught Mexico they're going to be sent back\nI mean there will Mexico we all the way are different than our law right if you come here and you want to I'm a claim asylum writer a border we have to let you in that's the law not belong in Mexico right so I don't know if\nThis is Mexico's way of\nI guess making nice with America making nice with Trump going when their job doing they're doing what they're supposed to be doing or will they let the caravan end and the anti riot ... is is just to make sure that everything stays orderly and they just let them through and they just escort them up through\nMexico in the United states the president seems to think hey Mexico you're going to stop them thank you very much\nI don't know I don't know I don't know if Trump thinks that's actually\nMexico and then I said the president seems to think hey Mexico you're going to stop them thank you very much\nI don't know I don't know I don't know if Trump thinks that's actually going to happen I think he's probably hoping\nBecause he wants it to be Mexico's headache instead of hits true true and you know Mexico could escort these people to the border yeah you are correct and then they got to deal with Trump right do they really want to do that I I don't think they'd want to do that I\nMan that's like bring your dinner with your kind of stuff there in Sacramento dinner westbound slowly start from that you will to Santa and all the way out to eighty third avenue and like I said in the traffic report that doesn't even get to the stadium yet you're still another ten minutes away from State Farm stadium from there I always recommend on game day\nGo with the one on one it's usually bad but not as bad as the ... that's true again today but we've reached the point where when I say bad it's bad it's now heavy heavy slowing\nFrom rain tree west all the way to cave creek we took a crash on and it's blocking the HOV lane you got to stay right for that and then it's light slow and go to Seventy Fifth Avenue but that's only forty minutes compared to the gym\nAnd I were detour Dan Katie era news traffic a there is\nA game it's five twenty in the west side Tempe at six o'clock are we expecting worse traffic or do you think people have gotten people have heard what a dot said and what we've said what you said and they've already left work are we still expecting a heavy rush hour after five\nWell I think for a lot of folks you can't help but avoid it if you got to get west on the ten you gotta get west whether there's a game or not and now it's damage done the the freeways paralyze\nThe problem is being rush hour and would that other football game starting the one option we thought we might have would be the he's fountain lighter than usual because everybody's head west it's not happening the town is loaded up east bound and now the too old to read my freeway starting to overload without game day traffic coming into temporary if not so bad there yet on the red mountain\nBut we're approaching people should have left uh for the game when you were doing traffic on the morning show yeah really I think I Would have a
