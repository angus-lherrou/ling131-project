K. that's busy kid dot com forward slash became busy kid it's allowance simplified now\nWe just heard from Caesar and Honduras about this migrant caravan obviously a different perspective than most likely you're going to hear especially if you're listening to us in the United states we're just about everything comes out of New York or Washington DC we are this is not something new we see caravans these border issues\nI Believe that there are no coincidence is in politics I think just like well we're learning for instance out of a Saudi Arabia and the Turkish constantly there where they're trying to claim that there were mistakes or incident coincidences we had no idea or we're shocked shocked to hear all about this\nUh it goes on and on like this but there are no coincidences are there are plenty of mistakes but there's a big difference between coincidence isn't mistakes\nAnd here we are before a midterm election uh Trump's number one campaign issue dating back two years ago when he began his run for president was the border was immigration was the wall\nAnd here we have conveniently in you've heard what the Caesars comments on it that we've got to\nThis uh this issue that suddenly is a right to you know days before our mid term elections here uh I always liked to say besides asking questions of people outside and with the stories originating I always like to ask you and myself just common sense 'cause that's about all we've got left I mean our institutions are failing us\nAh we've got a doozy and our changes hearts segment today low energy edition by the way of what I've been told is the title of it of a classic case where again\nYou will have what is alleged to be the gold standard of American corporate journalism\nWhere they are claiming moral outrage and moral superiority and then somebody doing real journalism and we'll explain it all coming up in about thirty five forty minutes you won't want to miss this\nWe'll explain it very simply somebody coming along and doing real journalism completely bans a this fallacy and all that the gold standard you know corporate owned a journalistic you entity that's you know try to take the moral high ground is claiming that there that you know these are real journals\nAll their only what they're left with is is again willful ignorance\nOr incompetence I mean that's all you've got there's nothing left there's nothing there's no good choices and that doesn't they either want to limit H U is the gold standard of journalists even eliminate you as the bronze standard of journalists that's coming\nBut back to a Caesar Honduras no coincidence is in politics in this midterm election coming up that's where we all we start in the common sense question is is\nYou know we know there's you know the migrant flow we know that people are constantly going on all across the border but you know why does this get attention it's just like the Sochi\nIn Saudi Arabia coming up but also in the program we're going to talk to a one of our journalists our voices from the middle east do knows a lot about being a journalist in repressive countries\nAnd ... you know we'll ask the question and discuss is it unusual that Saudi Arabia would detain arrest kill make disappear or a journalist or a critic he's like no of course not\nA same thing with turkey a you know same thing with so many other countries then why is this case suddenly are being told we're we're being told here in America is the most important case in cars so she's the most important journalist out there\nAh you have to ask yourself that question too I mean if it's unusual then you make estate cycle it's unheard of and we've never heard about this a journalist goes disappearing\nA no no if it is there's plenty of evidence that that should be expected I have said many times on this program for instance\nThat the reason why you hear so many so few people out of Saudi Arabia on this program we'd had him but it's very rare and as I've said in this case to get somebody actually living in the kingdom that will talk to us\nThis program we'd had him but it's very rare and as I've said in this case to get somebody actually living in the kingdom that we'll talk was not even a journalist not even a critic just to come on a program like voice do America originating in the United states\nNext to impossible it's like North Korea it's like how do you find somebody in North Korea that will come on this program to talk about their governmental issue Iran they ... that tells you all you need to know we do with all the time\nYou were calling in there were emailing folks were texting people\nThey just go radio ... and of course we know why yeah not for lack of effort I can assure you that that it's not like they haven't come on before that's the real till till you know sometimes when I got tired of it we don't like your show doesn't matter you know these folks come on the program before\nBut they even tell us it's difficult for me to do it I'm not comfortable talking this is not a good time this was the feedback I can tell you we get\nFrom people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd it shouldn't be a surprise\nAnd that that that your common sense to me that's kind of tells you what the heck is going on over there you know I don't need to listen to a government spokesman already Elizabeth NBS I don't listen to Trump try to spend me around to try to figure it out and it's the same thing with this migrant turban do I believe that five thousand migrants just originated in Honduras and decided\nOr conditions are so bad we're just going to march all the way up to uh Mexico today of course there's organization there's political motivation behind it and\nJust like everything else you have to ask yourself where are you on the food chain [noise]\nI also think there's truth to the fact that people do want to come in and of course they do want for it because of economic hardships in because of political asylum or just flat out safety I Believe that's also true\nBut five thousand two weeks before election and the corporate media are all over the story of they're pushing the story it's just like the Sochi wider the corporate media push to search\nWith journalists go disappearing all over the middle east all the time including in Saudi Arabia why this migrant you know how do they form why is it five thousand why are the media all on this those are the questions you should be asking because those are the questions that I certainly and that's got to be our starting point\nAmerica where the world comes to talk\nOn taxing isn't affordable solution for driving revenue in creating brand awareness millions of people listen to pod cast and now you can be a part of the action if you want to elevate your current pot cats or just getting started\nTo cast pearls can help the pros or experienced ... characters who do all the hard work seems you can focus on connecting with your audience the cat ... work with small businesses global brands an entrepreneur is able to guide you every step of the way with the Clinton selection editing ... get looking and performance coaching\nThe United kingdom first and foremost is saying it's a we absolutely backed Donald Trump one hundred percent so before we get to talking with Rick you keep in mind again the obvious questions what narrative has been fed to you and me okay what narrative comes publicly from New York and Washington DC or if you're listening and places like London for instance to\nThat narrative is is that Donald Trump is in bed with ... and if there's some type of secret deal that they've caught or\nThat they're just buddy buddy and that Donald Trump will do whatever he has to do to please a lot of ... and he hates NATO and he's trying to destroy the world and all the NATO members can't stand him and he does nothing good for NATO\nThose are all the narratives that have been long established for the last two years now you have to ask yourself why would what would motivate Donald Trump to do this and we'll try to get to the bottom of this but does this look like a favorable deal to Vladimir ... who's real a thorn in his side his pebble in his shoe is always been NATO\nNumber two how does it play with a narrative that you know Russia's fixed the election and Donald Trump is only in the White House instead of Hillary Clinton only because of ... and is this some type of reward is this the payback that so many folks uh that worked for the corporate media or work in Washington DC that are running in these midterms\nOr how does it fit into that narrative and then you have to ask yourself the fallen question to this is relatively fresh news and it's as we also know corporate media only deals with one story at a time and there's a reason for that and we've explained that the flood his own one at a time they can't cover multiple stories at a time\nAnd so they build like a reality TV script you know there's there's a payoff you invest in and you introduced these characters you introduced a narrative and then you push it push it and there's got to be a pay off they're not going to vacate the script halfway through because they haven't gotten their pay off yet\nSo this charade the corporate media for instance actually covers news is clearly a charade and we've talked about that long before Donald Trump came along and long before this idea of fake news came along as a matter of fact we still maintain and I think really the only ones\nTed Koppel we played a clip for a couple of weeks ago he seems to be on our side on this one too and I'm purely open that I'm wrong\nThe only ones Ted Koppel we played a clip for a couple of weeks ago he seems to be on our side on this one too\nAnd I'm surely open that I'm wrong but first and foremost what motivates any corporate corporations money it's money some political agenda not favoritism I like this person I don't like what drives them is money and if their economic model is being threatened or squeezed or if it's thriving by doing reality TV\nCovering only one story at a time or not doing journalism but some form of entertainment then that's what they're going to do first and foremost because it got to make a buck\nAnd I still maintain so before we get in to Ricky\nKeep all of that in mind in in in that if there's been this large investment that ...\nIs a is a you know the Donald Trump is molded lumber putting Donald Trump does nothing to upset blood or ... and he's only after destroying NATO\nHow will this fit in they'll figure it out and I don't have all the answers but the point is is on first blush you're looking at this and you're saying you know Russia has come out and they criticize it is it fake criticism yeah um\nWell you can decide Rick yellow soon as I said missile defense advocacy alliance he understands all these missile systems I chatted with them for the program and I asked him why with Donald Trump cancel this thirty year old treaty with ...\nBecause they've been violating that you know for the last probably Twenty years and it's uh been really a much more a drastic over the last two or three years were Russia's trying to assert more influence on Europe\nAnd so there's been some demonstrations and obviously a movement of of those type of missiles that break the treaty into colon gr either directly or threaten or the European continent\nWhat types of missiles in layman's terms there's this treaty address\n... any any missile over that range or over the air me it rained this is why we pulled out of the Persian it's when Reagan pulled the perjury twos out if you're with this is the start of this treaty not to have long range cruise missile long range ballistic missiles\nThat ah go beyond that range I think it's five hundred I'm not sure what the exact number is\nThat was limited to Russia is now I'm deployed goes uh in colon grab a man have demonstrated those capabilities in Syria that go beyond those ranges a that we're uh we came to terms with with Ronald Reagan\nNow remember when Russia gave a very public almost in an advertisement or a public relations campaign about how they have these\nThese new missiles they were developing and they could travel around the world and he had these this cartoon or an animated drawing or those types of missiles that would be bound by this treaty\nThose are more should teach Eric muscles and strategic capabilities strike United States that go there they were not bound by that treaty well we're talking about is um the hyper sonic muscles are not included in this tree so those are outside of the treaty\nThis treaty does not allow\nI think again you have to get the numbers right but I think it's five hundred allowed five or ... or a thousand kilometers\nUm max on that saw limits your ability to strike um beyond that range I'm sort of the limits or the ability to have long range capability Arab intermediate range capability in Europe to shock shark Moscow\nAnd for Moscow, Russia or they'd be able to strike London parish ah except write those those countries we took all that out\nSo been broken that capability by having deployments of missiles and testing those same deployments in Syria that go beyond those ranges\nChina is not part of this treaty but Trump made a point just last night's publicly to say that China is part of the problem and that he is seeking a new deal not just with Russia on these types of missiles but also in China what does he mean what is he getting at\nAll because China did not sign with the INS treaty that the United states signed with Russia and Ron right they were a void of that so they were able to do and deployed those ranges that were\nThat Russia was in the United states we're not so they have developed and deployed that capability so he he would like\nChina to fall back into a you know a three way you know let's get everybody back in the loop and nobody's develop between whatever it is a thousand kilometers\nAnd or the ... and the tricky one arranged capabilities which we have salt agreements or or lemonade agreements on those numbers so there's a gap there that China than ever\nSalt agreements or or lemonade agreements on those numbers so there's a gap there that China never was able we've never was never agreed to\nSo they're unlimited capability is this on my off also tell you that the hyper sonic threat that China's going and the Russians are doing and we're starting to do\nIs not treaty a compliant at all and there's no treaty for that\nDo you think that this exiting of the the Russian deal is more about China than it is about Russia and Trump is trying to send a message to China\n[laughter] no I don't think China is going to pay China doesn't have to pay attention China doesn't really care I think this is a a deal to get Russia back in the box and and get them so they're not as threatening to the European allies\nAs they are today and I think it's also you know for the Europeans to start burden sharing some other capability that will need\nTo be able to put Russia back in the box it's all about the status quo as you have the president wants to keep America great\nAnd America the way it's been so that means we are the superpower and that means that we you know strictly it here to anybody that threatens that status so he's gonna he's going to fight that\nRussia Today says that Trump's actions and their words are it's a very dangerous step how do you interpret that Rickey [noise]\nI I think they're trying to back away from a bit in the endgame here or going to win that because their economy can't afford to to do with their we're we're we're proposing is very similar to what happened in in the eighties with with Russian and Reagan\nSo we have a better economy we're going to be able to move out or move an out they can't compete with that they're going to have to come to terms now with some sort of negotiation\nTo stop us from our development and get back on their control so that they they they can't they're they're not going to win on this and no shape or form\nI I Am going to break out on this treaty no way how does\nHow does this Trump's exiting this missile treaty and then having the Russian government say it's a very dangerous step and having a NATO members like the United kingdom for instance vigorously defend Trump's exiting or how does this play\nWith a very popular in common narrative here in the United states by much of our corporate media for instance and many of our politicians that Trump is somehow in cahoots with who and and that their buddy buddy\nAnd that doesn't mean that there were a buddy buddy he wouldn't withdraw from Mr grant this agreement is corn now Russia's violation\nConsistently over the years on this treaty and we are now forcing a different play and if you look at our documents and department of defense we're aiming China and Russia as a threat and we have a tremendous defense capability\nKids five to six team busy kid motivates and encourages them to make actual decisions with their money as parents to oversee the process\nFizzy kid provides

cover the coming to America\nAnother migrant caravan we talked to Caesar in Honduras also Trump exiting a thirty year old missile treaty a pact with Russia talked to Ricky about that coming up this hour we go back into the middle east to talk about the very latest from ... we just get word got word from turkey the Tuesday is the big day that the rule out there\nA reality TV a style production on what they've uncovered you know everybody wants to tapes\nThe question I have is they all they claim they've got audiotape or they've got videotape or whatever they're going to come up with I mean\nThe whole area of all of this of course is is that the detailed and even just common sense we've had so many people on from turkey\nOr talking about a president or to wanted his his government the power grab that's been going on over there or this is a country that regularly sensors shuts down there to the free press or any press jails journalists runs journalists out of the country and yet they're going to come in here and they're gonna\nThey're gonna tell us what's going on the problem now that we're in the tech world too is that let's say they produce a tape isn't the first ... first thing that Saudi Arabia will\nDo or its trolls or whoever they hire to do the counter\nIntelligence they'll just saved that tape is made up because we know you can make up tapes and how you and I going to really ever know goes back to one of the principles of this program that we always talked about we will never know we don't know what's going on in Saudi Arabia will never know what went on in that conflict we don't know what goes on in the White House\nIt's all just speculation so the best that we can do is try to get as much ... decent information we can and then ultimately you just have to say All right I've done enough work on this this is what I Believe\nDoing just hash tag I Believe that's probably not good enough I mean you've got to actually do the work like we always say don't believe anything you here on this program we're the only media outlet that says that everybody else is saying we're like your family you can trust us and they show him you know sitting behind a desk and\nPosing with all the wrong burgundy or hugging a legit listening or they walk down the street they try to do a fake man on the street\nGo to Mars and\nIt's it's all actors and it's all of that business you know we always say look here what we have to say because the only thing makes us different is again we go to where the news is happening we talked to people get a\nForeign view of America but don't stop there\nTo keep working try to figure it out\nAnd then you know ultimately you've gotta you've gotta come up with your on your own idea but anything that comes out of power structure their job is to keep you in the ignorance that that that's the first part of that comes from the White House from CNN from Fox it's to keep us ignorant just to manipulate us what they can leverage that to to make a buck off of cars are\nLots of shares struggles\nWill always be [noise]\nJust a total change in the music there at the end yeah reality television go ahead next one\nAnd my daddy's parents herrings literally to marry my modesty to read was part native now just sort of discrimination was common\nFamily her album racket Hedges and middle class my three brothers went off to know how to use my mama's grant to get through commuter college in Moscow he's my daddy's for optimism when I was balancing baby [noise]\nPlayed no role when my hiring\nAnd that is that she she's talking about that because she knows that she didn't she didn't want to be Native American or at least\nYou know growing\nUp that she she's talking about that because she knows that she didn't she didn't want to be Native American or at least publicly until she needed it for a career because they were you know how to Harvard and now they are you hire and that's how everybody knows that game and that's what he's referring to there and ... and then the final clip please\nJust casual racism ha ha ha ha faced discrimination neglected to violence for generations and Trump can say whatever he wants to\nMocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get me\nOkay that that last ... proof she she doesn't get it\nSo but they're getting so you what you're supposed to be ignorant and your spice she did she say me now to you right she said oh yeah and as these below you because I mean again if you get to my age you heard this show ... or I mean you've heard all this like uh the minutes somebody's got the music behind it and she's pumping out a video and she's a senator he did\nThis with the IRA ... with Kim Jong il right did it with that too right so but she doesn't get it she doesn't get any she didn't any Native Americans in marginalized and blood right but you didn't make the case that's fine but\nWhen she's talking about the Tomahawk chops and everything right

forties like my age I Would think fifties and sixties but again I go back to thirties or twenties\nOr you're the most vulnerable your ... ignorance you're the most I have not because you're stupid but just because you're young\nAnd you're the youngest voting bloc right so does this I mean you say you're not fooled by but did you say most people in your generation would listen to this and it would

Facebook all of that\nAnd call it fake or disseminate our own narrative and confused be I mean that's what's out there right now\nAnd we do that so you wonder the value\nOf anybody in an official position they used\nVoice to America where the world comes to talk\nI'm catching even affordable solution for driving revenue in creating brand awareness millions of people listening to pot cattle and now you can be a part of the action if you want to elevate your current had cats or just getting started the cats can help\nThe pot pills or experience I Can't get to do all the hard work you can get fined connecting with your audience to catch crabs work with small businesses global brand an entrepreneur is able to guide you every step of the way with the Clintons selection editing ... get looking and performing coaching\nAnd made them back especially the autumn is extremely that did it at a ...\nLike the idea that what happened come visit to Saudi Arabia they died hundreds of billions of dollars worth of our so basically what happens if a only needed in years really it's given did nothing for free\nA dollars worth of our isn't so basically what happened is are all these deans usually it's given day it's nothing it's for free so in the un there he angry with them that environments and men would be the next game looks out at ... ... is there anything you're getting as much if at all [noise]\nNow what happened in the key here NBS as during the time he was in power has been has been proven to be extremely good luck to a shocking extent anything he ain't touched that eight and a ... is from Saudi Arabia yeah\nThis family that weren't they part of his family I can yeah yeah yeah yeah I\nHave his family members and like very big business people weren't why what that is one of the wealthiest twenty five people in the word uh well he'd been but I Love your on your on your on your back\nAnd he like other things we've never heard of that country\nAbducted the prime minister of another country and if you're a member we spoke about that we didn't have ... you know he went on and then by needs prime minister is proven to be extremely extremely or reckless and I think I hate to do and it's scary extending like ... we didn't hear them wind cannon\nBut now that you're not ... but one thing curry or ...\nBut one thing that it sounds like he has a shrewd Lee\nOr marmalade is this idea that he some young reformer\nWith western values you know women can drive we love Hollywood we love Silicon Valley I mean this is directly aimed at the west and man it seemed to work when he was here recently and in ... but he literally got a treatment of the royal treatment in a way he he's he's been shrewd also has the the\n... and I mean definitely he was treated like that oh yeah in a way and it's part of his marketing campaign in you know the ... better than that Saudi Arabia and modernization and we've been back it's nothing everyone has been looking for in Saudi Arabia and the middle of the United states it's a great that but this is\nThe marketing campaign what's happening politically under the stage is not really that much Scotia and that's the key here\nSo a smokescreen you're saying in the ... I don't know what you mean like what's the is it is a serious about the reforms oh yeah yeah yeah very much so he is the it is about better come on you're not a smoker and many of them right now\nOn a smoke screen but it doesn't mean that he's going to completely liberalize or reform the country there are still the very archaic portions of Saudi Arabia like if there's somebody that is a journalist that doesn't like you you you'll Gillum and drop 'em up\nOh that's yeah this is not part of the other night I think just as you know freedom of speech is nothing that you were speaking about letting women drive and are having parties in the street and movies in movie theaters that by the way that the freedom of speech in fact you they're worse now\nWhat about what hit that point yeah no no I had back\nAnd cream you've talked to us on this program before about your difficult dealings I mean literally where your life was threatened by a by those including the government inside Egypt right now but it is the\n... like this was the most of them got ... yup\nThe Muslim Brotherhood on you know you were doing an alien very popular TV show\nBased on a Cairo now in Saudi Arabia if we're talking about today today ... is it a ... here in the United states people didn't know who are Jamal so she was a week two weeks ago now he's as popular as anybody in America\nIs this unusual in Saudi Arabia or the journalist go disappearing do they get killed or they get put in jail on a regular basis\nIt's extremely and not and you will it's very it was sworn into things like that happened by Hitler thing usually no one would bear to go against Saudi or a royal family like\nIt's very uncommon to find someone to start with that with Trump decides that do you have a much may think that when I tell you yeah about what's happening but between Saudi Arabia and a Trump and now ... when he came in had these aren't these MBA agreed that the amendment step back with friends\nAnd he had been said back that hasn't been to lead to extreme politically now if Trump stuff's support thing and all that stuff that would be a guy and he's based on these things still be there and some of the money he got up and that's what will happen\nNow what's happening is Trump and the vices of the United states discovered that this guy could not be the king of Saudi Arabia at all\nBut John to avoid having to daddy and you know having to with from whatever I could even bet it did it that's why they\nJohn to avoid having to wait and you know having to with from whatever agreement that it did it that's why they are then it's got sort of think\nIt's gotten that needs to a less than ... you know pressure can be on TV because in this moment drunk and you can say it's not me it's been ... discovered in ... I still nice I've been following the economics we have but it's not me you know it's the Congress is that people who\nDon't like whatever you're doing you're I'm pressure to do that so that's what's happening\nSo you think that if Trump is making that move that's a signal that MBBS will if not immediately eventually he'll be pushed out of the succession to become king\nYeah based on the cutting given we don't know it's like I'm sure at gas is doing his back now to change the week but based on the cutting givens I'm quite sure that he would not be the next ...\nWhy is turkey show intent on this on on on exposing this story\nThere again so yeah they'd be has since they've at the end it flamed relationship historically a these are two big countries that you got to understand turkey and now they have the most I've got that ... or\nA president who believes in the glory of the oil to open an empire and they were the leaders of the ... or ... it's like a gun to their ... caliphate\nSo he believes this way and a sound yeah they'd be going towards the holiest a slam make a monument in gob or if you go to pay every\nLots of countries in the end and that might explain or to some states if it's in between so yeah they'd be and it often they needed that they should be the people to control and get that\nIran's government has been almost silence on this this ... case have you heard any comments from Iran\nNot much no Iran or hasn't said much about that but you know\nDoes that strike you as unusual that Iran would stay quiet on literally their arch enemy in the region\nAdam and I wouldn't say I knew it was with Iran is very smart and that will get the most leave it to or not and I would imagine they are just picking them back in a way\nThat's great from Egypt with the perspective on the very latest on the Saudi journalist who was killed in Turkey and don't forget turkey says on Tuesday there are going to unveil all the information from their investigation that they have\nNow time for our global media spotlight how foreign media coverage stories about America that are important to America certainly discussed Sochi case if you listen to European media in this case France corporate popular media France twenty four channel uh they certainly tie all of this right back to Donald Trump here's a portion of a program on voice to America\nAs seen from the New York times and not be not only and you say that I have seen watching how to cooperate\nAs things that have been coming out of the ... when when when we had initially about those Fifteen\nAt people that are that way at the touched down in Istanbul and then international news outlets didn't take long to be able to individually consigned themselves who the people who are not to say that none of this story a thing called right to say something about the technique releasing evidence as surrounding that audio files we haven't had that at least publicly yet but\nI think ... story we do know a train ...

Sherry not just doing what suitable for someone really was doing right being able to look at all areas in all parts of your finances\nAnd that is what we do have told us in financial we just don't focus on insurance product or we just don't focus on how much can we keep it in the market or life insurance\nWe truly are license to be able to evaluate every situation and be able to bring a blended in balance to one's portfolio that just isn't suitable but more important what's right\nFor them I'm impressed I just want you know that you impress me but I think that you know when it's not something you had to do to make your company really better you just wanted to do it for yourself so that you can go wherever you need to which you would do anyway so I ... I think it's cool I like you I'm impressed and I know now you're you're Steve junior that works for you you've got to be\nGoing my I've got to get going to get that you're highly\nSo we're talking about roll over say on the program and you know I think we've all probably heard of those have when you get ready to retire you got to roll this into that and\nWell the reason is why why do we have to do all of that so that's our topic today I think it's really an important one because it's one of the most overlooked but potentially beneficial maneuvers that you can make with your assets leading up to or even during your retirement and it's the roll over so we're gonna talk about some of these different roller maneuvers\nThat one performed at the right time\nThe right way and for the right reasons\nGood for you and your assets in a better position for retirement so I guess the first question that he's answering is what exactly is a roll over in a financial context\nMarket roll over as a term people in my business use to describe an active moving money or assets from one financial account or insurance product into another financial account or insurance products\nUsually it's some type of electronic transaction where a person or the financial or insurance professional who represents then specify that they want custody of that person's money or assets\nTo transfer from one entity to another and what we do is we struck the custodian that currently holds the money are assets to transfer the money into another custodian and that trend for typically occurs without\nAnd he holds the money are assets to transfer the money into another custodian and that trend for typically occurs without the account owner physically having to move that money or assets as just called direct roll over\nAnd that can help a person with some incredible benefits and we're going to explain that in a moment but there are some rules that we have to be careful that we wanted to make sure that we follow to have access to these benefits\nSo think about this back in two thousand two thousand one do you remember the dot com crash so at that time Steve was still working as a police officer with the city of Phoenix and he had a four fifty seven equivalent to a far away and I remember Mart and getting those statements in the mail and up until two thousand\nMan we were excited was really we we were looking\nGood I mean we just kept contributing and it just kept growing leaps and bounds we've pretty strong going into two thousand about how our four fifty seven at grown we started going through the dot com correction everybody said it would happen\nAt that time I wasn't working I was staying home with our kids 'cause that's what we chose to do and I remember getting that\nFirst envelope now this was really nice for people were was savvy a where you could go on line and check it I mean you basically waited for the state that\nHas a member mark opening that statement and being like holy cow oh we just lost tempers that in the next month\nWhat was it holy cow anymore it was holy moly and I don't know if that was the word but we're going on twenty ... it probably was\nYet before you know within like Ninety Days are counted gone down over thirty percent mark I would not even open the statement I Would simply leave it sealed and I put it in our book\nWhy because there was nothing that I could do we didn't want to be emotional we didn't want to pull it all out of the market because we had heard it'll come back and at that point that's all we could do well up until the age fifty nine and a half\nThat is for most choices what people have to do they just kind of have to ride it out because the worst time to make a big change in your portfolio is when the markets are correcting most people are making their emotional decisions at that time but what happens at fifty nine and a half\nIs it you have the ability with almost all companies do what's called an and
