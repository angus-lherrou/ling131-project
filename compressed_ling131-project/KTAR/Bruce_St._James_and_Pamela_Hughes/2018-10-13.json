story I'll tell you on the road I might just giving you that if you could have seen if we can in car cameras me probably only say it might have been around this time of year in Nineteen Ninety One that is Seventy six to ... he thought it was pretty cool you know\nDriving around and rainy day that was before they really you know I used to live up by taping greenway in before\nTatum is really four lanes all the way the bell wrote it used to kind of end and just kind of a little dog leg over and\nAnd a cruise long big old puzzle on the side of the the right side there and I hit that sucker and sure enough you would have thought that I just stood there for the fire hydrant ... that car I brought with me from Virginia I don't really pay much attention to those just drive and I didn't realize the floor board was rushed it out\nAnd when that water blasted on that right we'll when it's ... you know you can hear it on your regular car\nRushing through well that too easy is it really doesn't have much more than what amounts to a floor mat on on on the ground and there's not like the modern carpet where it's all molded in place\nI was drenched in water it was horrible I mean all the way to work and I'm just covered I mean I don't I was like what in the ... how did this come from what happened I didn't even think of any day\nAnd I got to work and there's I mean you can put like the Flintstones that could have had Barney and my passenger side to hit the brakes and battle with big all whole so I got some of that you know heavy duty plastic from Home Depot to that if we fix that sucker\nDuct tape it's an amazing tool that was the last time your hair got what did you ever hear back then yeah I think a lot of some hair back then All right more years after that ten years or so for sure\nWell the phones are starting to come in at six so to to seven seven five eight to seven or we're going to go with Tammy in may says she's got a two thousand and six Pontiac grand prix how can we help you Tammy you're on bumper to bumper radio\nCurious when I turned on my right ... my mind\nAnd that was not playing that they're so\nWow have you did this just suddenly start one day yeah does it blink\nYeah it brings in the hiring and it's only in my right sort of my life around him I don't mind\nIf I had it right if I had to throw it dark I mean this would be a wild guess um I Would say that multi functions which is going bad you know could you write light is right in there and you're blink or is right in there maybe a little cross contamination going on inside that switch\nYeah there yeah that's what I Would be looking at now is this something Tammy related to rain or is this something that's been happening for a while\nThey're happening are lap probably about the animals last year\nHa ha and then to both headlights come on or is it just the same size as the turn signal\nDie just tonight right but both high beams yeah do they ...\nOkay yeah I mean I Do in the dark to wall that some of the ... what needs to happen the way they shop is going to diagnose that and figure it out and it could be easy that could be one of those nightmares or you just you don't know what this can of worms is going to open up up into it may be nothing\nBut you got to really look at a wide net game that's the road map and you've got to look and trace it out figure how can the action of turning this wiper switch on or this person a switch back feed to this had light bulbs could be a multi functions which\nDay we've had all kinds of weird problems with light bulbs with the one element dragged over and and and that we had a Hyundai the other day where the brake labeled the element in one of 'em broke and it was back feeding every time you step on the brakes carpets though\nBack feeding into the computer just weird weird things even from a light bulb so Tammy good luck with that may so you can find a couple of different bumper to bumper shops out there if you don't have a good shot to take your car to\nYou know it's funny that you know people talk about their you know hear people talk about the ...\nAnd you know people talk about their you know people talk about the cause of the time we have this one car interest had electrical grumbling didn't you know ... how many times have you heard that standard chalk it up yeah and uh there there isn't really electrical ... I mean there can be when it's some weird problem like you said some light bulb can create some were back feeding a voltage and all that stuff\nBut uh you know when people tell us these stories immediately in our brain we're just connecting things how could that be connected to that you know we we have a problem solving mode\nFirst charge disease in what we mean by the multi functions which sets a switch where you know when you hit the blink or that goes into a switch in the steering column that does all those things that it does really old days you had to push button on the floor works at a high beams ... you don't see that anymore\nYou know that's the secret a kill switch nowadays parishioner thanks for the call it\nThe Emmy six though to to seven Seventy five eighty seven we're going to go with Martin in Phoenix he's got a two thousand and ten GMC Sierra how can we help you do Sierra Iran bumper to bumper radio\nYeah I'm Talking to you I'm I've got two thousand tense a\nCity and I have trouble with the uh what the idol on this thing 'cause I can do a lot of times when I slow down all a break and when they hit the brakes the idol wants to go up\nAnd then the idol will do that for a while that all the breakdown\nShoot for work\nAnd then my old down for a second or two it idol back down to about ... rpm which probably about normal\nAnd it does that a lot a you know especially after ... after I wrote for a while I'll slow down and uh if I throw that they in neutral I can see the ... and go up as high as ... Fifteen hundred\nDrop back down to six I once I start slowing down a complete stop what about the um you know a throw it or neutral it goes up and it comes back down and then I hit the right to put it back in Dr\nDaley you know in in Myrtle that I I don't I don't think that we've got a real complicated problem here no I think as soon as the brakes affect the idol I'm thinking of the breakfast or see\nI'm going I'm going really related yeah\nYeah the other way ... I'm I'm think well\nYou don't think we got a vacuum week there yeah I I kind of could go there but I'd be looking at the ... to\nYou know a lot of times those things just get ... that's a that's a thought a bio wire so um yeah I mean if you step on the break there is a change and vacuum potentially on the engine\nAnd if that's rather blade that that's electronic step blade is just opening and closing to allow the ... ... a desired amount of air into the engine and if that's gummed up and not properly calibrated\nThat very well could cause that just can't react fast enough and you get those surging hum\nBut then again could be ... today you do see very many boosters go out on the Chevy or GMC Truck so\nYeah I Know what you know in my in my mind that's kind of like the old school thinking you know back in the ... would have been a common problem but I Do kind of think that you know 'cause I Know sometimes you know you could just have\nYou know the front of body and you know an idle issue there but also\nBreak this can be a problem yeah and the cure for that sometimes is um well really the test for the cure is with might just take a rag Wissam solve it didn't open up the roller blade and manually clean that out there that oftentimes is some cars there's idle relearn procedure\nWe would do that and then it must be confirmed if that in fact did or did not fixing the car then we might finish the job was doing the whole induction system clean or something like that but if we went down the wrong road then we started\nPlugging off lines going to a break boosted this the methodical way to diagnose that for sure well thanks for the call Martin and we've got Glen Bob read it in check and what have room for more than six so to to seven seven five eight to seven who

soon as you realize I Need to get some work done in my car\nI'm sure that thought occurred to you that you're about to get taken for a ride I used to share the same sentiment and wondering if the shop is going to make something up and have me spending hundreds of dollars instead of thirty I was planning on first simple oil change\nIt's just one of the reasons that will only go to good works out of our parents because I trust them putting trust in an auto shop didn't come easily it's been built over several visits with them doing exactly what was needed ... to unnecessary work ask them for an oil change and the safety inspections they do just that\nTo keep that in mind for sure\nLet's go with Rita in may so she has a two thousand and two Nissan Alton the how can we help to reading your on bumper to bumper radio\nGuy I'm a handle on my back door of the car have come on and I wanted to know who might be that the fact that\nNow do you say that is it the outside door handles his theory or hit\nOut side door handle\nAt all my and that's one of those repairs like literally I had a I had a car in my shop here a couple of weeks ago in the interior door handle was broken and so this person literally for a year would roll the windows down open the door and the role of window backup\nFor a hundred and Seventy five dollars I could you not the part was\nTwenty three dollars and so uh we had done a transmission repair so we went ahead and took care of it just is like a courtesy like hey by the way to fix the door handles after all your window down to open your door\nTo door handles break the handles or plastic anymore and they just get old and brutal and then they break and it's not a major repair uh the body shop certainly can handle that as well but I Know mad at your shop you would handle something like that and\nThe bigger challenge comes is when some of these handles calming or painted door you know their their body color\nSo I mean we've done sons have you know where the the mirror comes in it's\nYou know maybe you got a white card and all of a sudden you've got one might mirror and one black man well I've had people just say just put two New Years on and then I then I have an issue magazine\nOr the you know Mad Men circle matching mirrors but you know and sometimes those things come loose they can be tightened up I you know I doubt that will just put mine back on chances are\nUm you might need a new door handles but not a big deal for any shop to take care of\nFor sure you're in may so go ahead and give the guy's a campus body salon if you're looking for somebody to do that for you let's go with Chuck in Scottsdale he's got a two thousand and one Ford Expedition how can we help you check your on bumper to bumper\nRadio Oh hi guys I'm happened I I'm battery problem\nA it's a it's a second vehicle and it sits most of the time but uh I just put him up at the battery such twenty Fifteen oh and this time I had to put in in a July ... the oil change place because you know I've been using a a\nA a booster packed to just you know get it going if if the battery said it took it in there and I said hey you know what's going on with my battery what's what's the problem and they\nThey said well hey your batteries don't go we we we can give you a new one where we can sell you a new one with a three year warranty\nLosers in July ... so I thought well great great so uh last week I took a took the\nExpedition up to north Scottsdale to go to breakfast and coming out of breakfast it wouldn't start and uh it was a big problem for me well that's the only way I ended up\nI ended up back at the uh uh after getting a charge back at the uh all change place and they they they ran a check on the battery and it was a bad battery and then he said you know you have an alternate are probably have some kind of an issue because literally the ... the ... the trucking only gone three hundred and eighty one miles since July\nUm and so he he took he hoped the battery while it was still running after they charge it up and it kept going he said well I don't think it should only take a short period of what did he replace the battery\nDaemon I are going to fight with David I are fighting over who's gonna who's going to tell you that you are in play here the wrong\nPlaces they're doing that for an alternate tests and that yeah that is that is not the way to do that you could do that back in Nineteen eighty five you know I ended up having more church let's see if the alternate his work and pull the battery case a cable off in the driveway but\nIt was the manager what am I right now I don't know I\nGet that managers doing training the young guys I can\nI get it in so uh that needs to be checked out by somebody who's who's good with good with the electrical system can can really look at what's going on as far as\nDo we have a ... a draw because you're going through a lot of batteries maybe something's discharging the battery a that's a possibility this other one didn't sound like it's a key after our problem 'cause you're driven up the north Scottsdale from ...\nScott do from ... whenever you're at in a in ... click and nothing you know nothing work and so there's more going on there that somebody's just missing the source because I get news in a battery after Fifteen months that's an unusual that happens but you know I think he said like like\nEight and ... says two thousand Fifteen definitely too many in thinking about do you have any after market accessories or is the ... you know go out in the garage at nighttime went totally dark and see if you've seen the globe coming out of the glove box I've had have had had cars with the\nThe um you know the love locks light on day I had a car where people say their alarm would go off in the middle of the night\nUh you know the the door locks which is and I know those expeditions have that problem too that the door locks which is part of the latch so that's in case we may just be thrown on the interior lights you could have something like that I've seen cars with radar detectors I mean years ago we had a pilot\nHad a Porsche nine forty four ... every time he got a county come back to the airport is car was dead we had a built in radar detector they'd be gone for four days at a time that radar detectors is going nuts for four days every time to kill the battery he could park it at home never had the problem only at the airport\nLike two three or four weeks if you think do all this crazy is I Will\nCheck the other thing is I think to check his didn't always
