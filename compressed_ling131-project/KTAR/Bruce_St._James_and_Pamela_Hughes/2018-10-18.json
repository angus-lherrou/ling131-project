ago and it was the end of the world as we know there's ... famously saying but I feel fine when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court we were told that this would be the thing that's turns and election there was going to be a wave people voting and it would fundamentally change things\nIf that is true why nobody talking anymore it as a matter of fact maybe the best example of that is Democrats the people you would think would have been the most up in arms avenged cabin or whatever at the at the midterm elections\nAre not talking about the Supreme Court talking about health care yeah health care\nRight now the number one\nAre not talking about the Supreme Court\nYou're talking about health care\nYeah health care right now the number one issue as the midterms approach\nAbout like two and a half weeks away and when you're looking at what is the top issue number one hobby voted all are concerned about\nIt is health care and now when you also go down the list healthcare comes in and number one mhm I'm I'm\nTrying to see here that that uh okay uh this is ... you know who you're voting for Congress healthcare number one is the top issue very important the economy and jobs\nNumber to mix and by the way that's probably a traditional right\nGun policy number three you know the the actual to vote on guns but that seems a little high to me to be honest with you again\nOr a voters show up to vote pro Second Amendment much more than me we want to call him anti so I can remember gun control people joke but I just think gun\nPolicy in general being the third top issue just seems hide to me like an immigration comes in\nFor you you and you see gun policy him look but but think about the conversation we have after these mass shootings when everybody's enraged in Florida and I mean you know\nYeah I understand but we haven't had one of those mass shootings in a long time so for it to be number three\nSo so people are only of this plan to point my point though ... ... the thing that is going to motivate them to vote above all else is something that we couldn't do before the election\nWell I mean healthcare hasn't happened in a week or two before the election I think that in a packed you on a regular basis I run policy doesn't impact on a daily immigration doesn't impact you on a daily basis\nYou know depending on where you live and what you do you can make an argument one way or the other the economy does so health care coming in number one isn't shocking but okay great I got it autonomy number two short gun policy number three still is odd

completely crushed by student loan debt to completely owning it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it is even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAnother planet so I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later in the final payment\nYeah you paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years mhm Minnesota rate you were on which is pretty incredible\nBut you're making four Fifteen modest taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now are you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and just completely lean to show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing\nWhen you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty month only given month at what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in more you before the before kind of the switch kind of flipped for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest lands first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so I was able to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that and then I started to have\nSome more hope that I Would be able to pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there is no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking 'em off the little baby ones when you first started yeah\nAnd that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf and it was that snowball really kicked in for you then they did what he was supposed to do it let you know that this was going to work mhm wow wow wow wow wow wow All right so what is the big takeaway when someone says\nOh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is\nJust to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get to that and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers balloons you know I Need to get myself out and then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change\nOr your parents' good with money um\nGet myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money and they are their income as much less sugar than what mine is but I learned most people's\n[laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card that in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card and um you know make sports for purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know there was a there was a sense of character that came from them that they cause you'll be able to do this that's what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your
