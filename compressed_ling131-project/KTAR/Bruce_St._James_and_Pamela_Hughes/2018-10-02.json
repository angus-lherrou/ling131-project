drank in high school possibly to excess okay up not disqualifying for me to be a a Supreme Court or nothin' or senator or people do things in high school and college um and drinking alcohol even under age\nIt happens sure he is he ... he is currently Brett Kavanaugh is a district court judge federal judge in Washington DC at one of the most important districts or is he is up for\nA Supreme Court for a lifetime appointment he sort of told the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and there is I think at least evidence that\nHe lied under oath I don't care if he lied about what do you have for lunch I've said this and here's the consistency part the typical for people my problem with Bill Clinton is he lied under oath\nWell he lied about sex I got to be about the stock he lied under oath if the president\nIf a judge if a congressman doesn't have to tell the truth under oath it undermines the entire system that we have I hold them to a higher standard\nIf he is found to have lied about any of this I don't care what he lied about for me the issue is like a judge can't be caught lie\nYou know when you go to work at the White House ah I have friends who have done that\nAnd they will routinely ask you about your current or previous ... years\nOkay something that has become quite common today's day and just say you made it all the way through without burned by answering yes that you smoke pot at some point in time and your life it doesn't negate your ability to serve at the White House\nDidn't want to know how you're going to answer tough questions are you going to tell the truth and it comes down to the truth especially when you were a judge and you were sitting on a bench and you are expecting people to raise the right hand and under oath to tell the whole

front of you to a higher standard than you would hold yourself again it is a fundamental issue it's why I think Bill Clinton\nA disgrace the office of the presidency by lying under oath again don't care that he lied about having to not have sexual relations that woman that is a lie you are a liar he was this barred and the state of Arkansas why for lying under oath if Brett Kavanaugh lied under oath\nTo the Senate he should be kicked off of the bench in Washington DC and not confirmed the Supreme Court\n[noise] this is in a campaign that he is running this is one of the only institution that

serious consequences\nIn other words people are not being convicted on false rape accusation there is a process we go through there are investigations and determine who's telling the truth\nEven ten percent do if you're going to hell with the high aspects of that that means that Ninety percent\nArt falls\nOkay thank you for doing them out for me on that yes Ninety percent or so is it is it typical ... but this is a narrative and this is what\nYou have Trump trying to spin right now that this is just a ... in his words angry Hillary loving Dems are upset about the election attacking white Republican men right\nIsn't that what they're saying is that that this is all driven by politics that these women are making ... accusations are testifying under oath and lying perjuring themselves are are putting forward um and starting investigations knowing that they're making it all [noise]\nI it's right at turns my stomach it absolutely turns my stomach when we're seeing what's happening in this country right now it's no\nOkay the copious on this one that that's not even remotely credible accusation that the that she thinks there might have been something in the punch\nShe thinks that she saw\nHim with a red so low cup and is giving it to women and she thinks he was near the punch so therefore he was drugging women to try to have sex with like you you can't make\nThat leap so you can't make that leap cigarette they're inconsistencies torn between her store sworn statements and what she said in the interview last night\nI think that it is not as credible as Christine Blasey Ford but I Would also go back Bruce\nTo the she's asking for an FBI investigation she has asked for an FBI investigation Michael ... says that she's offered to take a polygraph test and meet with the FBI and be cross examined by Kevin ... lawyers if you're making this out of whole cloth if this is false why do you go to that length well\nAnd this was this one makes me suspicious she strikes me as suspicious again you have to watch their testimony you look at body language you look how the answer I I Believe Dr Ford\nDo not believe her she hasn't convinced me she able to convince me that she has a story to tell she she has a story that is loosely involved with Brett Kavanaugh she cannot put him in a compromising or disqualifying position she merely puts them in the ZIP Code\nHere's where it doesn't have as much weight as Christine Blasey Ford did did this did this all happened I don't know no this is I don't know the case with Christine Blasey Ford when I got the declaration from Julie sweat neck and I read it there are some\nDamaging accusations that are being made in here and agreed and and it's written and raping thing you pointed it out when when it first got released last week I think it was Wednesday of last week that\nYou got to be able to backed us up I mean there there was a lot of legal speak and very carefully very carefully chosen okay that's what you hire attorneys to do I get it\nSo in your own words when you hear somebody in their own words describe the accusations the two things are lining up with one another for instance\nIn her statement she says I have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside of rooms that many of these parties waiting for their turn with a girl inside the room these boys included mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh but we don't boys lined up outside of a room doesn't equate gang rape\nThe reason why she she makes the accusation of gang rape because she says she was a victim of one of the gang or train rapes where these two men were president not him\nI'm\nIn this interview last night [noise] she said the boys that these parties were not lined up but I don't buy the doors\nAnd paints a very different image for me it's vague\nListen I'm Glad that there's being an FBI and whether there's an FBI investigation is being conducted because people who are trained and that's going to ask these questions and assume that the the statements to the Senate Judiciary committee\nAnd that's what should happen her testimony is so far doesn't hold a lot of weight with me and I understand that just doesn't hold water way\nThat doesn't mean I don't believe all women it doesn't mean I Believe all women it means I Believe credible when I was I Believe credible occupants accusations I don't find her accusations very credible\nAt least not linking judge Kavanaugh to a potential crime [noise]\nI'm I'm the only one is a high schoolers family suing the school and we get to talk about soccer I'm so

a checkered a credit history pack\nYeah I read the people will trigger pass all the time I'm I'm worried about their future and handed it to the extent that they are past as an indicator of their future you don't rent to them if they got an ugly past\nBut a lot of the others are those stupid stuff in the past the question is are we still on that road and they don't like around in this case all three of them are at least making some level of effort\nTo learn how to handle money and not be in the mouse anymore the financial peas university certificates that's pretty cool I never thought about man go through after you maybe\nI should do that [laughter] well\nNo it's really interesting though because they all volunteer that information on their applications and they're all very proud of that I Know\nWell I'm going to interview them and what I'm trying to figure out is two things is there anything in their past this going to come up and tackle them like if they got an outstanding judgment that's getting ready to seize all of their income and they wouldn't be able to pay the rent\nOr something like that is there something in the past that's looming\nThat even though they've changed it it's going to still tackled them from behind okay\nSo that that one I'm going to try to ascertain and then thing too is and I think it's just an interview process and um we many times I differ required financial bridge and versus niggers meals do but that is I should have done it but I'm a we many times have asked them for a budget\nOkay that's an indicator of how they can pay if they're if they're if the grads their donut budget and let's see you know we are looking at their income to rent ratio and um you know if if one of these guys what\nIs the guidelines for the income what percentage\nWell what we tell folks in it for you is to not take out anything more than a fourth of your take home pay right gotcha\nUm how can they survive but more than that yeah they can survive it more than that and again I Want to hear the story around the income you know they just started the job and you know maybe their incomes going to be going up dramatically in the next two years away and\nSo I have I have that they're protective pants on\nThe on the low and I have a sixty five hundred dollar per month verified income and then I have on the high end ... uh twelve thousand wow I'm terrified income and um\nSo I Am kind of leaning towards that the higher income with no pets yeah versus and said that the lower income just for for our security\nYeah I mean I ... and again if that's if they don't have an eight hundred dollar car payment or something I got to know what else is in the mix the whole story but all things being equal\nYeah that's the direction I Want to see that they've got the room the ability and they're not going to be tackled from behind and then you just talking to them and ask pertaining have they really learn their lesson and they really turned the corner heading back the other way I don't really give a real if they file bankruptcy two years ago at that point because\nIf they're trying to change change their lives they change their life you know I'm fine with that at all I'm concerned about Greenland\nYou and we'll you and are you prone to pay the freaking rent that's what I'm concerned about you know\nExactly exactly now I really appreciate that and I just thought that it was so ironic that was all on their applications and I said you know what I was going to call Dane and he has he got to know attorney\nSo all you people are trying to
