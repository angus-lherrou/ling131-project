Tony Tony how\nThat's going to go out of Israel to get us started on this edition of voice of America our next stop all the Iran\nWe will also go down to Brazil and talked to a first time voice about their election day and is it another one of these changes hard situations for the largest country and one of the largest economies in the world certainly the largest\nCountry in that continent and we are seeing what we've been seeing for a long time now never forget or two years ago if you are a long time listener to this program you'll remember that we were talking to folks of course outside the United states about our elections this was when it was down to Hillary and it was down to Donald Trump\nAnd uh we had several people that were telling us we're outside the United states Trump will win and I certainly didn't expect Trump to win\nAnd I was questioning them and say you know why why do you say that what do you think that and uh they said because it's already been happening here you know so it it that that's always that that always resonates with me and it's easy to get distracted by that and to think you know if it's not happening to me if I haven't had that experience\nOr than it there's no way it can be true I Can't imagine it I'm not creative enough I Can't expand my mind enough to understand that something different may be happening but they were explaining of course you know breakfast had happened six months earlier for instance across Europe\nAnd in some of the smaller European nations not just you know France and Germany\nOr they had seen this this uprising of these of of parties are just the radical change that the fake changed not the nonsense that had been you know the ... been passed off as your previous generation of you know oh we're a change agent we're going to come in here are really changing that of course we all know it was just more of the same\nAnd they had seen it you\nKnow the United states likes to uh oftentimes think that you know they again they invent everything they started everything they're the they're the vanguard of everything a and then often times that is true\nBut not always and this was the perfect case uh\nSo we're gonna we're gonna go back and we're going to find out some more as we find out what's going on with the Trump of the tropics and if it is comparable and if we are going on the cusp of seeing nothing's official yet the polls are open as we speak if we were going to see something similar to breakfast or Trump\nOr going on in in Brazil and of course what it could or could not mean uh for this uh this anti establishment real change a movement\nOr an update and we will have more than one of our global media spotlights about the care of and moving from Central America ups to the United states southern border\nAnd it was a story that we talk to Caesar from Honduras about last week if you missed it I encourage you to listen to it because by all indications this is where this caravan was a strong word began\nA and the it was in Honduras as we speak right now by again all indications are that it's a it it's still in Mexico still quite a ways away from the United states southern border but there are lots of obvious questions because the politicians and the activists the organizers they're basically all politicians\nAre we have to ask obvious questions you know how does a caravan start how does a caravan become a caravan\nHow is the caravan organized to the extent that they can get up in March literally for days or weeks if they make it up to the United states but whose sustaining them who's organizing them who's feeding them who's offering them security how does that happen in that of course the obvious questions to\nWe've got these governments whether it's the Hungarian government whether it's the Mexican government whether it's the American government they all claim\nThat they've got immigration policies they all claim that they've got security that is reputable\nAnd ah then ... you know we see them say something and then on the ground for all practical purposes it doesn't reflect the rhetoric of course it they're saying so we all play this game where we we've learned relatively quickly you know if indeed it's a situation where you know some person says I'm trying to seek political asylum\nIf you live in a country that you know open and respects human rights you know the idea is that if somebody says I Need asylum\nThat first country of entry is supposed to be you know the the the the place where asylum is granted but just you know we get we all talk about it we go to the United nations is about the United nations says this or\nYou know ... there's all these organizations that are formed it's nice and they've all got names and they've all got your decrees and they've all got their constitutions and then the reality on the ground is often in life is far from what everybody talks about in polite circumstances in air conditioned to ... officers in arenas and so this is the case here but\nTo update you Mexico\nThey do have a plan and the outgoing president that's an ... opinion yet he's got a one month month and a half left ... roughly before a a Lopez Obrador comes in a he says that\nAbout a month month and a half left ... roughly before a Lopez Obrador comes in a he says that of course you know we have a ... we've got a plan and we've got we're ... we're listening to Donald Trump of course do not just Donald Trump or listening to his all trips as look\nYou've got to do this or moving through your country we know that they want to come here we ... what kind of security do you have and what kind of\nPlan do you have for these people that many of them are claiming that you know their their lives are in jeopardy or down in in in Honduras it's not just an economic issue so today we find out about the arrest us into Costa which is the this is your home in Spanish\nAnd that is what a pain in yet to comes up and says he says that\nFor those who comply with Mexican laws and stay in the southern part of Mexico do keep moving to the central part of the northern they got to stay in the south of Mexico offer temporary ID cards and work permits medical care schooling for children the migrants children's and housing and local hostile\nAnd uh that's that's the plan\nOf course the obvious question is is what if it has rejected I mean what if the ... the caravan says ... you don't understand and they've said this\nUh your plan is to go to the United states so we're just going to use your country is a highway to move all the way through not a small country ... not a small country and so they're already there they'd been there for many days they play it I just keep moving through the ... what do you do if they don't take the plane\nYou didn't send them back to Honduras you pushed them forward to the United states or did you come up with another plane again that's what's awesome about all of this ... who's in control is the president in control\nOr is the caravan and control\nAnd that's the fault of that goes on all the time especially with the immigration issue on America's southern border that's the update there you have it will continue to follow this and you'll hear more on this program coming up\nIn one of our global media spotlight tell foreign media popular corporate media covered the story and uh I think you'll probably find it interesting if you're interested in this story next stop Iran the curious ... the United states now says\nIt may be a game changer for the middle east to America where the world comes to jog [noise]\nContacting isn't affordable solution for driving revenue in creating brand awareness millions of people listen to pod

find out what a camera and things from Iran I chatted with a ripe for the program and I started by asking him what the reaction has been in Iran if anything to this ... case\nThough they are not a comment on that off the show the thought K hon a newspaper would represent the hotline this and he's on a had a actually a very cynical or this bonds may be true\nAnd the way they had this Suzie at IBM flag and they took that to symbols and they put a a chain saw on that and that is the funniest and and the same type hard that is a response from Iraq\nToday in Bahrain the American secretary of defense said that if it's proven that the Saudi Government was behind the killing of of cars so gee\nI'm that it could destabilize the entire Middle East does that sound like a politician using hyperbole or do you think\nThere's something to those words\nI kind of a ... the ... is that we live in the middle east but I think it would\nIt would ah puts the fuse question mark on to\nThe idea in ten cents in in the in the region I think that it would damage the is trapped in the partnership between Iran and is said and and United States\nI think that if they are proven that they will be hand especially if the U.S is the end it they would ... the back and ... when it comes to\n... does anybody by the Saudi explanation about what happened in Istanbul a couple of weeks ago because even the Saudis explanation keeps changing\nAnd no they are not a day or making fun of food yeah that'd be a day are saying that that\nKeeps changing [noise] no they are not a day or making fun of food yeah that'd be a day are saying that that this is a pat down that the sci fi or when you are S.

I think that this new one\nOr the the father is obviously sick and they cannot do anything but his son NBS I think he thinks that the role of the wall because um because of the economy power that they have a lot and he take actions that is\nA that this kind of a unimaginable how could you be king of the country and then\nI I agree with such a plan I ... or or dyslexic flat and it was just this is a tough guy and there's a duck his way\nAnd of course the question that everybody is asking because this is the this is what we may or may never know but it's it's kind of the obvious question that everybody asked is\nThere any way in a country like Saudi Arabia the leader he's not officially king but for all practical purposes for the last year or two he's been the the day to day you know leader of Saudi Arabia is there any way NBS would not have known about an operation like this\nI think for a for American public sitting in a in in being getting us may bees or something to think that he's not responsible maybe somebody else\nOr that this but for Middle East and like me and for somebody who is monitoring the human rights not just in the heat on but also in other countries I Would tell you that is absolutely impossible and nonsense to think\nThat anybody that ensued yet I've you would take this kind of accent retires ah\nAn sent to think that anybody that ensued yeah that you would take this kind of accent retires ah highest person annoying and and to be honest with you\nIf you knew how do those up right this is a very very clear a accent that they would take to Thailand or the opposition so it did\nThis has been this kind of things has been done in the middle east for at least last fifty years Iran is in the same time his mask that out of doing Iran has done\nSimilar things but there is absolutely no way that ensued yeah that'd be or eat on somebody would take this accent as Supreme indeed the MPs is not know of it when I'm not a sponsor what\nA camera and what ... what is turkey during what does it say angle and all of this 'cause they're very aggressive and exposing or at least their side of the story and going after Saudi Arabia\nCooking is playing chess and they are doing it so well they are like mass escape\nYeah what do they want the what is it what is it what are they going to use all these cards for\nIt I think it comes\nTo what the government wanting to be in the middle east and how that food yeah that you want to play that role I think is the\nIs high enough that the competition between the leaders of Islamic world one one of the Islamic world and the other one leader of Islamic for them so the idea is claiming to\nThat's camera for Iran with analysis of what's going on with the ... association the broader Middle East and of course the recent comments from our secretary of state from the United states when we return we've got change is hard to top the our and our FIRST Global media spotlight next on the Central American caravan [noise]\nBoys to America where the world comes to John [noise]\nFinancial education isn't taught in most schools and our children are drastically unprepared for the financial world that awaits them\nNow they're self busy kid is the only option where kids can complete shores to from\nSave share spend and invest real allowance busy kid helps parents establish important financial routines in their kids along with a sense of what it means to be responsible and financially smart for\nKids five just sixteen busy kid motivates and encourage them to make actual decisions when their money as parents oversee the process\nPhysic it provides families a fun new way to approach chores and allow us tall wall teaching important financial lessons get started today at ... dot com forward slash BEK that's B.

V. depends on their representation in Congress\n[noise] so what's happened is that for ... particular he's tied on TV was white quite small\nSo he was almost you know only ... you know it was already ... he had he had limited options because of the laws so he turned to social media\nDo just my interpretation and working happens and it's working for him about money and we've now come on TV and he tried to do was to move to Internet and it's we're in a street we're pretty well\nYeah does it does it indicate that he has a wide variety of people in Brazil I mean ... large demographics that are supporting him yeah actually\nIf you look at the there is any progress very very informative or from resident newspapers\nWho shows that he pretty much one in from in the south south east and\nThe middle of the country and he lose your loss in in the first from in the north east so basically he had been more educated people more well people while\nThe the second Kennedy and have you know the bottom of the pyramid economically speaking and those that are less educated as well\nWhy do you think that what he campaigned on or at least some of the rhetoric that he has used was only for campaign purposes\nHe does have this or to do that is just ... leave that he's not going to do that because most of these and how can they say and people who are voting for him\nAnd those who work with these beliefs in terms of per se is or any kind of you know and last of democracy that we have seen and having being I mean the the increase of democracy we had a ... ... ... so then I mean he we will have a\n... from the east side\nSo I said you know what I mean people are voting for him not the cause of team just [noise]\nBut because of the change [noise]\nThat's the least Ricardo from Brazil first time voice on the voice of America program on the elections that are underway as we speak right now when you hear the same thing everywhere you go around the globe people are voting because they want change not the fake changed not the people that talk about changing it it's it's almost similar to the very end when I when I was shocked to try to understand\nIt's like it's not that people are so thrilled with both in our our son says this thrilled with what he says or how we are 'cause it's like what else are we going to do [noise] and when you look at the level of corruption and the law changes that have been going on just the last three or four years the economic situation and the security situation\nYou understand how we arrive America where we have ... comes to John [noise]\nFinancial education isn't taught in most schools and our children are drastically unprepared for the financial world wakes them\nNow they're self busy kid is the only option where kids can complete chores to from save share spent editing fast real allowance busy kid helps parents establish important financial routines in their kids along with a sense of what it means to be responsible and financially smart for\nKids five to six team busy kid motivates and encourage them to make actual decisions with their money as parents to oversee the process physic\nIt provides families a fun new way to approach chores and allowing tall wall teaching important financial lessons get started today at ... dot com forward slash BEK that's B.

financial planning will give me the phone number of the website and all of that\nTo get in touch with Stephanie but today we're going to tackle a topic that nobody really likes to talk about and that is\nWill you be OK really if if you could say the bread winner passes because that's typically how it works out but not at all situations so really we're going to talk about the challenges of losing a spouse and certainly there is emotional challenges but there's also financial challenges so this is a very important show\nNot one that we we'd like to talk about well you know it's important for you to hear about this oh Stephanie before we get into all that and walk into the show how are things that forwards and financial\nWell things are fabulous we got some maize in leather going on here and I look forward to our show today mark\nSo really you're only challenges not stepping on scorpions at this point\nThat clay exactly familiar story in the last year we've had about five in our house including one this last week so yes you're right my biggest challenge right now is not getting bit by a scorpion\nBut your husband's former police officer now of course part of the ... and financial me doesn't just pull out of service revolver and shoot him\nAnd just the way no\nNo I got a call that grandson and for the rest skill he gets a scorpion killer\nBut he likes that he does he does young Shiloh what does he five now yes turned five so there you go you\nGot your own animal pest control person Shiloh ready to take care of any things that\nAnything that Stephanie ... grandson shallow ready to come in so you know I always think that this was a very tough topic to talk about because\nStephanie I Know the you know when you work in the pre retirement world and the retirement world and it's not a short term it's not like people come into forwards and financial and say hey would you sell me the stock when you show me this annuity\nAnd that's the end of the relationship that's not it it's about coming up with an entire plan for your clients retirement you know getting them to retirement\nThen through retirement and that could be sure it could be five years but it more than likely might be twenty to thirty plus right so you build relationships with their clients I Would imagine this was one of the more difficult things\nAnd we all know it's going to happen to all of us at some point we're not going to be here any more art or into time will come but this has got to be an emotional time we're having a plan in place certainly helps your clients but how do you handle that aspect of your job\nNot well I tell you we do become so attached to our clients um you're right we spend a lot of time when they're both living you know planning and I'm adjusting as we need to adjust they I think about just recently\nWe got a phone call that we don't like we lost one of our dear clients they have been clients a virus since two thousand\nEight two thousand nine actually I remember when her urban Eleanor came into my office and they sat down and they were retired\nUh they had been retired for a few years they weren't our clients at the time but when they came in\nThey were in dire straits because they had seen\nTheir retirement accounts go in half with that they could just add that we had back in the financial crisis back in the late to thousands\nAnd I remember sitting across the table and Steve was sitting there with a with us at the time and market just broke my heart to just sit there devastate and they're crying like we don't know what to do it you know this is all we've got we've got to make sure that it lasts for\nThe rest of our life you know ill help and um\nAnd what to do it you know this is all we've got we've got to make sure that it lasts for the rest of our life you know he'll help and um I just remembered the desperation\nI remember them saying we don't want to have to go back to work we don't want to run out of money Steven I began working with him and and sure enough we we got them out of the market at that point and we did some strategies and\nBegan to create a platform they gave them some I Wonder if they kind of like a peace of mind knowing that they were going to be okay and we've lived life with and since then we've seen them get older we said in them you know have to make decisions going into a nursing home our existence care and\nThat were widowed or not married or what have you because of that social interaction because one of the things to living along live is having a great social interaction with other people and so maybe that's part of why she works with forward with financial because he likes the people that are there too it's a it's a time to go in and you know it's not all work twenty four seven\nBut it's a lot of work obviously for the financial what does she enjoys the people that she's there with\nOh my goodness we have so many great relationships that she's made with our clients that I mean she's she's so cute I mean she has them over to her house and teaches them how to I don't know like ... things or play bongo like this\nNext week I think we've got fourteen ladies coming into our office door an office hours we're not playing but my mother mother in law got these ladies come in there playing ball go women love that about our moms here at our company because it's more than just coming in and someone telling you need to do that do this\nThey actually come in and we both relationships with them and that's it and that's important because when you do find yourself becoming a widow it does become lonely mark all of a sudden all of those years by my in laws have been married for almost forty years and my mother in law found herself\nAll of a sudden waking up with nobody to her side\nSo relationships are so important and and again that's another reason why people love working with us here at ... financial so right now I Want to make sure that you have the opportunity to call in on our show and take advantage of a free\nConsultation it's completely customize to your situation what we will do is we will over look everything that you have we want to take a look at\nRisk you know what happens if these markets correct especially if your retirement we want to be able to maximize every dollar to be there for retirement so take a look at that when do you take Social Security\nIs a big topic right now a lot of changes even coming in two thousand Nineteen that over the next few weeks will be discussing the changes that will be seen in Social Security when should you take it\nShould you extend it to Seventy or should you take it at sixty six most important them do you understand the plan that should be put in place if not on how and when you lose a spouse that life doesn't change for you financially that you do not have to worry about not having enough money I Would say mark\nOn my the percentage is so high of\nPeople that come in and their biggest concern number one is still with money right now to live in retirement but I Would say the next biggest concern as if something happens to me will my spouse be okay that is an important question have answered\nWhy not pick up the phone right now for the next ten callers at eight hundred nine four seven nine five to two that number again is eight hundred\nNine four seven nine five to two and we will give you a free no obligation no pressure whatsoever so why wouldn't you want this at eight hundred nine four seven nine five two to eight customize retirement plan\nYou know another thing stuff but I think it would be a great thing to offer today and I'm sure you may say sorry I Can't because that that is priceless you can put a price on that and that is your book\nLiving a happy healthy and
