dollars completely destroying something rather than spend ten dollars to keep from doing the wrong thing it just drives me bananas I Can't stand it Josh is with us in Chicago hey Josh how are you\nA day if I'm doing great how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um well my wife and I of and struggling for a few years to figure out how we should educate our kids um we'd love for them to be taught from a Christian perspective\nBut at the same time we love to pay off our house and um so we're not sure what the best movers and if it's financially responsible to do one\nOr the other and I wanted to get your opinion [noise]\nUm well I mean\nA Christian school is a private school and there's going to be more expensive and then the question you've got to say is if we go that route it pays off our home in\nSeven years if we go the other route it pays off our home and three years is it worth four more years or whatever the number is you just run your numbers out I just made those up okay but in other words ... delayed the mortgage\nBeing paid off if you go the more expensive school route in order to get that world view\nWhich is fine and um now I I Will tell you having educated a paid for the education for three kids that are now adults\nAnd having participated in this discussion a multitude of times with friends that are Christians and and we are obviously to um [noise] that you need to be very careful if you're going to invest in a a a a private Christian school that they are actually\nImplementing that belief system\nThere are some that have a Christian heritage that are no more matching with my value system to fly to the moon\n[laughter] they just ... they once had something that was Christian and on and sometimes they are still holding themselves out as Christian school\n[laughter] they just ... they once had something that was Christian and and sometimes they are still holding themselves out as Christian schools but the values that they're tenured professors are bringing into the classroom at nothing to do with the values of miles hold\nAnd so if I'm going to do that I might if I won't be on the enemy territory I might as well know that I'm On enemy territory instead of a wolf in sheep's clothing kind of thing so if you're going to invest make sure you're getting what you're\nAttempting to get here I'm not saying that can't be done it can be done there are great Christian schools that do a great job of a quality education with\nThe quality of value system but you just gotta make sure you can't just assume because such and such was a Baptist school or such and such with Presbyterian but that might have been many years ago and there and you know they've got that in their heritage but there are no more than fly to the moon anymore um and so\nYou know that then you've just paid for an expensive school\nWith a questionable quality you know so they're not the second part of the equation as this and this is not the challenge you it's just a kid help you with your critical thinking and you decide which one you want to do in the process my three kids and sharing and I all went to University of Tennessee a public state school\nWhich there is some bizarre stupid but stuff that happens on that campus\n[laughter] okay I mean crazy and some of those professors are proof tenure should not be there you know I mean there is some nut burgers running around over there at my university campus okay and I love University of Tennessee but there's some stuff happening over there that just make your hair color or you know so my kids went there though\nBut here's the thing we figured out that our kids spiritual walk was not based on what happened at school it was based on what happened at home\nOkay and so our kids plugged into young life while they were in a public university setting and they already had their values and backbone and apologetic established\nBecause of how they were raised inside the remedy house so they were equipped to go into that environment and not quote unquote lose their salvation in the process now I'm not saying no Ramsey kid ever did anything stupid I can promise you rent a kid's\nRamsey are pretty much known for having done some stupid at one time [laughter] but but uh but but you know I you know you can do that in a Christian school too you know that right mhm right
