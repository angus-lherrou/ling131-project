D.\nAnd they have a pin like a PIN pat huh where you don't sign with think he signed with your fingertips but yeah God Knows what that looks right so I think the signature capture and verification process should be improved but aside from that I think vote by mail is is great\nOkay so you're not concerned about fraud regarding voter mail\n[noise] I've heard from some people not so much fraud but ballots out there that that probably shouldn't be I I've got I mean by that and what you mean well I'll tell you I've gotten\nA number of contacts to my website of people who received ballots for people who are deceased okay people who have moved so voter rolls that are not accurate yes exactly ... so to me that's it's an opportunity for fraud because somebody can\nFill out the ballot signed it with a somewhat illegible signature and turn it in but to me the main concern is that the voter rolls are not accurate and that needs to be improved\nBecause when it comes to to to voter fraud I mean we haven't had many he says in Arizona even if\nSomebody has voted on behalf of somebody who has passed away or somebody who has moved I mean here in our state we we investigate those and I think that they thirty had been turned into the attorney general's office twenty went for convictions sell well I think getting voter rolls up to date very very important\nBut our border south you know south of the state or our southern border\nAnd what has been going on down there and we have news that that the Pentagon is just signed off on some fifty two hundred number military personnel going down along the border I'd like to get your thoughts on that what do you think needs to be done along our southern border with immigration being such an important issue to the people here in Arizona\nIt is an important issue and one thing that I didn't realize until Iran and I spent a lot of time in a rural communities\nIs that it's not just immigration but it's drugs we have a very significant drug problem in our rural communities and it is directly affected by what's coming over the border it's not just people it's drugs and they're\nThe rural communities are struggling with this so border security is its people but it's also\nA opiate drugs yeah yeah\nYou know it's a very difficult problem I think it's unfortunate that the federal level in Congress a and with the administration they don't seem to have been able to come to a conclusion about it and it's become a political football\nFor the first thing you have to recognize as you have a problem and then you're\nA political football\nFor the first thing you have to recognize as you have a problem and then you have to find a solution do I think that people should just willy nilly\nCome across our border illegally no and you know the interesting thing is when you think about it if you fly into JFK and you're here illegally you cannot enter\nThe government's really turn you around put you on a flight wherever you can\nCry but if you walk across the border into someone's ranch a and your apprehended you're not sent back mhm so it's it's a real problem and it's certainly a problem for us that we have a lot of people coming in and the threat of a lot more if it needs to be handled it needs to stop\nA yeah I think immigration is a huge issue in in the state of Arizona and it was one that President Trump touched upon when he made his visit to may ... what was that two weeks ago my goodness\nIt already two weeks ago now I might have been might have even been long at all that well but I Want to get\nYour thoughts are where we are talking again to see again or he is the Republican candidate running for secretary of state here in Arizona\nThat rally there were several news reports of you kind of rolling up the crowd and getting them to chat fake news fake news fake news um did you do if so why and what do you think that that benefits\nWell it wasn't I I didn't try to get them a to say that they on their own recognize that the new ... I thought well I Am to know but I did make the point\nThat I felt the administration had made progress in many areas and that was not well covered that the news has been largely negative about the administration they think objectively that's the case\nSo when I made that point the crowd a chose to respond that way which was fine\nI think any of the rhetoric is is is leading to some of the division is the is the rhetoric of problem today I mean we're we're we're dealing with a few rules in Pittsburgh we had a male bomber or sending you know stuff through the mail is rhetoric it all responsible for\nAny of them you know responsible is one thing I I Do think the rhetoric on both sides is pretty heated and not always constructive\nPersonally I don't go that way if I have differences with someone I I don't try to shut them down I Try to understand their point of view and if I disagree persuade them to mine\nUh so that's that's my approach\nYou're we appreciate your time today thank you that I'm music ones we know we're we're we're out [laughter]\nSeems gainer Republican candidate for secretary of state with us in Studio thank you for your incite thank you for your answer three previous ... so ... are you go as you're filling out your mouth again I'm just remind you if you have one of those Maryland belt has to be in the middle of mom\nGot mine right here because I Want to get into that you're going to go up and vote that's next Tuesday\nOkay let's keep are are they are dates straight [noise]\nWe are looking for and trying to get details on it there are funerals just now starting in Pittsburgh for victims of the synagogue massacre Trump is on his way to fix for\nWho's going to meet him what's he going to do all these are that's coming up next on Arizona's Newsday [noise]\nArizona voters election day twenty Arizona's Senate candidates are campaigning hard as this race is still too close to call your ... by Arizona's morning news this morning Democrats or\nFor joining together because they're ready for United States\nAre safe and\nJamie welcome to make Sally Jewell tomorrow morning at seven forty KBA or not we rely on McCain PA our news\nAnd like he was here to tell you about my friends at Larry age Miller Hyundai Peoria we're talking about a community dealership here this is not some faceless corporation but a a dealership that get us back to their community as part of a community and it's the dealership that\nIs most others that you've been to before in fact their sales staff there not commission which means if you spend five rather spend fifty grand they make the same they're focused on you\nKnow their own commission and when I talk about being a part of the community well you know what tonight you can head on out to Larry age Miller Hyundai Peoria and they're going to have one of those like trunk or treats yes we're talking candy costume games\nHalloween decorated vehicles on display come dressed up it's going to be a scary good timing kicked off at five o'clock tonight runs until seven at Larry H Miller Hyundai Peoria and when you're on the line there you're going to see a ton I mean a ton a sad if a SUV if they've got some sixty five of these babies in stock\nTons of technology starting at twenty five grand 'cause I'm all for value when it comes\nEither of these babies in stock tons of technology starting at twenty five grand 'cause I'm all for value when it comes to your money all taking place right now at Larry each Miller Hyundai Peoria also on line Larry Miller Hyundai dot com\nNeed help managing your current employer sponsored retirement plans and towards financial can help with your current four one K. for three before fifty seven or for one am potentially add more to your return some industries where they can assess their medical airlines public services utility companies depend contractors in state\nContacts and twist financial worries hero for seven seven six three three eight for free consultation were easier for seven seven three three eight\nSecure even by the resources towards ... and I think we're dealing with your ex Dave Ramsey here\nFor years I've been telling everybody that window world is simply the best for lash apparently others I think so too JD power recently ranked window world highest in customer satisfaction with windows and patio door retailers\nWhich means absolutely no other replacement window company in the valley can offer you a better window or patio door at a lower price like six large premium quality solar zone shun field vinyl sliding windows\nPlus a full size sliding patio door installed tax included for only four thousand six hundred and fifty dollars and local owners Jim and Tony Ballard provide a lifetime warranty on every window including last breakage\nNo gimmicks no hassles call for details were scheduled a window world Phoenix dot com\nWindow world simply the best for less for J.

afford the heroin fourth hand think race in any number ... I get a lot\nOf calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care if they're reading you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts set and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally in forever is with time share exit team\nUm and those are you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a macabre is opening up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing us through what was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and or just getting to the part where we're ah we're working on whales and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our will together good and through that conversation we uh you\nKnow I'm a we've been discussing the actual needs trust or world I'd have to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your animal ...\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special condition who special rules because of course\nAh you know his his features are boring it's far too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as far as I'm getting into it and we haven't found anything quite yet but it would come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the trustee and I believe we go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to her death okay so that\nIt it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed except upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want out he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care for this child that\nFlew out of those assets now that the when the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing in the primary beneficiaries your wife\nOkay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is some portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life not\nJust through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds\nOkay your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that the dream the dream that's no yeah we're kicking them out so they're going\nThat's the legacy baby [laughter] but it's out of that then then what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example\nThe legacy by [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the rest of it would go to your ... more traditional airs directly\nOr but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child ... special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's eighty thousand dollars a year it'll produce that will take care of him and may be one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy them you know\nWould you would you go ahead like we're doing right now would you formula trust of the legal entity known now and we've been unfunded or would not let it would have put make a clause in in the well why not why would I Would\nMake it a clause in the will to be formed upon both of your deaths okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing\nYou don't need to ... that all the time you don't need to go to all the legal expense to form the trust so let me give you another example okay ... as a as a special conditional version of just taking care of minor children ride\nCooked and the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own show my need for a trust to cover my minor children in\nA in a live in both of our\nBest expires\nAt I formed a trust fund my minor children at that time that the need for that expired\nI Would have done it for nothing in this case was not going to be from now you're going to need a trust\nThe death and the ...\nThat's what I Would do whatever you want that's that's how we view\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve\nTheir families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans to make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to
