hasn't always kind of been there what makes what we're going through right now in a different\nWe are a we have a couple of things at play right now that are taking a bad situation and making it worse there has been over the last couple of months according to the border patrol an influx of people at the board\nYou know if you're looking at a numbers year over year the latest month for which we have numbers is is our guest and I'm from August of two thousand Seventeen to August of this year they signed an increase three times\nOver a year or so and the types of people were seeing at the border are families many with children who are presenting themselves\nTo border officials and requesting some form of amnesty\nAsylum asylum ... so they're coming from Central America mostly Guatemala yeah you have um I'll Salvador and others are the ones that we having here in Arizona that are that are being dropped off we'll get to that in the second or from\nGuatemala and that's also different so not only is it an increased threefold hero here not only is at families that at all are single\nYoung men coming to work construction\nBut those single young men you know looking to to do construction Bruce ... they don't normally present themselves to the board of knowing they try to avoid detection so an illegal immigrant somebody crosses the border illegally is different than an asylum seeker asylum seekers somebody who\nFeels as though their life is in jeopardy if they were to stay in their country yeah and since they're coming from Central America and not Mexico as has been the case of the norm in Mexico you know what you do yeah I Know you turn around and go right back over the border and you can you can it's difficult to make a credible asylum claim coming from it\nBut you come from Guatemala or you can't just\nTurn around and send them back to Mexico and the other country of origin\nDoesn't work like that and then we're going to add in um a court case this is the the forests case right known as the floor settlement\nAnd what this does is it limits the amount of time folks seeking asylum can be held in detention\nThan the date it's twenty days is the amount of time that children can be detained by ice\nAnd what we're finding out is that ice in that twenty day period cannot\nUse the term process the way they have ah been any they they can't keep up with the flow and so think of a\nA timer a buzzer going off at twenty days and ice by law is required to release these people into the United states so I used to\nTake a look and review each immigrants travel plans right who are you going to go stay with where are you going to be that ankle monitors they have to show up to a hearing and so there's a process that's supposed to pose like fair but\nWhat we're finding from ice right now is if they were to do that for every single person that's crossing the border right now and seeking asylum goes\nAll times and people just becoming numb to it and what it is a tent out of here like like what is\nI I'm sure this is deadly devastating it just seems like the next one third grade teacher teaching consent is a two young ... show right we'll talk about it
