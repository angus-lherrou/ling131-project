[noise]\n[noise] okay I I I've yet to understand and looking at all this I don't think it's this specific test those like your one twentieth or one one hundredth or one half or whatnot but her DNA test a came back\nBut there is quote strong evidence is was from the DNA doctor so she didn't do twenty three me she didn't just send this the way in the mail she right when actual DNA Dr\nUm and the analysis shows that she has Native American ancestry now it is not doesn't appear to be recent uh ancestry but that she has some Native American in her ... her background\nSo this analysis places her Native American ancestor between six and ten generation that go with the report as to\nAnd what the report estimating eight generation so she comes out and says during her life that she has Native American ancestry okay apparently that is true that's true okay Trump before this was done came out and said you're a liar I don't believe you don't if\nYou buy a guy that didn't believe that uh uh the president was born in the ... remember that consistent with this conspiracy\nAnd they bring their own beliefs biases preconceived notions yup\nAnd so there's arguments at Arizona is also arbitrary and its selection of who received the death penalty or or which prosecutors go after the death penalty or not so this is the argument that isn't all state Senate finally one in Washington\nAnd I don't think that that argument will win anytime soon here in Arizona because it's been filed very recently in fact and it hasn't won here\nBut I think we will see other reasons why the death penalty will go away here in Arizona\nI'm how close were you and you understand the legal system better than I Do Monica so you have I Want to see this eleven states over the last decade or so that have struck down the death penalty and these are states with habits and their court system there Supreme courts have said no\nDoes this eventually get to the U.S Supreme Court and how does it get to the Supreme Court\nYes so you need that perfect case that will go out to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court has in the past put a moratorium on the death penalty\nI Believe it was back in the seventies the Supreme Court came out and said no state can execute anybody until you figure out how to do it fairly and justly okay and so when the states were able to show the Supreme Court or the federal government that it was able to do that then the moratorium went away and they were allowed to execute people again now statistics\nDo sick and and the numbers are the numbers\nThat we as a country not just ... we execute minorities at a higher rate even in a higher rate of committing crimes\nWe execute men at a higher rate poor and poor people at a higher rate disproportionate so if you are a rich female\nAnd white you got very little chance of received ... almost regardless of whatever crime he committed ... absolutely and if you're poor or a male and black well guess what you have a disproportionate\nA chance of receiving the death penalty and that's what ... states were arguing or at least for the arguments are they're strict records have been\nBut that is not an equal application of the law and Arctic they've done it a little argument they\nDo they have a good argument here in Arizona we have a hundred and sixteen inmates that are on death row right now a hundred and six hundred and sixty three of those are women a hundred and Thirteen or ... not\nRight off the bat you look at that and say you is that ... is that an accurate representation of people that have committed violent crimes people that have committed murder I can tell you when it is yeah but it can give women have we hesitate to give women but took them\nA great but it's not too far off because women there's not a high rate of women who committed\nBy fifty alright arguing the right one hundred and Thirteen to three and it ain't got either of the hundred and\nThird well of the hundred and sixteen sixty three are are identified as white Eighteen black\nUm twenty something Hispanic so you can see that there are more white people on death row here in Arizona but there is more white people that are exactly so I think in the future we will see the death penalty go way here in Arizona but it'll be more because of the impractical ability\nThan cost then yes the cost and how practical it is then the arbitrariness\nAlso vitamins and quickly running out of time is a harder and harder to get for the lethal injection drugs for drug companies\nSay we didn't make the drugs for you to kill

really want to finance this car over Fifteen Years\nYou know what I Want to do that so and it's a car I Can't afford I Can't afford to pay for it um if you didn't pay for it when you can't afford it so yeah I'm Sorry dude I notice a sweet car and I'm a car guy like nice cars but I'm\nToo many times are nice cars have us instead of us have them Shannon is with us in Atlanta Hi Shannon how are you\nHi hey what's up to be here to to have you know\nI I'm I I'm I'm trying to figure out what to do my an apprenticeship position that's paid but it's only about thirty grand a year\nWe expect that and about a year he would be making pretty good money around a hundred grand shall we say\nHe is it's kind of an architectural fails to this [noise]\nUm and he's got a great opportunity and we definitely agree like I said that we should do so well Lebanon parents' basement yeah because he couldn't live on that um what we have for that and [noise]\nBut what I'm thinking and feeling as a um he's doing that and it's like he's he's logged anything forty hours a week [laughter] but meanwhile like we're just barely getting by ... and living in the parents' basement said break\nDeal and I've been working part time I got a baby but I've been doing some stuff to bring in some kind of how old are you really how she's eight months old\nHow old are you too oh thirty four and thirty six okay All right\nAnd he took the show we did this apprentice jobs how long ago\nIt's been about six months\nAnd there's written promises that at the completion of The Apprentice apprenticeship that he will have access to this kind of income\nYou know there are no promises I never heard\nOf an architectural sales apprenticeship so I'm just is new to me I'm trying to understand\nWhy he would do this you know it's not um it's not a norm like a a very common thing and that's all right he's got it set in the door and a good this year and um that advocate at a lot of people don't get 'em\nAnd we noted on our own you know like we were totally believe in that this will happen it's just I don't know if you're in the meantime it's like okay we're\nOnly working forty hours in the meantime and needs to be working on the job\nCreate [noise]\nYup got bills to pay you can't pay and his wife who's got a baby at home is calling me it's a pretty simple equation and he's more money so how far ... what what is

make a dent in our debt I ... you know we're not we're just barely paying\nAre trying to calm I'm trying to get you where you could mathematically pay the bills mathematically does a thousand dollars a month extra do it\nNow okay what is it like living us out\nNo I'm not trying to move you out your own an apprenticeship agreed to live in her basement and now you're having to put up with her\n[laughter] goes with the territory is what you signed up for it you know you can't afford to move out while he's on the apprenticeship\nGreat that you're stuck there you're stuck there for six more months or ... as a six more months left in this thing\n[noise] um [noise]\nLike I said we don't really know exactly I Would I Would guess\nGreat I Would I guess about a year okay I Want to know exactly [noise] ... friday by friday\nI Want to know what the guidelines are official partnership one of the ends of my income goes up shark and move out of your mother's basement\nThis ... this I Hope they keep their word I think they're going to keep their word but I'm not even sure what word they gave me it doesn't work for me I think you guys need a nail this deal down so you know what you signed up for and you know what you signed up for so you can see alive and the tunnel and you can put a chart on the wall when you get to move out of his mother's basement\nAnd um and then he needs to work and extra job to get the bills paid and I'm going to guess and say you have a big honking car payment and he'd sell the car or just a gash but it's a fairly educated guess so I Would add that to
