I don't know the other one\nYeah cynical tall as they come up with fake names because it can't be name anything else has ever used and it's supposed to do something about what the drug does for you so they just sit around and some I I feel horrible for the people in these boardroom stuff to come up with the ...\nBut we're knowing the price\nOf the drug being advertised because getting their advertising it for you to go into your doctor I Want you to prescribe me ... will knowing the price change people's minds\nYou know that's a really good question I I think that people perhaps with really good insurance plans it I don't think I Will matter one way or another because they'll think that their insurance will cover it\nFor what what do I care if my doctor who is the same I pretty much the drug called that's right and now those as long as it doesn't lead to stomach pain\nSwollen ankles and death with Syria orange skin and potentially ... orange I rarely those people that don't have insurance I\nI think this will matter to them but then again it's a sliding scale as to what these drugs cost so I don't know how they're going to pin it down now well you'll be seeing it suits\nDrug makers ads must disclose the place [noise]\nWithout making more competitive will they be embarrassed to say five thousand dollars a month I Hope so I Hope so yeah we'll find out I'm I'm interested to find out what I ...

the hash tag me too movement but it was just about a year ago the actress ...\nMilan oh I'm treated to her large group of followers and really is it fair with the kind of kicked it off made it more more common\nAnd what she did is um she treated a request to her followers quote if you've been sexually harassed or assaulted\nRight me too is a reply to this tweet that was a year ago\nA lot of people responded hash tag ... me too so that's where it came from him you will and it seems that even the response surprised her right\nYeah ... said that she had done this basically to just get some support and she was very surprised so here she is\nPhilosophy was if I could put it out there and people didn't have to tell their stories are known their predators but just in solidarity\nSo we can get a real good glimpse of the number but I I never expected obviously by the time I woke up seven hours later that fifty three thousand people would have required\nYeah uh and obviously you look a year later from now and it has grown has become something much bigger than just that tweet me too um\nBut we are with what is fundamentally changed\nWell even though a lesson mulatto is the one that put out that tweet a year ago this really started people credit Toronto Burke for starting this whole me too movement in fact she was named as\nTime person of the year for two thousand Seventeen when they had several people several women on the cover up to movement she was one of them on there and I think where we are now\nIs it is so\nIt is so known it is so common we are in the year or the era of me to right now so everybody is aware of what it is where before at people weren't talking about it so I think we're talking about it now\nTalking about it so much that it's been weaponized and what they mean by that if people are using the me too movement as a weapon\nInstead of just using it as awareness and and that's where the bad part can\nCome and give it to you know you obviously come from a a legal background and I I think I don't know we'll have that discussion right now you know the idea of innocent until proven guilty allegations are not convictions\nObey yes they are with me too they are\nBut but as as an attorney that most of the strike you as a little bit okay listen I can be supportive of me too\nA group of me too but your hash tag or your accusation is not a conviction we have a process that we go through to determine guilt or innocence I Would make the argument\nThat if you're accused of someone of murdering somebody or they're not a murderer until you can prove it in court\nRight right right they typically can't be punished until early ... you know but that's not the way me to operate in is that a good thing\nThe inside of a book you take out a

so we haven't gotten our first one we just moved um so the house payment will be around sixteen hundred a month\nOkay you're right at a fourth ... right and you have no other that except the student loans\nCorrect okay and so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think you know I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income okay you got a lot of student loans for two teachers\nWhere do we do where did you get your degrees\nOr so she has her masters I got my bachelor's see we we both work in a new northern Arizona university\nWow

that way you can see that tree fall over from your shopping\nIf you just chop a tree and it never falls over it's no fun you know so you need to be you need to feel that reward of that little one going away when that little one goes away then you can attack the next one down but you got a five year plan unless you had some income to this uh and it's going to be a tough five years really hard\nAnd so I'm probably picking up some tutoring some coaching some something things that teachers do on the side or to earn extra money you probably make another twenty grand tutoring in\nTurn your five year plan into a two and a half year plan\nAnd uh that would be preferable a but\nYou're going to pay a price uh eat one way or another it's going to the price you're going to phase is going to take you a long time to get out of debt and that's one price and that's a real painful price or you're going to get really intense focused and give up your life\nFor a short period of time to get rid of the ... a lot faster and you know two two and a half years you can do that but you guys are gonna be working twenty four seven to do that with the numbers are given me and you can do it though I see teachers do it all the time bill is with us in Nashville Hi Bill how are you\nA day hey thank you I'm Kate we got an upside down car um we owe Thirteen thousand dollars on a car it's a book values seven thousand but unfortunately we've got a seven thousand dollar maintenance bill a silly thing we'd we'd have to pay to get it up a even being worth seven thousand\nWhich is asking what the heck makes sense to do with this car\nThat doesn't make sense um what what kind of seven thousand dollar car has a seven thousand dollar maintenance bill\nIt's a two thousand and five BMW six forty five\nAnd what's wrong with it for God's sakes\nIt's got an engine he'll problem that cost about seven or advocate fix\nOkay what if it's worth seven thousand dollars and it takes seven thousand dollars to fix it that means it's not worth anything that's right there's got to be an alternative way to get this thing fixed are you dealing with the dealer\nOr no dealing with a mechanic to specialize in the ... yeah\nAnd that's a that's a ridiculous you can't spend seven thousand I mean you're better off to just turn into a truck driver I Would think the caller Iran I think the car would probably bring a couple of grand even with the shape it's in but you owe Thirteen on it so basically you're a Thirteen thousand on her credit card debt is what you're half that's right that's attached to a car so what's your household income\nOr almost a hundred\nOkay yeah I'm just country like Thirteen thousand dollar a credit card debt I guess the car sits in the driveway I'm ... ... other transportation um who do you owe them money to\nUm to the car I guess cars USA so it's our bank about veteran\nOkay we'll go out to the usa might actually work with you and let you sign an an secured note for the balance of what it doesn't bring\nAt least that way you can get the tags and the insurance and stuff off of you and you know ... for a couple of grand salvage and then you've got loving thousand dollars you just got an an secured note because you bought a home you bought a piece of garbage apparently oh my gosh I'm so sorry I'm Sorry I ... I hate\nThat that you're saying exactly what my wife has come on\nSorry [laughter] you already knew [laughter]\n[laughter] oh and I'm being usually beamer seven six series are pretty good cars I'm really shocked I Can't find something to do to get that thing patched together cheaper than that\nI'm going to go back on your mechanic and or um maybe get a second opinion from another independent\nBeamer a mechanic\nOr and or pushback on this guy and go listen there's no possible way we're spending seven ground on car there's a book by yourself and grant\nSo you got any other ideas man [laughter] as you're getting this job [laughter] see if he's got something else we can do I don't know I mean the fuel systems are finicky I Know that I've had a couple of them\nAnd generally they're great cars I'm I'm a beamer fan ritual wants them to vote was used on the other day it's really a nice car\nBut um yeah uh now I\nI'm just going to I'm a pushback get a second opinion pushback on this guy I work with us today and then so you make a hundred grand I got eleven thousand dollar or the worst case like I live in thousand dollar\nA credit card debt here I just got to pay off how fast can I pay it off and you don't get the title back and then sell it for salvage if if us I won't work with you and do it on an secured loan basis transfer that negative equity and went on secured loan but\nI'm hopeful you could figure out what to put a couple of grand in it and then if it's worth a couple of grand salvage it's been two more on this like having four in it and it would sell for seven then if you can figure that out that would be a lot better use of\nThe situation but\nNo way you spent seven thousand dollars on a car or seven thousand dollars a myth that doesn't the map the
