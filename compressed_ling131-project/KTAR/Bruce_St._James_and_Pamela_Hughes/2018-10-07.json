and are popular media and of course that is the U.S Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh this past week\nIt's always interesting to see how foreign media covered this story and they certainly did all around the globe and we'll bring you some of that on the program it is election day in Brazil where the Donald Trump of Brazil is expected to win this important round it's not quite winner take all today could but most likely will\nNot we will have reaction about what is happening in the south America's largest economy in one of the world's most influential nations it again is there another move for anti establishment Donald Trump style of politics and why does it seem to be gaining in momentum when\nWhen you look at the establishment they are telling you there's nothing to worry about in the exact opposite is happening that is also coming up on today's program very quietly and hugely under reported also in the United states the United states government is announcing a second summit between the kid dictator in North Korea and Donald Trump\nHas been sets my palm pay it was just back from meeting with the kid dictator in North Korea we'll have details of that also\nAnd has

that uh you know immigration I've never been a favorite of the United states so they don't even touch subject but that's the reality you know you improve working conditions in may go less people will be tempted uh or feel tempted to go to the United states\nNow as you know and we've talked about this should stitches Trump was on the campaign trail he is still publicly saying I'm going to build a wall there's this new NAFTA deal impact the demand or the requirement for Trump to build a wall\n[noise] well no I mean that Trump says that she was talking about war you into negotiations but nothing came out of it may cause still firmly in saying we don't pay for any wall\nAnd supposedly Donald Trump it's uh it's about to make a major announcement on the wall during the month of October but nobody has\nSaid any particular date what are you uh what what is the focus on what kind of announcement have you heard these going to make that nobody knows that judge that he's going to make a big announcement about it will\nShow where the different government that generationally different government led by Lopez Obrador how will uh how old she adopted this leads say oh I'm happy to take it even though I did negotiate ... or is she going to resist\nThe he had he had his negotiators in place you know as as a president elect has a right to participate in the negotiations so he set delegation participate it I think the labor\nWaveform is part of what he pushed for and he got it that side as you say a campaign promise\nWatch or hay and Mexico to get us started on this edition of voice to America a view from Mexico about Trump's new NAFTA deal also Mexico's Newt after you also Canada's new NAFTA deal uh coming up at about ten minutes we'd go up to Canada\nAnd we will hear a Canadian perspective on how they are being sold again everything's e version of the truth or we will find out the hard way it's always a way it is because everybody below president of the United states is lower on the food chain so the information is coming from the people at the very top\nAnd we'll figure it out eventually but we're going to continue to work to find out how the different things are being sold interesting what Jorge said about the possibility of Trump will make what he considers to be another major announcement on the wall coming up very soon and we know that our mid term elections are now just a few weeks away also and that is another big campaign promise that a lot of folks that support Trump\nOr looking at the two\nAre still to come also boy we will take a look

the global talk show now back to ...\nActually to Jorge and Mexico to get started on this edition of voice of America or minutes away from Canada and we'll get another perspective for North the border on the new NAFTA deal what it\nMay mean for you and then it is\nCourse this just stay warm up for Trump's biggest trade war that's going on and that is a with China related all of that of course is is the north Korea nuclear deal and uh [noise]\nChina is the key player there the trade wars are ... are integral and completely entwined with the north Korea deal that should be obvious to everybody and both sides are using it as a ... tried to use it as leverage or secretary of state Mike Pompeo I just went and had another meeting and apparently a sat down at the formal meetings and then also had a lunch\nDid some of the press citizen public photos in in some some talk\nWith the kid dictator in North Korea and what they are announcing it again versions of the truth this is what we get who knows what happened in that meeting but one thing that they both sides are announcing is that there's going to be a summit part to as soon as possible between the kid dictator and Trump\nAnd so that continues to show at least some momentum the big question that everybody's watching is is is this North Korea playing their old game which is you know sure you know we'll play nice for a little while extract some small concessions by some time and then we'll flip and then you will will will go back to just building our nuclear weapons\nOr keep in mind to the entire world is going to be watching these midterm elections coming up and seeing what happens with our Congress if it's reshaped what kind of jam will that be a for Donald\nTrump's a agenda of what you're getting ... you look at Brett Kavanaugh just this past week you look at the NAFTA deal just this past week it is remarkable that he is able to fulfill are so many of his campaign promises\nA in why it is remarkable is also a testimony to how little actually gets done or the intention on the campaign trail to establishment politicians to say what they want on the on the campaign ... fully well knowing that they're never going to even attempt to follow through with us they just you know they extract that pander to\nThe minute the second the moments to just grab whatever votes they can and they have no intention whatsoever to fulfilling it\nWhat is different is is that Trump's if things go I'm going to tear up NAFTA I'm going to do another deal apparently he has done\nThat yeah and he says I'm going to get to your conservative judges in there and apparently he's doing that he says he's going to get a wall\nAnd we'll say we says Mexico is going to pay for it you know I doubt it but you know he says if this is what he's going to do but\nHe is a he is working in in some cases succeeding in what what he campaigned with and that is hugely remarkable simply because our politicians will be become accustomed to as what they see on the campaign trail [noise]\nIt's just folly it's just talk and uh you know the idea of actually following through with anything just it's not even we've come to know we've come to expect none of it and they know fully well that it's just a you know it's like a game of mental masturbation that's all they're doing they're just sitting there spinning in circles blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and suddenly\nThat has changed whether it's would you think is good or bad will see and that's the question what's going on with North Korea also is it a gay mostly for China is it the game to actually denuclearize North Korea is North Korea happy again just to play low level play low level extract small concessions\nAnd then wait for Trump either to be voted out in a couple of years or six years or the terms of jam up and they'll just play the long game\nWhen we come back we go up to Canada we find out what the Canadian stick to Justin Trudeau get bullied by Donald Trump through the dairy farmers actually a concede a wire the steel tariffs still in place the candidate says this humiliating\nVoice to America where the world comes to talk [noise]\nI'm here with herb works with my trainer Carl Schnell the longevity personal training herb I understand you have quite the story\nI've always been an active person including swimming four to five days a week a few years ago I began to experience shoulder pain to the point that I couldn't swim without any pain at all\nAfter one failed shoulder surgery I went back for a second one and even then and after seeing a physical therapist my shoulder just wasn't the same and I still couldn't get back in the pool without pain\nYeah you're at the bottom of the food chain and you try you cry or you you know you you make it you you try to jak you become a teenager you know you get rebellious\nYeah it's a lot of pushback it's very difficult nothing has changed and that's what we'll do our change is hard to the top of the hour with a more of that let's go to Darren now who lives in Alberta, Canada\nHe's contributed this program before he has an entrepreneur and on several businesses are chatted with him from his home right for the program about Donald Trump's and Canada's andme Mexico's new NAFTA deal and asked him what the reaction was in Canada most Canadians\nThat I Know of you know they really don't think there was that much of a change um you know to see that much different than after I get those concessions we gave but I think a lot of people with some sort of Trump's rhetoric lot we're worried it could be a lot worse and it turned out to be really not that bad compared to what we already have in place\nAre you surprised that Canada was willing to sign up the way that it did after being after Mexico move first with with Trump and then they basically came back to Canada and said we've got no time left you got to get on board really quickly or not are you surprised that went along with that or was that in the plan all along\nWhile I'm getting if you look at these statistics Canada realizing that states but so much was trait I forget Seventy percent of our trade ethnic or something like that is what the US so you know you guys aren't playing part in our economy so in some ways you know you have a gun jihad to some degree and a lot of girls\nNot much surprise that we signed by the deadline on the other hand there was also some some you know posturing back and forth but your Congress I think that's the correct term was as to vote on it and they wouldn't vote on it without Canada but more and I think more people thought that for sure we'd better get this deal done because you know Trump said here's a deadline and Mexico signed him\nBecause he doesn't have such a huge trading partner I Would think that was a huge impact on the line there signs up for their life\nSo the dairy industry in Canada that's been a big public issue that at least in the all the ... keep talking about\nAnd it looks like there was some movement here in the United states dairy farmers are being told that it's a better deal for them that they're going to have more access to the Canadian market and that there's been some some movement there do you see it that way or Canadian dairy farmers saying that that it's gonna be a little tougher for them\n[noise] well I think of all the issues that was probably the one that got the most pressing candidate because one political party wants to get well one of the leaders of political party to watch um wants to get rid of the the dairy protectionism and Canada and the and the consumer ... allow it to continue happening to their prices are so much higher than if you're traveling by\nYour milk and eggs and and and butter somewhere else so that one part of the most press and of course the dairy farmers are saying well the sky is falling everything's terrible but when you look at the stats it barely changed at all\nSo that was the one in your samples was on the bandwagon the Mossad Nicholas suggesting that we had to allow the Americans had more access there as it turns out in the fine print it was really very little change on well there's a little teeny bit to say that we change it but\nThat was the biggest wanting that are that people are so upset that we have to keep paying that much money as they do for for Gary\nTrump's a steel tariffs and aluminum tariffs he says they're going to stay in place for now I Know Canada publicly his continued to say that this is like an insult to you've got these close allies you mentioned huge trade partners of uh in the defense partners for so many generations\nAnd they're ... they still say that this is particularly ah insulting\nThe Trump would keep the steel tariffs in place why is that political rhetoric or the steel terrorists\nAre are are they are they excessive to the Canadian business\n[noise] well I think the biggest thing to look at it from a ... perspective all started with tariffs I think that the premise on why they're implemented them if they were you know national interests and documented exact\nNational someone you probably know national security is if it's a security threat\nRight so you know every note that says let's be honest with the joke can they encountered on a national security threat to the United states and will always been there for you know really for each other and when it comes to defense matters throat last hundred years or so\nSo again you know once the deal was signed that was kind of like washed under the rug or from the rocket ... you know has really been brought up\nThere is some unhappiness because you know it's a big amount of money to get the care but again once for not to be able to find like on basically just thought that they did the best thing in the world than it signed in there and you can find a candidate for the next you know Twenty years herself so\nThat really even come up too much in the discussion but I've had with people or even the press much Justin\nPress much Justin Trudeau how is how is he how does he come out of this\nI think somewhere in between you know every not every but I think something like a year ago when he was elected two years ago seven to ten provincial governments were liberal leaning and now it's only a couple left\nSo he's got a lot of internal problems at home with you on the tide seems ... little bit more towards the rights compared to the left um you know again a lot of people like it or not they'll stuck up for Trudeau no matter what the deal with really scientifically either Trump negotiated\nA lot of people that were never going to forget some of the things that were saddened bullying tactics that Trump was good at doing\nSo I think he gets sort of a free coffee Canada more than anything lateral ... politically just because of you know people knew that Iraq against company here so unpredictable you know what the hell is going to say an extra do so that I think helped a lot in his arms of Trump's no negotiating style in public\nYou know that's kind of the big thing that everybody is discussing here which is could this this NAFTA deal\nBe a practice round for the bigger trade deal which would be the United states in China is that the take away after all this the Trump is is a bully and a and and uh an unfair in the way that he approaches a negotiations\nI think that was good the sentiment before it was fine but then once it was signed it starts locally details as well because it really didn't change a lot or is it like you know the most thing she didn't really come through on\nThat he you know kind of mentioned in public or lacrosse like coca theory again and again I don't remember the percentage but it it was barely changed also perch and after about but once they get on how you know get the\nThe biggest protection of the world like stereo this but at the end of the day the details say change much so um that's why again like he he was a boy and the crafts and you know he's on earth rocks all that stuff and that's why one of the world's total comes out on top as far as well\nShe signed a deal and he's dealing with Trump and you know something else you've been with China even in the new NAFTA um you know now we have to be very careful about trading partners because we can't do deals with China and that's actually been in the U.S quite a bit is how we're kind of you know ... second guessed by the Americans\nBecause we now have to get their approval ... deals with countries like China so that's actually got the press or more than anything since the\nLast time we talked with you you told us a little bit about one of the businesses that you have it was a coffee business and how just the last year the uncertainty in the negotiations going on with all three North American countries\nHad a impacted the way that that you chose to do business now that this deal looks to be just about done well are you continuing to to do a pivot in and change the way you're doing business with some of your business is\nWell I think I Am a little bit maybe I have an unfair advantage because I went to Mexico for a number of years are different businesses and now just maybe open my eyes a little more to say hey you don't want to look around down in Mexico I anyway so I'm not sure the average Canadian with\nYou that there has a business but because I travel throughout the world will open some interest maybe I'm just a little more prone to doing it but ever since they say it's definitely getting in more of an awareness to say you know like what you look out you know poke around more not necessarily good or bad of United States but just you know it's a big world and want to look around more\nAs

A. F.\nWe will hear from a venerable a popular journalist Ted Koppel yep this is\nThis kind of interesting now anybody under the age of thirty five\nYou know who Ted Koppel is yea for Nightline right yeah but that was I mean that's when I was a kid he was I mean yeah he hadn't been on when you were like two he was ... but this is still when a popular electronic media still had a semblance of credibility you know they still try to\nBe that or even try any more I mean as you said it's fun it's fun for entertainment purposes but I mean they\nYou know this is what ... that that was it um\nAnd so you do what you do know who he is well yeah yeah or if he's like eighty years old though he's been retired for a good ten or Fifteen Years\nOn his heyday was really the eighties and end of the night or two thousand he was the right way past is prime and you know ... Ron Burgundy it completely taken over electronic journalism and that's a good Twenty years ago it was already jumping to Charlotte so we'll hear from him today\nWe're also here a from a one of the favorites of the program not Philip Mudd but Don Lemon and this is interesting because you are\nThe shows the extent when we say we spare no expense we go to all links to a helping this type of Donald Trump Brett Kavanaugh of Brexit um and we said look this is our public service sector\nWhere we know we recognize we're doing it for ...\nRecognize doing it for the kids we recognize that literally not only half of the United states but half of the world\nIs a show trigger that cannot function any longer\nAnd then the other half is saying look we we know the change happens in life and when we got to figure out the best way to do it it's like anything else you know you get hired and fired from a job you're businesses go boom they go bust you get married you get divorced you you know a family members are healthier than they die I mean this is this is part of life\nAnd this piggy back from last week when we found out that there is actually an employee at CNN who's in charge of\nOf not swearing on their right making sure that people don't share on human resources director for on airs you deserve the standard and called journalistic standards and quality of CNN correct okay so this is from two thousand Fifteen oh go ahead and play it\nAll I Want to get this from media he says total\nBS excuse me I mean the total BS pardon me I did not mean that I can always says\nThat's from two thousand Fifteen now he says he says the word the U.S we we do we do the beeping program he apologized immediately apologized so what we've seen now is is that he loved to get will give them the benefit of the doubt back to you let it slip but then apologized and said that wasn't meant to come out this is not what we do on this program\nTo this you found just what five days ago in a six days ago six days ago same guy same channel same show three years later go ahead and played up\nThis went on after the show and people wanted to get up including us because we didn't want to listen that both that\nYeah and we picked it up and we did so that's the key point and we've been saying this forever to is there was a shift around two thousand Fifteen with Donald Trump started a campaign in Bay CNN still says their policy is no swearing on the air\nBut then that happened but we kept noticing and saying they keep telling us there's no swearing they don't support this family program gold standard journalism it specifically that word be asked we said you can just CBS we all know what it means there's absolutely no reason to say the whole world other than again to chase ratings to chase ratings you could leverage it into the\nUh for instance here over just the last two years this is all CNN program and go ahead\n[noise] he has spent his whole life but\nHe has succeeded by both thing he has gotten the presidency by both thing it's very hard to tell somebody at that point the boats and doesn't work\nThat I find that a lot of hunting I Am a proud ... colors and built this country a hundred and ten years ago they were called person's\nGeorge Tenet is a first generation Greek I guess he's a shower and we're learning the same lessons that we learned when we called the Chinese Man a guy when we called the man from Guatemala\nAnd we call a black man in\nOkay um\nAnd yet they say the standards are no shares are very high and here you go from two thousand Fifteen he was apologizing now there's no apology we did all the ... by the way that the point of this is we'd be put out because\nLike why can't like there's a thousand Fifteen lemon we say look we don't we this is these are our stance we choose not to do that on there but they now they're out there doing it in a while they're doing that they're saying we're not we're not doing it they're they're doing it and then telling you were not doing it\nRight filter saying thirty percent increase in ratings doesn't matter doesn't\nMatter bottles that he had done but it's this kind of stuff that's gotten in the ratings ... of course it so this is what I'm saying we don't lose that go out there right now and I'm over and look I'm open to the possibility that\nMaybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong maybe it really is something else but I've seen no evidence to indicate that I'm wrong but I'm open to it and if somebody wants to make a convincing argument please do\nWe keep finding this and saying it doesn't make you know if somebody says we don't swear and then they swear ... that's not convincing to me than\nIt you're right and wrong stealing your wallet how but I I've been to understanding\nOr something else but you've got to make a convincing argument is I I'm not one that just as they say there for I Believe it's like you say something you've got to give me some at some something to back

around the world\nTony from you know on voice to America\nAt all in a tune into the change is hard segment that will be archived you can re listeners share to if you wish so the company got a multiple global\nMedia spotlights more on our lead story which is the new NAFTA deal between Trump Canada and Mexico we've already given your reaction for some of our voices both north and south of the United states I was in our first hour will archive this program and you can go back and re listen or listen to it for the first time if you missed it\nUp and we'll have more on how Canadian media covered this story also there it is a first round a presidential elections in Brazil\nLargest economy largest nation in Latin America and it appears that the Trump of Latin America is poised to wind down there and do we will ask the obvious questions again and start looking at it if we're being told by the institutions that Trump\nIs bad ... is bad five star movement is bad Marine Le pen is bad you're builders is bad a but\nEither the their momentum continues to grow or they're outright\nWins what in the world is going on somebody can't be telling the truth\nAnd we'll continue to examine that on a global basis and find out of the Trump is truly uniquely American phenomenon which I have always argued that it isn't and if you listen to this program you know exactly why because we only talked to people outside of the United states and they said you guys it's not a phenomena as a matter of fact you're behind the curve\nIn places around the world what happened here in the United states with our last presidential election I've been going on a lot longer outside\nThe United states and they certainly saw it coming but we'll be talking about that a developing story that we will continue to follow for you to is is that a Saudi journalist and a former advisor ... are critical to the Saudi monarchy\nA has somehow disappeared in Turkey\nAnd he went into a constantly building the Saudi constantly building in Istanbul\nThis this is according to the Turkish government and somehow disappear [noise]\nNow the allegations are\nA range from he disappeared we don't know where he is too he was murdered inside the constantly but this is a public narrative that is being pushed from turkey all the way up to president urged them on there and of course the larger question is this is a version of the truth all of it as version of the truth\nBut what is behind all of this if the allegations are true those are bad enough but if it's coming from the highest levels of power from Saudi Arabia to turkey considering what we do know about those governments it is much bigger than just one man even if he was a journalist and critic of this\nWas a journalist and critic of the Saudi Government America where the world comes to talk [noise]\nToday I'm here with herb works with my trainer Karl ... longevity personal training herb I understand you have quite the story\nI've always been an active person including swimming four to five days a week a few years ago I began to experience shoulder pain to the point that I couldn't swim without any pain at all\nAfter one failed shoulder surgery I went back for a second one and even then and after seeing a physical therapist my shoulder just wasn't the same and I still couldn't get back in the pool without pain\nFor law enforcement I I don't think so I think it's probably its reputation and it's propaganda or a little bit more than ... authoritative and their actual action on the ground but nonetheless\nHe has his title is president of a Interpol which I'm finding out is more of a the ceremonial role than an actual you know I'm I'm I'm a tough this street leather shoe leather cop who's out there\nGetting the bad guys around the globe but he is also security official and he's not young he's in his mid sixties who has worked inside China and remain and maintains that I mean just stop and think about that for a second\nHow do you become president of Interpol while maintaining a high security position for the government of China I mean that's not a conflict of interest what is I mean this is this this is the point of institutions there's all kinds of conflicts of interest and why is it\nFollow the money don't don't follow social justice don't follow you know I Believe that maybe in their down low or in the middle but follow the money for us but nonetheless\nIt's interesting story is is like so many a prominent people recently in China or where Xi Jinping has basically consolidated his power over the last year or two and become emperor\nAnd a ... in in ... and again history tells us what happens with that\nUh he was in China flew into China from his home in France race where he lives were Interpol is is based\nAnd uh and then he disappeared and apparently he knew about it is suspected that something could happen and so he had his wife and kind of on the deal and saying you know if I don't show up or if I don't call or something like this I sensitive I might be in danger which begs the question why are you going back of your life is in danger\nWhat China is now confirmed is is that he is being detained still alive\nBeing detained nobody's heard from 'em but China at least admits that again there's some anti new anti corruption laws and he is\nBeing questioned uh in that we've seen actresses you know and in China that their their version of Hollywood starlet they have been detained they disappear for a while nobody hears from and then suddenly they reappear and make the public apology\nAnd say oh I did wrong and I'm paying this fighter I'm doing whatever and she she and paying his great he's he's like the kid dictator we're starting to see this\nAgain ah what just commonsense tell us when you consolidate power in a communist country or any country but in this case it historically communist country and then you see something where the very top consolidates even more power than what you've seen in recent decades\nOr you're going to you know expect these types of moves where they're going to start rounding up people and they're going to create new laws that nobody knows about people are going to be disappeared and then suddenly they come back and they're like oh I Love the dear leader version paying and I'm going to pay this fine and the\nThe bigger question is\nOne of the western institutions do because if you've got a guy who's part of an eastern institution a communist government and then he's also the head at least ceremony and the ... of ... a western institution based in France the democracy all of that\nMore pressure on institutions this is ...\nTo to me and nobody will say this nobody will see it this way is it is in another great wide open example of western institutions\nUnder attack under pressure and you know the strongman guys like ... the powerful vision paying emperor kid dictator\nNow under the Brazilian elections uh this is a country that\nHuge corruption problems which has nothing doesn't certainly make them exclusive to or any other country but nonetheless\nUh Brazil is a significant power not only in Latin America but around the globe economically also a and this is the guy that this band that we are going to hear this global media spotlight about both Inara was the candidate they call them the Trump of Latin America or the Trump of Brazil he was the guy that was out campaigning publicly and got stabbed in the stomach\nAnd has recovered uh let's see how this is being were covered this is from al Jazeera the CNN of the middle east again showing you\nHow a media here in the United states are very myopic if you've been following anything over the last three or four weeks it's it's Brett Kavanaugh all the time only time that's the only store they can cover we got nothing on NAFTA we can do this for you today we're trying to get ... you know this Interpol chief Brazil\nInterpol chief Brazilian elections here we go portions of voice ...\nBoth NATO has been described by some as Donald Trump meets Filipino president or did he go to the ... and the light that he's turned the mainstream media into is useful enemies both NATO has a ten point lead in the polls in a country whose traditional parties have been stand by scandal\nA populist outsider has moved into the political vacuum\nOur starting point this week is one of the primary battle ground in this election the social media space in Brazil\nSay they are going to work without filter in Brazil they don't talk to him but also they don't ... them and they don't think that what if you and then you have\nTo you both for NATO spent years in the national assembly as a fringe politician before becoming a leader of a relatively small party which he's taken to the writer despite being the victim of a damning last month from which he says he's still recovering\nHis critics called him home before sergeant is both for NATO some supporters either don't find any of those things all the\nMore they don't believe them\nReporting on mainstream news because millions are getting their news straight from the camera\nOn what side or from his supporters\nHe was not the one to be the Internet as a medium to propagate the political campaign for the for the conservative coup found in the Internet's a medium to exchange information as without\nPutting their personal security endanger that you need to be the ideas that are so NATO managed to integrate into his campaign or does it will not be sensors on social media you know unlike what's happens on the mainstream idea where he has no voting\nLike happening but I think is that social media the taking\nOf having to have a favorite stuff outside the capital and no matter how\nWe can question that they can have it in which their support them\nAnd they can counteract what's happening even though there is some information available that\nTheir members of the real\nQuick to believe what their own tiny they all want that people support in a county as I say everything that goes against what they behave if it's an action is taken is\nOh that's quite looking out for me to cover the Brazilian elections notice to whether you want to say look I Believe what's going on there I don't but this uh open campaign has been going on for quite a long time just like the most open society CEO there's lots of public rallies there's lots of chances to to follow\nAnd it ... here in the United states we were told it two years ago a guy like Donald Trump can't make it and then he makes it and then it's over some type of a mistake or and then\nIf we just get rid of them are reverse it it's the same thing going on with breakfast were in ... people are still saying we're we just need to overturn it we just need to overturn it to a two and a half years we just need to take another vote and we get rid of all we can just go back to being normal what we continue to document for you on this program because we looked so far outwardly\nIs that this is not some story about a guy that saying oh you know we've got to forget Donald Trump in the elections under the guy that has the most traction going on right now is a guy that is clearly mimicking what Donald Trump in the breakfast folks did and he's getting traction\nYeah so the opposition say oh you're crazy you're that can't be but then we keep seeing it we keep seeing it and we keep seeing it whether it's in Italy whether it's in Hungary whether it's in Germany\nYou know these big open western societies we keep seeing evidence of it if not outright wins momentum and ... and ... momentum grows it doesn't doesn't decrease\nAnd yet all of our institutions tell us that's not going to happen\nOver and over and over again it's not going to happen it's not going to happen there's something wrong with the uh the voters there's something wrong with the system they must not have tallies the votes correctly or a Russia must have manipulated this\nUh it's over and over again I can I can assure you that in the United kingdom they still establishment these tablets which are still saying\nThere's a chance that we can just get rid of go back to and a half years ago and just reverse it because it was a mistake that vote that referendum by the citizens it must have been a mistake or literally it must have been a day in which everybody wasn't thinking clearly\nThe best we can still reverse ... and then of course the the carrot and all this is and then we're going to go back to where we were before which is so great for everybody\nStill going on\nOr at least story was NAFTA the new NAFTA Donald Trump or just about I mean it still has to get congressional ratification but just about\nA fulfilling another one of his campaign promises and of course we took a look took a look at it from the Mexican side and the Canadian side with some of our voices if you missed that the show will be archived you can go back and you can listen to it but\nHow did foreign media covered this story here in the United states nobody covered I mean I I mean our our establishment media didn't cover it because they were they say look our business model only worked with one\nThe story the hysteria and emotion is what usually we we we we play an insult Brett Kavanaugh all time only joined us the only story that we cover a joke you know something else comes along so NAFTA basically was ignored\nBecause think about if you're in the business of attracting the largest audience scale to the lowest common denominator kind of like McDonald's doesn't mean it's good or bad it's just the look your job is to scale to the largest audience\nNot to inform knocked practice journalism just scale which all middles run every street corner in the busiest Bush's rubber twenty four hours a day you know we don't have to get out of your car I mean they're scaling and that's what institutions do they scale\nAll to help your business thrive

provide an income stream that will last as long as we needed to sew on today's show\n... going to help us understand the various ways you can build lifestyle sustaining income to last you throughout your retirement Stephanie how important is the assurance that comes with knowing that hey we set up retirement from an income standpoint there were good to go for the rest of our lives our income is set\nYou know my clients telling me it's the biggest thing they hope to get out of creating a retirement plan the the greater the share of income that actually guaranteed in terms of timing and the amount the more confident that we can be about not running out of money in retirement and ... unfortunately a lot\nOf people don't feel very confident there's days when it when we're talking about went into retirement in fact I saw some survey results that show the mindset of ...\nThat many people who began working with me and according to this survey the number one retirement fear amongst workers fifty one percent of them set out living their savings and their investments to running out of money\nBasically running out of the means to generate an income stream\nAnd really that's due largely to the fact that employer funded pension plans so called defined benefit plans\nThey are disappearing quickly you know just over the last ... years we saw\nLoose it we've seen Ford the list goes on of these major corporations that are doing away with pension plans to do today only about two percent of workers and the private industry\nStuff and I would I Would think that a lot of listeners have the four oh one K. or an IRA so how do you take a a plan like that and then convert what that ... and then converted into a retirement income stream that's certainly much different than the old punching world isn't it\nOh my goodness yes and that really is that the next process income is paramount in retirement\nAnd you'll likely you know you've worked hard and CNET market these for one case we had an incredible right I mean they have grown we've benefitted by these these markets the question becomes\nHow do you make those savings work for you and retirement you're right pensions are going away we're not seeing that\nYou know what we are seeing though I Will tell you it again we see these for one case growing\nBut also well have people come in they will sit down and they will say OK I'm retiring I've got this four one K. oh by the way I've got this lump sum as well\nAnd I have two options I can take the lump sum and I can you know roll it out and put it into a nother IRA and decide what to do with it or I could take it\nAnd I could converted into an immediate annuity inside my company that will provide me a income stream for the rest of my life and so we'll talk about that will walk through that process and what it looks like\nSee typically Ninety plus percent of the time we can take a lump sum and we have the ability to still create an income stream that will outperform that income stream that that company is offering them on that\nImmediate annuities see the problem with that immediate annuity Marcus this\nIt's great it'll given the paycheck\nBut they've lost control of that lump sum it doesn't matter if they lived twenty more years or one more year five more years once they die that cash has gone they've lost all control of it\nSo it is a benefit for that company for you to take that immediate income 'cause they're not having to pay out the dollars so you want to be sitting down you want someone like us to help you determine what is best when it comes to that lump saw our should you take that immediate annuity\nSo when it comes to turning the IRA for on gay money's into income because that's really what we have to do is we got we have to have income to replace those paychecks stuff and so when it comes to moving them to an annuity for example\nOr into life in church or whatever where we're going to go wherever you want to create your own\nBasically you're trying to create your own pension basically so you have a monthly income coming in all the time and it's guaranteed you not gonna have to worry about it are there ways to do with the other than the immediate new to you know you sometimes you don't care for her new book maybe in some cases you do I don't know maybe in situations like this I'm not sure\nYeah immediate annuities again it's it's almost like a suicide of your money 'cause you're losing control of that cash now yes you're right we want to be able to create those income streams because\nLet's face it Social Security typically in itself is not enough to to keep up with both people in retirement just recently I was sitting down with a gentleman and his wife and they needed on top of their Social Security and additional forty thousand dollars\nA year to maintain retirement and you know their lifestyle now understand that forty thousand dollars right now marking ten years when you're taking a look and and thinking about inflation all of a sudden you're not needing forty thousand anymore you might be needing sixty thousand\nAnd then Twenty years you might need eighty thousand till we want to make sure that we are keeping up with inflation making sure that that income stream is increasing as inflation does an immediate annuities not going to do that but there are\nA new phase out there that do keep up with inflation again what's our primary purpose when using an annuity ... primary purpose is to be able to create an income stream\nWith then is that we don't want to lose control of our money we don't want to lose control of our\nBar cash but you've got to understand what's out there that's going to give you that income stream that's why it's so important to sit down with professionals
