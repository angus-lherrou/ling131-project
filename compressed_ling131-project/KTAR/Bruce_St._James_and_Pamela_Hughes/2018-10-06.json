raincoat for your stucco house and\nIn preparing a paint job\nOr in soliciting quotes from pay contractors just stuck or to pay the extra stuff what you're up there was a couple key phrases that y'all would need to know about in\nThat stuck on a surface\nParticularly if it's the heavy trials will cost skip drought texture it traps a lot of dirt we we tell people if your house is\nPainted a light color\nTake a dark rag if your house is painted dark\nTake a light rag and just go out and rub these stuck on the surface of the outside and if the paint pigment comes off on that how\nYou've reached the point that it's time to repay the paint has lost its elasticity\nThe UV rays are beginning to create an effort that shark surface on top of the pain and you've lost the router shedding whether proofing characteristics that the paint is engineered to provide you\nSo if you're pulling that off you can actually just rub your hand on the surface as well and you'll you'll see the ...\nWith the paint pigment that comes up and yes\nWe need to power wash all that chalk\nOff so the next layer of paying gets a good paint bard we also need to wash all the dust out of all the new books and the ...

getting quotes to do your homes ask your painters you'd like a back\nRoads paint job over stucco [noise]\nNow what you're going to find out is more a lot of painters have a lot of different definitions of what back really really is\nBack rolling is not spraying your wall taking a road or and then back row again you actually take your spray rig and you spray horizontally you spray vertically put two layers of coat of paint on\nAnd then someone with a five gallon bucket with three gallons of the same paint in there with the paint screen and a good one inch roller for at least that good services then\nDitched the rover him and that ... all of that area that has been sprayed\nTwice to directions\nThat back Rowley and if they're not zipping the roller in fresh paint and applying the paint on top of what's been sprayed there you're really not getting back ruled you're really not getting the stucco sealed up as well as you probably should you're really not getting the

probably do think for a minute what's going on with my car do I gotta squeak do I got a rattle do I get a driver's seat you know when you get into it the electric seat motor GM's you into the steering wheel every now and then I hate when that happens remember a planes trains and automobiles\n[laughter] when you watch way more movies of the bill back then I did but Steve Martin gets slander the dashboard of the car 'cause a Dell Griffith broke the seat or [laughter]\nFantastic movie [noise]\nHow do they know we're going yeah how do they know they've been drinking wow I I just must have missed that\nThey play it every Thanksgiving you can't miss it you know do anyway if you if you got something going in their car give us a call at six so to to seven seven five eight to seven they're starting to rule in uh we're going to go with Vinnie in global he's got a two thousand seven dodge Dakota how can you help us any Ron bumper to bumper radio\nA little background uh ten to twelve miles per gallon a hundred and fifty thousand miles on the\nVehicle got a check engine light or indicated it was a camp physicians censor intermittent ah replaced it and a engine light\nA went out I have this condition which I had before where uh I can you hear the transfer case a changing on that song when I open the doors are showing at random ... so\nWhat ... what motors and your dodged the four points that it later\nYeah she is\n... I mean first thing I hear tend to twelve miles a gallon that's that sounds awful but I'm I'm a little confused on the transfer tastes are shifting David you know\nI've never had that happen something else maybe actually waiting but literally the transportation shifting\n... well that's what I I'm assuming it is because it sounds just like when I put my four wheel drive on before in the past sounds like the same mechanism as being activated\nUh you don't have as soon Vinnie [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] no no I just I hear you give me oh you end up you end up doing radio with Matt out [laughter] so that's why I'm calling\nThat transmission is a forty five R. S. E. a transmission that's in there in that transmission makes noises got assume AIPAC then people here and they're like what is that noise and and so that may be something that's going on I I don't know I couldn't imagine that the transfer case would be doing something different\nMaybe you can go driving an experience something because it's a transfer case is doing different things it's going to drive different just cruise around in a parking lot\nWell but I'm going to look at it as many is that is symptoms something you're hearing are but we still have to check in with the camp censor issue arc or that circuitry correct\nNo that's taken close solve that okay\nThat's ... that I I replaced the\nThe ah the sensor can physician ... center I replaced it and that check in general I went away even before that condition showed up as a check engine\nEngine light I had that ah indication or act which here that transfer case I'm a ranking it's a transfer case and the reason I say that transportation is because I Know\nIt goes into a four wheel drive on its own because I can feel oh we won't turning around turning acting and so I'm On a laptop you can hear the wheels all four wheels\nHuh that's real yeah so there are there's our symptom then so you know of any I don't try see transmission is you know although it's it's a way I mean Tempe inmates are a little ways away from globe but I think as you come into the valley from that part of town\nIt's probably about the best place you can come across to to to have somebody take a look at that but I Would think engaging into Fort will drive automatically that confirms your suspicion or something with that transfer case that you know that can be bad news going down the road sixty or Seventy miles an hour and it just\nLot of people to understand this but in a car there's an engine control module or a body you know I'm Sorry\nOr a body you know I'm Sorry a power train control model that has a lot of information and transfer case information generally isn't in there so you know you gotta check engine lights for the engine there is also there was also air messages for the transfer case so when you go to the auto parts store they're not actually getting into the transportation brain\nYeah they're they're they're tool can't open the door it's only got one key not multiple keys speak\nSo yeah there could be a you know there's transportation problems and there's transfer kids control promised transfer case control prompts tend to be the most\nCommon issues that are out there so anyhow bumper to bumper radio dot com if you're looking for a good shot many ah thanks for the phone call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven let's go with John and Phoenix he's got a Nineteen Ninety Land Rover how can we help you John you're on bumper to bumper radio\nYeah I got one um got a hundred and sixty thousand miles on a truck and what I'm going it's normally what is going up health stumbles above three thousand rpm and just looking to see a show called or is it something that an an ignition for ...\n... so just just a stumbling on it I kind of grade or just on a flat level with a\n... it'll be flat flat level but I mean really only time I get a lot of trees out in our family nothing is going up el ... but if I'm going ah about three thousand dark and it starts to stumble that at that point at like losing power right I have to back it up and come back at like five hundred rpm before it picks up against like actually drive\nBut if you just ... what would happen\nOr it just stumbles that keeps I'm like I have to do with the information that we have we can to a ball confetti\nIn there and pick up a piece of paper with a note on it and gas that I mean and and so really someone that it's got some experience and there's a certain see the Europeans feel Dave ... you know 'cause this is not a sophisticated car this is only this is a Nineteen Ninety\nA rover so there's not a whole lot of computer aided things in there to go to diagnose I mean a new car has on board diagnostics to which is you know Ninety six and newer\nAnd ... and that older landrover is not going to be is is sensitive to failures is not going to put on an engine code for miss fire so this is one where we might be able to go get some clothes out of it and get us and the right direction and whether or not the check engine light is on or not\nWe need to look at some of the data and this is one of the ones where it's like we used to call put it on the scope we go to ...\nAnd ... you know he has about feel pressure in in in ... I'm never won for throwing a fuel pump it anything you know you know I'm always feel pressure is so easily checked in most situations there's yeah there's a there's generally ... feel pressure gauge uh to be able to check that but I mean rather than just\nThrowing parts that there are steps we can take you say you know the fuel pump looks great\nYou know you didn't even electrically test in scope out of fuel pumps to see if it's weak well\nYou look at the ... to ... electrical portion but you've got the you know the pumping portion but it could be it could have the right pressure\nBut guess what when you want more fuel it falls is safe because it doesn't have the volume maybe the filters thought that maybe there's nothing wrong with had enough maybe that's what our position censor\nYou know the computer wants to see how far your foot sudden the gas and there's a risk that in there\nIf there's a there's a glitch in a certain spot and it's not going to like that you could have a ignition coil coil wire breaking down you could have injector was too high resistance they're drawing too much on the computer to\nMaking it a limb motor making it's not a one of ... so many things need to classic card needs to be diagnosed\nOr the old days just pull and pull in the bay put it in gear power break it spread some was free some water over the wires seemed breakdown right [laughter]\nSo yeah seat of the parents feel sure appreciate the call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven we come back we're taking more phone calls in a case of course you're Texas for one one nine to three or listen to ... guys on bumper to bumper radio [noise]\n\nHonesty and integrity is the only option Hi Spencer do say for aging die automotive ages for honesty and I asked for integrity we built our business on these two principles we opened our first shopping Mesa in two thousand nine and with the support from are loyal customers we've now grown to a second state of the art location in Gilbert\nTwo locations same principles quality service at a great value backed by an industry leading sixty sixty thousand miles parts and labor warranty check it out at age in automotive dot com\nOr diesel foreign or domestic if you're ... steps are closing line pops into Jeff just reinforcing that were full service or refer at courtside repair we do it all including diesel\nWe have the passion training expertise for diesel our techs are ... certified for diesel advance diesel diagnostics toy hall\nIgnacio ... toward hauling horse trailing off ruining or worked trucking we've got you covered gas or diesel foreign or domestic if your car hurts ticket the Kurt trucks out at my car hurts dot com\nOh life is good news up and go a little bad news right Hi Dave ... on a tri city transmissions and co hosted bumper to bumper radio car repair scenes to follow that same trend\nThe good news transmissions are lasting twice as long as they used to the bad news they can cost as much as a thousand dollars more than you might remember\nIn the steering wheel I can feel whenever I turn right low speeds right\nNow does that have a hydra boost unit or does it have a vacuum assist breaks\nYou know I wouldn't know it\n... probably back you know there's some of those there's even though it's not a disorder I think there's some of those that had the hydra boost I Believe [noise]\nYou know I'd be looking for something maybe rubbing on the steering column um you know or even the steering shaft underneath under the hood I'm just a little bit of vibration go in one direction I Know some of those in that vintage had asked during ... we used to replace a lot but that was more fair for clunky noise\nDave one of the things that I Would I Do Patrick if I'm looking for a string always I'm just going to dry stew that car or something and drive I'm just going to dry steer it in a you know ... back and forth to really help diagnose it\nIn a honestly with does it up you know you see a power string line that didn't get both the down from the last repair and that ... can somebody or vibration so it may not and you know may not be the serious power steering repair but someone's going to need to be under the hood with us during his in motion to really see what's going on in the dry yeah and I\nCheck there's there's been like a no drops of liquid anywhere there's no leaks or anything it\nJust kind of came on\nYeah I'm ... I'm I'm kinda thinking that that's what I what I mean by drives during ... during the car without movement\nSo I'm stopped in Oregon all day but the engines running engine is running I'm stirring it back and forth and and I got somebody it's it's a two person job when you're looking for power sharing though is is there somebody underneath the hood looking and there's someone in the car stern back and forth or in the steering always just for fun\nTough but they're yeah because so many different things I mean but he at least he's feeling it to the column I mean ... could be a bearing or one of the Bush ... and the calm and the other thing with the steering anytime you have two people working in the car\nYou know communicate there'll be having your fingers and somebody else you know I I get nervous get the keys out of the ignition I Want to in my pocket if there's somebody sitting in the car makes sure using safety stands if you're working on the car yourself and you know that powers to and you got your finger on the wrong spot and some in terms of we'll\nThere and it gets ... yeah yeah yeah so it's just just be cautious any of you who are the IRS offers and and try and this stuff on your own\nThanks for the call Patrick six so to to seven seven five eight to seven and they go with the text here this person had the two thousand ten Nissan ex Tara\nThey have to add ... more often than they think and a ... a smell they ... through the ace events it almost has a metallic since what could this be mad I Know you've got a good guess on the\nUh yeah it's probably hear or you know going back to get that that smell maybe some some stuff on the dash you know what are the heat of course that you get to this film on them and then the other thing you look at\nBe careful and the ex terrorists or they have a plastic here core feeding that sticks to the marvel\nMan we don't even want to change the here has on these things as Rick you touch them and this plastic deteriorates I think just breaks and then you're you're you're pulling the dash apart and and the replacement one is all aluminum I suspect that that's that that's something that's leaking all those symptoms dad right up to that for sure\nWell let's go ahead and try Dan again in Phoenix he's got a two thousand six Mazda three go ahead Dan you're on bumper to bumper radio\n[noise] hey guys warning how can we help ya well\nMy two thousand six most of the three the field poll point out in it back in January\nAnd replaced it successfully in its run great but now when I turn the key I get nothing I don't hear run and the voltage that I'm reading at the pump which is under the seat reading about eight points revolt and I'm Wondering if that's if that's lower than\nIt's lower than battery voltage and I'm Wondering if that's the way the whole point or went out prematurely\nYeah you know there's got to be a fuel pump relaying there and that if that really is going I could see low voltage getting dumped I mean some stuff like that but I'd be tests enough that circuit to see 'cause I don't think I don't think pumps to run it enables\nModulate it might be a ... so that's what they say it when we say modulate their duty cycle you know most pumps they just get turned on the run in full\nBlast you know that all all the power they can\nProduce they're sending more fuel to the engine engine can possibly use and then there's a regulator\nAnd then there's a regulator there and a return line that returns that line back to think\nWhat we're seeing more and more and more and it very well could be in the six months I'm not saying that does or doesn't 'cause I just can't remember that one off the top of my head\nBut the fuel systems in many cases now are just one line there's a pressure line there is no return line and they regulate the fuel pressure by modulating power to the fuel pump\nSo it very well may only want eight volts sit idle I kinda doubt it\nBut you need to understand the system before we testing for power\nYeah exactly yeah for sure so see if you can get a some sort of some sort of explanation of how that system works and once you understand the concept of how the system works and then you can diagnose it but until you understand that you really shooting in the dark\nYou know and then the resources for people who are fixing some cars and their own all data that is a company that many shops uses subscribe to their services it's\nSeveral hundred dollars a month to have complete access but as a homeowner or or you know to be home and her but as a consumer you can sometimes make thirty bucks or something like that get it get access to that for a period of time and you really have to understand the theory in operation of the system\nOr you know to to go in and start diagnosing it it's time for\nAll right you know being that it's ... a month and we're really going to take care of our baby a out there and I'm thinking I'm thinking I just want to put nicer gas in this month because it is Kara Kara month\nWhy not put a little nicer gas in there I normally get to eighty seven because it's cheap and an cheap but you know it's a little extra love it's way so\nI'm going to put some high octane in my car is that is that a good idea I I say it's a good idea that factor fiction\nI don't know which is the fact in reality I don't know if you're a truce Dave isn't there by my truth I I Know that is a big old fat F for fiction\nEsquire fiction not a good idea so you're not doing good your car to put in nice of you\nKnow the ... and you know it it's gotten a taste buds um the car will become less efficient it doesn't it doesn't burn at the proper rate the indigenous designed for a certain type of fuel\nIf you're putting a high octane fuel and your car because it pains or something else going on yeah just suddenly you're ... problem by by by putting in higher acting feel so you've got you've got to cure the problem is the correct in the symptom with with with a with a better gasoline most all the gasoline is now or a um talk to your fuel\nAnd so that's going to have the carbon cleaning properties and in in additives in detergents in there so you don't need to worry about that too much but no stick with whatever the sticker on the gas or says it says high octane fuel put it in there that's what it's designed\nTo run on you know and the

there's something about getting out of the city something about leaving the rat race something about the simplicity of standing in the middle of the metal ... son a set hearing even though I Can't stand the wolves hearing wolves going here and help you willing\nJust something that stripped down to to to what we are truly about in our soul and we forget about all that\nIn consequential things that we deal with on a daily basis that are the most important things in our lives at the time oh my gosh you got to call this person back or we got to get this thing done sometimes you just gotta get away man it it's so cleansing it feels so good\nVery expensive but fantastic\nIs there's no doubt in his mind that um you know it's a iron tight\nYou know the open and shut case\nYou're still going on then you still going to lie on the goodness gracious you got to go to court you're going to spend fifty two hundred thousand dollars just going through a trial and\nThat's and that's the way we wanted to have the option to go after a court court fees as well as a lawyer for you\nSo how do you avoid all of this stuff I mean if somebody's out there because of what could happen the Arizona California anyway what do you do you I mean\nThey came down quite substantially from a two hundred fifty thousand are asking the mediation but um you know we're we're holding tight to are are you know to our number which is zero [laughter] you know\nIt's it is what it is and it's not because you're trying to be stingy it's because you're if you're doing the right completely on the phone down\nAnd do faulted at in any way and you don't have all your spending you know you you you did this fraudulent Lee you knew that was going on you knew that this was going to happen and it's just all garbage is just the all weather patterns yeah it's a complete garbage and um you know they're they're working for their client and\nYou know sometimes you gotta you gotta just stick up for yourself and do the right thing to probably could I walked away and said okay take twenty grand or something like that and and they probably would have taken it probably would have been cheaper in the long run but sometimes it's just principal\nAnd um you know they're they're they're basically this is\nLegalized ... the extortion ... that's what it is yeah it is and and uh it's frustrating when you when you deal with something like this um you know and I've gotten a lot better at it when it's completely out of your control and completely frivolous and\nUm you know and you know it's just a money grab a for the lawyers and for the people that moved into that house they know they're in the wrong they knew what was wrong with that house and they didn't do anything about it and and ah\nAnd then that for something to happen and then that you know nobody takes any self you know they don't blame themselves and has to be somebody else's fault and\nAnd um you know I I just it just drives me nuts sometimes there's almost no personal responsibility there whatsoever\nMaybe there's no way to avoid this especially if you do enough houses or you're gonna run into a situation like this but what you very far but you've got to protect yourself exactly and that's what we\nDid is you know we had the uh we had the agent that that protected us so you you know we we we've been in the business we've been around the block a couple of times so we knew what kind of rivers to put in there\nUh we gave them what they asked for a you know obviously we'd never to know that they weren't going to fix the problems that were you were out yeah that they're outlined by the inspector of which we didn't have any idea that that was a case it was a it was a trust that was\nUm it was cut that shouldn't have been cut that wasn't it wasn't something that we did it was something that somebody else did prior to us buying it\nAnd I'm In that trust needed to be fixed and they never fixed it and it's right there in the inspection for all the sea and they outlined it for it to be fixed and um and we were going to fix that and they said instead of doing that just give us seven grand and we did\nAnd uh and then that dress failed and you know there you go now that's our fault I guess and by the way it was six seven months after they closed on it so\nIt's just frustrating I'm dealing with with people that are not reasonable and I'm In er aren't and don't take any personal responsibility and it it uh it this business is so great in so many ways and I own my you know everything financially to real estate and and um I met some wonderful people doing it and\nBut you know what these these experiences are so interesting to me you know going through that process of mediation and and being in the room and having this a as a judge going back and forth and trying to mediate it and and trying to get two people that are completely opposed it's like I'm having a Democrat and Republican\nGroups have tried to get the degree to one side the Trump is on king and the other side the Hillary\nAnd that's what they do is cause it coming to you and they go well you know there's a chance at the other side could win you might want to hear that they then they go to the other side you know like you know what you're asking for quite a bit you got a pretty weak case here\nIt's a that's exactly what they do go back and forth back and forth and and\nAnd uh you know the we did five hours or whatever to do eight hours and I'm like why would\nThey know versus five hours and it's it's\nIt's a it's nobody which costs
