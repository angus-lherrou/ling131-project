the west so you need a we're having an event and we expected happen sometime in in this hour\nYeah it's going to be a very busy day for the president or in the valley with things coming to a head around six thirty tonight out at Mesa gateway where there will be a rally where the president is\nStumping for candidates for senator there Martha make salad bars you know that's the big one I think that's a big one so we wanted to get an inside look we wanted to peel the curtain back a bit we know what's going to be a very busy day\nFor the president but how does he prepare for rallies like the one that's going to happen\nOut in Mesa this evening so to help us peel that courting back is currently went down ... the name you're probably familiar with he is the former Trump campaign manager and he joined us right now I live on the ... a A R news make aligned good morning to you\nGood morning to you so Cory when when Trump goes into one of these uh and and you were with him during the campaign specifically when he would hold these events these rats\nWhen when Trump goes into one of these uh and and you were with him during the campaign specifically when he would hold these events these rallies uh I think that you guys called ... as well um\nIs they're prepared script and how quickly to he throws the prepared script away [laughter]\nWell you as you know we always have preparations in place and sometimes the best laid plans you know don't go the way that you expect\nBut with this candidate and now with this president\n... the way we are prepared him in the past I Believe it continues to be that way as a speech has written a for the specific event that will be attending it will talk about specific issues that are important to the local area or to the specific state the president also received a briefing document which outlines\nAll of the readers who are going to be greeting him at the airport who they are what function they have he knows most of the people already but as a formality I Would say as an example governor do see would be there or whoever the other individuals are there to greeting him\nHe'll be given a line by line document which outlines what his expectations are where he is going what his day looks like in advance and then uh in addition to that he'll have an opportunity to review the speech which has written so that he can make any changes before it's loaded into the teleprompter\nNow all that being said as you know many times when the president has the opportunity to be reading from the teleprompter he will just go accent brainy us he'll just disregard whatsoever in there and he'll start using lines that either were not prepared or\nAre not vetted by somebody else and then the staff just deals with it and we call that let Trump Trump and it seemed to have been working out pretty well\nCorey Lewandowski former campaign manager for President Trump then candidate Trump now joining us right now live on the PTA our news maker in line\nAnd and ... you just said that you know a speech is prepared and it takes us to focus on the areas of interest specific to an area or a state you're in the valley of this on the president's here in the valley of this on immigration is a huge issue for our state is a huge issue for this country\nHey well I'm appreciate you coming in today you facing the music on a certain level or the flat ... already a an ounce today they offensive coordinator fired from the cardinals after the anemic\nOffensive I'm a performance although you can certainly make an argument it wasn't like the defense was even doing much of a job of slowing down Denver although Denver's defense\nAlso scored two touchdowns yeah it's been a problem all you're of course the Russian defense for the Arizona Cardinals and I said this from the very beginning from the first game they were going to play if in fact\nThere was going to be a break down with her rushed defense if they weren't able to actually shut down and other team from running\nThat it would set off a chain reaction where this team would eventually get to a point where they're probably wanted six and it's because\nIt would make their quarterback one dimensional Sam Bradford has gone he's been long gone Josh Rosen of course is now the quarterback but he's still a rookie he's not meant to be in a one dimensional law fence\nThe fences failed overall because it just was not able to put him in a three dimensional office where you run it where you throw it and you use play action and that's been a problem but it's all it's all something that's been needed together in a one in six mass\nTalking to Iran woefully herring and Enron you know you're you're what the team a lot color analysts and you travel with the team you know the team while you walked in here just a few moments ago your exhaust that do man you're exactly how this team doing right now\nYou know the teammates not doing well to tell you the truth and if you just looked at the performance last night from this team ... I saw team that was not prepared I saw team that was not ready to play in a in particular I Would say the ... the way that it started guys one of the worst starts you have to know I have a PHD in losing\nMy view okay I Know I've\nPlayed on a lot of bad or teams okay ten years in the NFL never played on a winning team I Know what it's like to go out there and struggled but oh my goodness the way the ...\nThe first three plays right they got stuff done first intend got stuff by a defense that has been historically bad in terms of stuffing the run or trying to stop the run but having said that once again it's only one place you break the huddle on the second play and suddenly\nNobody knows where to line up they didn't know where to light up you had to call it time out on the second\nPlace I can tell you the ... list do they play right those are the games are rip\nSeven to ten place somewhere in there you script the first ten plays\nYeah I mean the list solely play right those are the games are repeated\nSeven to ten place somewhere in there you script the first ten plays and suddenly your team knows what they are and you blow it on the second play bass told me there were some real problems and it only got worse from there\nRon willfully cardinals redo analyst and goes to that like an old show in Ninety seven in ... Arizona sports station I I'm not asking you to betray anything I this is a this is a damning statement I'm prepared to make and I know that it strikes me that the players quit at some point\nI I think you're going to argue with me they didn't even if they didn't quit then they're the wrong players how ... which which one is do you know what I'm saying listen I'm not the effort that the Broncos\nRide totally agree with that I absolutely agree that the damning come here to say about it and it's it's an unspeakable thing to say no listen not every one of 'em could of course not every one of them are stuck it never is like that\nBut you got to wear this if you are a player there's no doubt about it the responsibility\nStarts with you everyone started about all the lack of creativity on often listen when you hear somebody say that just know deep down inside they really don't know what they're\nOkay and the only reason why I say that is is\nYou can have the most basic often it's on the face of the planet but if you were executed\nIf you've got good players often somewhere defensively you get the most base screams in the history of the football universe\nAnd if you were execute that stuff it's go to work I mean it's going to work yeah trust me on that if you're going to be glorified for what a brilliant human being you are because you didn't insert yourself and your own creativity into the blood you're just like your players play [laughter] see how it works it's just\nWill sit there is such a thing as creativity there's nothing wrong with being creative just don't act like it's a panacea the adult beer all of what it's going to take to win games\n'cause it's not real quickly with Byron not which means that it out with ... or promoted defensive coordinator the fence scheme doesn't change just the guy calling the planes does what can cardinal fans expect fundamental difference honestly I think\nMore of what Bruce areas to\nMove the vote of all them foreign left which quarterback under I remember when he was a quarterback by the way we may see more of that and less of what\nWe have to go get an app go get an out of hand you've earned that\nThank

the meetings and in ... and whatnot\nAre not as much public stuff there the the rally if you want to say will be tonight where he is expected to endorse or other than just on Twitter a local candidates are specifically Martha ... in her close race for Senate or we also expect\nGovernor do seem to be there can I just point out that\nI'm I'm going to this is what I'm watching what governor do she says he will give some remark justice yeah yeah we're going to do the stand on stage with Donald Trump was that a big deal you\nI don't think he will okay so it doesn't I think that's something the book I'm going to see what does it say I think it says that he's still concerned enough about reelection but he doesn't\nHe wants to be in Trump's orbit but not too close\nBecause Trump of course will say things on stage the juicy than doesn't want to have to say\nI disagree with reselling has no problems [laughter] ... yeah I I think I think ... has enough of a lead if you believe any of the the data out there\nThat maybe he doesn't have to tie himself to Trump's him\nShow the rally tonight doors are going to open up at three thirty out at Phoenix makes a gateway airport there and my son\nThat's about three hours before the start of the event now if you do not have a ticket or if you don't feel like standing around and one of these free speech patterns of which\nWill get to in just a moment there is one of the argument of why I and I know we'll get there there's the second or you're gonna be able to hear it right here on Katie a are we will be carrying it live for you and then ... and shell is going to be sticking around after that rally in and breaking it down for a little bit further with\nAll the resources we have at Katy are behind that show [noise]\nIf you are going out and you don't have a ticket chances are you're going to be assured into one of two they're calling it free speech zone like\nFree speech pen than on that more and so what are we talking about here well we talked to\nMesa police chief ... about this the venue Phoenix Mesa gateway airport is very different than the one the last time the president came into town August twenty second which was down at the Phoenix convention center mhm you've got a lot of public roads\nAround there you know people are allowed to be on sort of have to follow the laws and listen to the police direction but it's a little different out at me as the gateway degrees of private property and so because of that here is what chief ... says will happen if you don't have a ticket we've\nA segregated or or created two large large free speech\nRange where folks can make their own determination about what side of the aisle they want to they want to stand in and that's going to be for it for folks that don't have a ticket\nOf course the venue itself can hold about four thousand spectators are but we are expecting more than that and if they decide to attend and that being supported the president will there'll be an area for that\nUh and if they're there are a position as otherwise there's a there's an area for that\nDo you know if you're a widow word and say\nI'm going to show up they have to give me the big goofy oversized check that will fit in the ATM you gotta get your picture taken your everywhere and everybody knows\nThat you're now stinking filthy rich why\nWe change our laws here but they're not as good as other places in my opinion so we've got six states Delaware Kansas Maryland North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina where winners are allowed to remain anonymous indefinitely\nWe've had the court cases because of this and one of the arguments who's been and I I'm all let's just assume they're being genuine about this argument because I Do think there is somebody said for it is\nIt's a risk to their safety my gosh yes but you go from average Joe or Jane to suddenly that person has five hundred million dollars there is a safety issue\nJane to suddenly that person has five hundred million dollars there is a safety issue and some people I think the real reason is one remaining anonymous so every third cousin that needs a liver transplant doesn't show up on your front door\nSell them for cash Arizona we have a new law about a year and a half or so old and it says if you win six hundred dollars or more in the six hundred dollars that come\nI mean I mean I Want to remain anonymous because I was six hundred bucks right seriously [laughter]\nIf you will do you live with anybody [laughter] I've got six hundred bucks\nSix hundred dollars in taxes aren't as a three hundred dollars I mean God I ... you can be walking around that kind of cash you can't remain anonymous for yeah Ninety Days ... after the prize is awarded now you also have\nUp to a hundred and eighty days to come forward and collect that prize so radically in Arizona you couldn't remain anonymous for\n[noise] nine months interesting after that your name is going to be public now
