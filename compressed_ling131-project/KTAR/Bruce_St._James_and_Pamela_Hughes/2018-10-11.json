family issues\nYou know our our news department as fancy titled for everything you know and they're digging into in a closer look at proposition\nArizona votes yeah yes we call this prompts were done that's all we're all\nBecause a payload I both we both will by mail do we yeah you both vote by mail or are getting our ballots this week in the mail you're supposed to be getting them back yellow on below\nAnd there are of five different propositions that you can vote on every day this week at ten o'clock we've been digging into a different prop using our wonderful Katie our news team that has been doing research on me\nAnd the reason why we wanted to do research and we wanted to dive into these is because when you get your ballot there will be a description\nAnd I don't feel like the description properly describes what the ballot does do stew you Bruce prop thrill five five missile thrilled by this is the pit bull proposition when you get your ballot prop thrill five is going to be described like this\n[noise] the law expand eligibility for education empowerment scholarship accounts to increase the number of eligible students enrolled in kindergarten through twelfth grade with greater funding provided for low income students\nSounds like a scholarship program for low income students\nDoes that I was going to see who can who's opposed to that it doesn't sound like somebody who could be vehemently opposed\nBut it doesn't properly describes the prop we bring in\nAlexander from the KTLA our news department to properly describe the prop sides so highly gives me the bottom line definition of what prop thrill five represents\nBasically it's something that's already in place is a vote yes were to occur on prop thrill five it would expand the eligibility so like you were saying and like Brits would say it's hard to vote against saying a child should not get this because they have\nA disability or their parents are in the military or something along those lines this is already in place if prop ... passes it expand that to all one point one million students in Arizona\nSo go ahead so basically it would be anyone could apply for this\nOkay the scholarship account is a voucher program in the state of Arizona ... well it means that you get money from taxpayers and you can take that wherever you want to go to educate your child we already have a lot of different\nOpportunities in Arizona for education you know whether it's for public education charter schools\nHome schools private schools but what this would do in essence would you would get say five thousand dollars\nAnd again I don't know the numbers would I don't have a child at length about you'll be able to get about five thousand dollar out that's about the price tag the state of Arizona puts on every\nNow it's like that's less less but you would take you get about five thousand dollars in\nEvery public education student would be able to take that five grand and go to a private school and the idea of paper to tuition and\nYou're going to take that\nThat child in the underperforming de ... at school and give them the opportunity to go to a private school here's the thing folks those that are currently currently using the yeah yes yeah Seventy five percent of them\nThat is in some ways replacing cars that we drive and in other ways replacing the idea that you need your own car\nYou bought your last car you don't know me not strange to me okay why you've got\nThe tank analysts out there and they're predicting that in about Twenty years okay so I have about my last ... right now we may stop owning cars okay how ... why would I not own a car we can teleport oh we're going to tell you Scott oh that would be awesome\nYou know and we're married or a car so many of us are married to our car your car with a hard on your identity flexibility to go where you want to wait on you want to go\nYeah absolutely so what they're saying here though it's pretty simple they're just saying that self driving electric vehicles and they're organizing like in an ... style network okay they'd be able to offer transportation so yeah that\nYou'll decide you don't need a car any more I'm I see this happening\nAlready and I'm not just talking about ... lift replacing cabs but you know for some people in some cities I'm\nBasing over his car you know what I'm saying they only pay for what they use\nIt in yeah you know initially I go to to the big cities you know I go to like New York where so many that live in a city don't\nOwn car so I was like well I mean it's cost prohibitive\nNot just the cost of the car and insurance but you're looking at where are you going to park or something in the gang in New York one of the various things I ever did was parking garage in New York so you've got to walk so fast back to the garage where they've decided it's it's just not worth it so they get cars to go everywhere\nAre we going to get to that point in the near future\nTo give an example of of an interesting technology that I saw in California this was a a rental car so I mean it's still a car you wouldn't it by the minute\nYou rent a car but it's
