the opposite I'm not worried about the major stuff because like we've had to go to the ER for you know my you know a scraping a bump and they pick up the tab for everything it's more the ongoing care there is um you know it's very hard to find providers who take it there's a bit of a stake then we feel\nA little strange having that kind of coverage given our own financial position you know that our kids are on a um there's a bit of a stigma that oh I don't feel having it so it's just it's just kind of a dilemma we face every year and\nI and you are you know in November we can make if they offered you a a you know free food stamps because you are adopted a foster child you know that would feel the same way as what you're saying um it would\nYeah I mean I well I don't look at you and he has to get a ...\nType and that takes care of their you know their their financial needs and um so I don't know this is not an easy\nNow which is a question and does it cost to add them to your husband's policy\nUm I think it would be nothing given the policy Ron has a high deductible each has a plan that we have and there's no cost ... and Emily\nAnd why is it a question if it doesn't cost anything and it's better coverage\nThat's a good answer there probably isn't a as an question I guess the only question would be just changing jobs in the future if he were to leave it you know you know go somewhere else\nYou know I mean you you just have to cover your kids from then on you're gone yeah you're done goes you opted out you know I don't know you might be able to go back again if something got crazy but um but for now you could opt out okay for that matter I guess yes for that matter I don't know that you have to opt out do you\nThat's a little unclear we were told you know kind of ... on our adoptions and you know final is Asian that that it's kind of an all or nothing thing if you add a secondary insurance than a Medicaid gets a little squarely but\nMedicaid well so what if there were a lot less everyone squarely so my point is if you're not using them and their squarely there was no squirrel yeah good point [laughter] you know so I Would I wouldn't tell them I Would add it\nAnd then you can choose which one you want to use from time to time and it's like you've got the big coverage and you can drop the squirrel okay because I wouldn't bring it up as long as you're not as long as you're not doing anything to interface with the Medicaid system then they're not even going to know\nAnd your own anything wrong because you're not taking money you know I mean you're just you're just not activating the squirrel\nYeah yeah and I mean I guess as long as we're not using it there you\nKnow there are not even going to have some yeah they want to notice now and then if you step back and start using it they might notice and then they might have something and if they do and it causes a problem just lean back over on your husband's policy at that point\nYeah our pay the bill like we would have to anyway yeah I Would just I I think I Would just put 'em on there didn't cost anything which put him on that plan and start using that plan and then if you ever want to reach back over to medicate on the shoulder for something you've got that as an option\nOkay yeah I mean again it's it's great for these you know emergencies but the ongoing care which is you know the thing we need once or twice a year and it's just miserable\nMhm mhm Oh absolutely yeah and it feels\nWeird to even have it I mean it's just frankly just bizarre to to present that as an option to a doctor when we go into a doctor's office\nYou know I hear your what's your household income it's variable but it's north of two fifty oh no I wouldn't I wouldn't screw with that I'm with you OK yeah and I put them on\nThe husband's plan and news I just leaves sitting over there in Ninety nine point nine percent of the time you're not going to have him on the shoulder anyway and don't worry about\nOkay okay well that sounds good that's good advice and it gives us a plan for November when we have to make this decision the good news it doesn't cost anything it's exactly I and and
