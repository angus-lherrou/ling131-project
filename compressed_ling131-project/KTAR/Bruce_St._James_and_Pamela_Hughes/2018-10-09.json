G. A. R. news [noise]\nGet some perspective Bruce ... genes and family issues KGAN news on Ninety two three of them [noise]\nThere is a serious\nIssue out there that effects absolutely every one man woman and child regardless of what country you live in regardless of political affiliation regardless of the socioeconomic status yet it get surprisingly little attention to him and\nThe kids surprisingly a little attention for I think of a righty of reasons we're talking about climate change global warming\nAnd we're talking about this new un report that has come out that says there's going to be extreme weather millions in packed dead in the world has just over a decade to get it under control that seems pretty dire right down if true\nUm it seems pretty dire and it seems like it would be the biggest story in the world you might think yes\nYou don't hear a lot about it now we can talk about why don't you hear a lot about it I think part of it as\nIn today's day and age the news cycle moves so fast it turns out a constant stream of stories with sensational angles with immediate implication this is a slow moving crisis that affects everyone on the planet that it's really hard to kind of keep your eyes on for too long and then also here ...\nBecause people I think people running through the filter of how does this affect me today at lunch\nAnd then here in the United states we have the Republican Party which is one of the few major political organizations in the world that rejects the basic scientific consensus on this\nSo you get a lot of different things at play we do research here uh KTLA are on the topics that you guys care about and I'll tell ya routinely climate change follow the less All right so why are we taking some time to talk about it today\nWell because these are some pretty stark findings that the un has come back with and um they're going to require some major changes\nShiny one scientist or forty countries have compiled this landmark study for the United nations and it has found that we have just over eleven years that climate change under control in order to avoid catastrophic flooding devastating draft and the mass extinction of animals across the globe\nYeah I'm I'm I think probably be the impact on the weather is the one that people will feel kind of most quickly I'm now there are people out there getting that deny science they deny gravity they you know I I get it you know that this is a real um I just kept those people again science is real\nGet science is real whether or not you believe in it\nThat things like ocean levels rising things like storms being more severe things like temperatures being more extreme either on the high or the low end\nIs happening again whether or not you believe in it's a relevant it's still happening and people are gonna start feeling that my worry is that until they actually feel that until it impacts you specifically\nYou know relatives family friends or more they limited solution right until they can find a more permanent solution car\nShow okay we have one hundred individuals that that made their way to this church released by ice accompanied by ice\nWhy now because it's not as though we have stories every single week of busloads of immigrants being dropped off at churches what changed recently that this massive amount of individuals' ended up at the church right so\nWe're being told by ice that the um are keeping these families and detention centers but there comes a point where they just cannot keep them in detention centers\nUh before you know it's no longer legally allowed for for them to to to stand these detention centers especially 'cause we're dealing dealing with our kids and there's a limit of time that you can detain these kids so ice is releasing them\nA while their cases are pending so these families they're gonna have to check in with ice every so often um it doesn't mean that they're just going to be released and that's it they're going to have to be continuing to check in with I\nThere are still a program or a plan in place but but that plan ...\nIs it is it fair to see the point I'm a little murky but it's it's not nearly as cut and dry as it may it may sound in some of them do staffing issues some of it has to do with communication some of it has to do with the fact that these families may scatter and relocate anywhere around the country\nYeah there's no limits in terms of you know where they can go out they could go obviously they have to stay within the u._s.\nUm and um check in with ice every every so often but yeah there they they can even go to with families that are not even a in the country legally I'm so they're they're not really restrained aware or who they can stay with\nUs from the Katie our news team joining us right now to talk about these immigrant families seeking asylum that were released by ice um okay so they are released on it's called like a humanitarian what is the humanitarian parole something along those lines\nIf if the asylum seeker does not check back in with ice just lab that boils into the community [noise] right I mean it it'd be\nPretty hard to track these down these individuals' down I mean they do have to say I'm going to stay with this family member this individual but I'm oftentimes because just because of the lack of a they don't they don't have enough people looking into these cases\nIt was this was a customs and border with dry ice can't possibly like a find a person to track all\nRight it's it's a lot of work so uh but they are a ... if they if they don't show up to their court hearing um it could lead to their deportation\nOkay Griselda thank you very much for your time we shouldn't think of her being there again that was the scene outside shuttle rock United Church of Christ yesterday as\nA a couple of um of ice immigration buses showed up and dropped off roughly a hundred people men women and children are at the church because the court said life can ultimately on them\nNow I mean this is something that this church routinely does maybe not to the capacity to seems to be a lot of families that are that were dropped off they sometimes we'll see you know twenty twenty five to get a hundred yeah that's that's going to bring some resources but we\nHave another example I mean regardless of how you look at it I Can't imagine anybody thinks like\nWell this is this is a system works it's obvious was just some of those\nWere again regardless of what you think about what we think this is the best [noise]\n\nUse from driving women away from a GOP all the last three to register to vote in the seat of Arizona [noise]\nWe're women headed at least politically we will talk about if it's coming up next on Arizona's new station
