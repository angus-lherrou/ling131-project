R.\nNews reporter mark Carlson and to help us understand mark what exactly does prop three oh six do here in Arizona he'll pressure\nWhat do you think I Know\nI Hope so well it's another attempt to make changes to clean elections which has been around for Twenty years uh there are forces out there that would just like to see cleaned elections go away\nIs clear I was going to say we find out clean\nAs again it's been around for Twenty years and it was an attempt to\nHelp bring some order to the election system here in the state to various lawsuits were filed in the past to do away with matching funds which were successful so what's left is a a body that uh\nYou know regulates or those who running with the cleanup elections funds that are collected through fines et cetera and make sure that you're abiding by the laws and their rules et cetera now that\nIt's a nonpartisan commission and it's not already the clean elections commission is just stay organization that hands out money\nRight an appointed by a lawmaker shot at the leadership of the legislature GOP and dams\nOkay so so prompt thrill sex now that we've got some sort of an idea of what clean auctions as what is prompt three oh six due to clean election candidates here\nOkay it would appoint would create a oversight body first of all time and that the body would be in line with a oversight more stringent than what is in there and now a\nBecause there is technically an oversight body I mean the between elections commission is eight oversight\nBody that is correct but this new body would come in and would be a lot more strict and it would be something known as the governor's regulatory review council oh okay now uh they ... six people say that\nIt's a has unfettered control it doesn't have the same regulations that state agencies Avon or it can throw people off the ballot and it's just too powerful you know can they want that to rain then it would also keep a\nClean elections from filtering money to political parties and packs and that kind of thing and they want that added\nTo the election and it was a a voluntary system public financing for candidates\nAnd sing for candidates in state wide and legislative office is now candidates who get significant money of qualifying donations agree not to take outside cash and are entitled to a set sum of money for clean\nWho's a local player here at wide receiver one down the middle of the field and your phone the ball\nFor your keys combined on that play five yard touchdown of\nCourse and you know honestly it was a good sign\nIt was a court response to actually getting down on the load against go forty niners you allow them to school for years and suddenly you have a southern sick leave because the forty niners miss that at some point so to me it was um it was according to answer for jobs rules of the older completed what\nPasses\nWasn't exactly so we're talking to you Ron wool the cardinals radio analyst and co hosts of the dog and will show he\nHe's usually in here with us on a football fried out as you can tell he's on the phone and emergency sons news conference that he is going down to you that you can imagine they're going to be all over at Ninety eight seven FM Arizona sports station as well as right here at Katy are\nBut but wolf I'm very genuine and an authentic about sharing\nThe situation you've been in as an NFL player and you found yourself in a very similar situation as to the current\nCardinals team struggling to get that first when from the perspective that you have playing the game what have you seen in the cardinals team during that when is it something that leads you to believe they are on track\nDoes it is it something that leads you to believe you know fires ... underneath them or is it they're still struggling to kind of connect some of those very important dots\nNo I Do believe that to the defense of started their trend in a very good direction right now no listen they gave up a lot of yards against the San Francisco forty niners and they have a backup quarterback and CJ about four hundred and forty seven total yards\nBut you know what they did they kept the forty niners for the most part off the scoreboard and when I say that yeah they allowed Eighteen points against them but when you look at those other cargo ... all these are given up so far this season gas where they are in terms of scoring the science\nOr number ... overall in the lake and points allowed or wherever it almost in the top ten any time of doing anything in the top gun especially when it has to do with points\nEagle point school reports allowed\nSo the dog if they have done that that's why they're trying to well they only gave up sixteen points against the Chicago Bears they lost that they gave up ... points against the Seattle Seahawks lost that\nThat ... or it's against the forty niners what I'm saying is the sense that started the trend in the like the ... ... for\n... those are not all votes leader now play starts at ... ... what's special needs but the one area you see them and ...\nThat's with the pilots or something I don't know if there's a bigger effort that's more of the points along\nWell quickly Ron as you wrap it up again Ron willfully here you are going to jump on a plane here in a little bit you're flying to Minnesota deploying the Vikings um this Viking theme and it's been a little bit up and down don't get me wrong but you you know hurting ally is with him I said but it's different competition and the niners\nYeah no doubt about it first of all you're talking about her cousins and the Minnesota Vikings the number forty overall passing off and some of the national football league and I'll listen they haven't been able to go on the ball to save their lives but they can throw a ball that is the one thing they're doing very very well\nUsing play action number forty overall in the way guys when your top\nFive in major metrics like passing yards per day you're getting something done and they've got three great wide receivers out I'm feeling may be the best wide receiver believed that nobody talks about they've got stuff on their eggs a speed store that's got maybe the best\nMove us take off move I have seen in the NFL guy that is a big way receiver down the field they have ... role as well they have tile Rudolph Atari them this office is not about one in the fall because they don't do it well\nBut it's about passing the bone that's where they itself with for causes of course\nWho signed that huge gone for us\nFor not being franchised

D do three of them get some perspective Bruce St James ...\nNew movie opening up to de\n... is I think fair to say highly anticipated an the movie that\nI Am both already seen I finally got him with a commercial moving the movie is called first man it is the story of the first man to walk on the moon one Neil Armstrong and joining us in Studio right now is the director of that film Demian ... and you'll Armstrong son mark the vehicle not to say\nWe need to be made the male down here and you know male of them\nEvery once in a great way to like you to clamp\nDown on the way\nWhile a list of the movie fantastic let's just get that out of the way and and one of the things I Want to start with with you Damien on on making a film like this\nI actually went back after I saw this because I'm not old enough nor are you to remember man walking on on the moon I have no recollection of other than a grainy black and white things I've seen in the news what Beck and watched a documentary\nFilmmaker how do you tell the story tell a Hollywood Story of new Armstrong but still stay really close to what actually a real life event that hundreds of millions of people don't billions of people are on the planet watched with their own eyes like is that a tough balance\n[noise] uh it is but uh I think what what really helped in what inspired me to make this movie in the first place was actually how much behind that event and the years leading up to that event was not known how much of people just don't know about uh the private life of Neal and his wife Janet and their kids that that family story\nOr the missions that led up to Apollo eleven uh some of which ah we're we're\nFailed or near failed missions the losses the tragedies you know the mishaps um you know the the road to that famous success story was literally littered with failure and I think it actually is even more inspiring to look at it from that perspective the human perspective and look at the human toll\nSo uh so I guess you know in that case in and all the cases you know er visits is throughout the movie um [noise] the it was definitely a case of truth beating fiction turn I found it really uh the reality is even more astonishing than I think anything you could make\nWell I I Would I Would tell people this movie is less about space and more about a man well\nI mean not for me it's about the you know first man and you think about the first mission to the moon but there's also the family the aspect that which was really endearing to me and\nSo that's why I Want to ask questions now are marked Armstrong son of Neil Armstrong joining us right now on the program\nAnd mark there was a moment in the movie um it was the night your dad was leaving and Lena leaving to go well he should go to go to the moon and and he sat down with you and your brother it it sounds like you know the\nThe little\nWhile we're not sure we're going to get on to them on\nA lot of things have to go right before that happens\nWe have a real confidence in the mission and are\nWe have every intention of coming back\nBut you might not\nMark you or six years old at that time take us our kitchen table what number from that\n... yeah well I'm ... my brother and I told the story to to Damien an end to Josh a screenwriter so the story that that seemed came from us [noise] um\nAnd that's really the way it happened it you know dad said what Ryan said in a almost exactly to rich recollection he was twelve member little little older than I Do um but uh you know everywhere are just\nSort of he said are you know do you have any questions and I I Know that we asked them by ... and I don't remember exactly what they were but the amazing thing is I left at ... ... both left that room the dining room that night\nNot being worried you know thinking okay it's going to be fine we'll see him when he gets home [noise]\nUm you know um and we ... we had didn't have nightmares and those things but\nBut in retrospect knowing how mom must have felt you know I it's just amazing to me that that she held yeah withheld those fears from us yeah you know she she didn't let on that she was terrified and how and why and how dangerous it was a\nDidn't she may using woman I have so much respect and I watch this and and just\nI watch this and and just as a mom as a life as a woman and a strong\nAnd and Claritin is just such
