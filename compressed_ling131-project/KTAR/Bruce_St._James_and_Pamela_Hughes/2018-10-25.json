Ga or news on Ninety two three of them Bruce St James and analysts use\nOur number one number mind [noise]\nWe're number one in a category that I don't know of anyone\nThat's excited about one in this category battle as usual sadly what we talk about the things we're at the top of the list are not lists you want to be the top of congratulations Phoenix we are a number one in the country\nOn the list of most for unwanted political all my land\nWhile we were in harm's way in uniform here's some cinema was protesting us any pink two two and denigrating our service\nAnd if you don't wake up in the morning and things like this Republican ... guy get my kids\nYou've heard All right you know I mean you you got the the the things in the mail right I mean there was a reason I don't get the mail\nYou've seen them on television I'll probably even getting some text message as oh ... well yes Arizona we have become more competitive politically\nWhich means a lot more political advertising and we have now talk the left\nThe number of political ads on broadcast TV\nLet me put it this way if you think it's more than usual be you're right you're right yeah and if you and if you think ... and\nHere's why we have the dollar figures the candidates themselves\nHave raised a lot of money and then whatever they've raised you pretty much can double from these outside groups so when you raise\nA lot of money that means you've got a lot of money to advertise because advertising takes a lot of money and so when we got our sales department when we have a Senate race like we do right now between Republican more comic Sally and Democrat ... cinema\nAnd it has become as competitive as it is where the who's going to win\n... cinema and it has become as competitive as it\nIs where the who's going to win\nIs like one day at a toss up right now that I'm about one\nMinute ad and one day and the quality by one percent right so there's a lot of money being raised and poured into this campaign just how much\nAre we in a five day period seven million dollars so I mean this thing will probably ... records or anything but probably sixty million\nSixty dollars that's Mike Noble him saying that the Senate race in Arizona cinema mix Sally\nSixty\nMillion dollars and a lot of political advertising it's about even by the way I mean you can go I Know we're talking about ... million here or there I realize it's a million\nBut the candidates themselves a raise twenty seven twenty eight million dollars himself pretty even and then these outside groups have doubled that spending again pretty even on it so you're hearing\n'em you are hearing seeing getting in the mail a hell of a lot of stuff because there's a lot of money out there trying to influence your vote\nOkay it's not just in the mail it's not just on the radio and it's not just on the television where do a lot of us live\nNowadays on our phone devices our phone yeah on our phones so what we're having right now is more and more campaigns more and more a political parties that are calling you via robo call\nThe robocalls yeah but but but Pamela I have my name on that do not call list why the hell am I getting these robo calls you can still get robo calls because\nYou won't have a room and you're like what is not smell yeah they're they're being investigated right now for potentially targeting teens kind of

jewel lab is now valued at Fifteen billion dollars one of the world's largest fast growing startups it is bigger ... like several times faster than the start ups of\nFacebook snap whether okay so what you see now our companies are trying to get on the band Oregon and not just other nicotine companies or help you quit smoking companies what I told you and if there are now companies out there right now\nThat are well this company's health companies\nUsing vaping as a\nHealth tool that okay Toni light a men's room\nAnd it's really strange for me is somebody who is in to the health and wellness around\nTo see\nSomething that looks like smoke coming out of someone's mouth in a well known this ad yeah so particularly there's one that's called ... it's a citrus flavored vitamin B. twelve missed\nAll right okay and so you could get vitamin delivery through your electronic cigarette that's what they're claiming and what we got better than taking like a multi vitamin D up like a hell of a lot more trouble to go [laughter] it is\nAnd it's a heck of a lot more expensive as well as very little scientific backing or credibility on them\nNow you say that but I think sadly in and in the world of wellness or or in the world of of some of these other um uh businesses out there that\nThe health claims are not backed up by any studies but that doesn't stop Americans from spending billions on them\nBut the technology is so new whether it's nicotine whether it's just a little bit of cotton candy juice whether it's CBD or whether it's vitamin vague ups there's very little information it's not clear if these of apes\nAre helpful or harmful I mean back in the day I'm told I wasn't around during that cigarettes were promoted as healthy\nAs either but I remember was it like it was like oh you could lose weight like it was a weight loss thing you take up smoking and that and that smoking had no negative health benefits I certainly know that was the pitch\nAnd that was the pitch by the cigarette companies and it turned out later that they knew that was completely false and that's why they got sued and lost billions\nRight so I I think that right now with vaping it is still\nAnd that's why they got sued and lost billions\nRight so I I think that right now with vaping it is still so new yes I Know that ... was created in two thousand seven but that's only eleven years and it wasn't as big it took\nA little while to catch on so well I Know that beeping has helped some people quit smoking or has wean them off of cigarettes in general\nThe idea of putting vitamins into it and even if your body is able to process vitamins via vape is still\nSketchy science at ...
