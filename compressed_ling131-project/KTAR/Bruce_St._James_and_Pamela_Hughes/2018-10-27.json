two dozen innovations and the pain industry and a\nLot of them um uh\nHave to do primarily with um um masking materials and tapes as you've mentioned um some of the uh talking a and some of those kinds of products and things have evolved and so they are they're making a lot of changes every year and it's hard to keep up with a no what's good and what's not that's sure\nWe'll start with

talking paint products for making your job easier let's talk about actually getting to the pain now I don't know why they make buckets they're so hard to poor paint out of you get your one gallon can\nAnd you pour it into your tray or whatever you know a container you're using it puts a smaller bucket for touch up on the corner there is no way\nThat I have found to tilt it back and you don't have a little bit of paint left in Iran that you've got to wipe out before you seal it tight\nRunning down the side of the can send the ... in the trade in the seat trade for the widow\nWe've got

ring a painter on the edge reading [laughter]\nWell those are you know those those types that they've made a now for the gallon cans with the poor spouts and that got the lid on him that uh you know you can uh clothes and and you can actually just\nLeave it that way overnight and come back to the next day um the whole thing is just basically keeping the air from the from the liquid paint so they're great ah that's that's been one of the things that they've come out with you know in the last ten years has been a tremendous help in a practical way for the pain for sure\nThe Portland are great and the first time I use on a couple of years ago I was another thing I thought why didn't I think this is just to say not to think up and another one or the paint can buckets to handicap\nThat someone finally thought you know I'm going to put a magnet and this can so that the pain care can put his brush\nKeep it out of the paint but in the bucket so he can set it down and get a drink water take a phone call whatever the case that was a brilliant yeah absolutely brilliant\nAnd a tremendous help is one of the again it's one of those practical things the the industry it more and more is trying to\nCome up with a you know some good practical innovations for for the user so they're doing some things with her or do not mix with the with the tools themselves are doing some practical things as you've mentioned with the way that you a whole brushes and rollers and the containers that you're using\nUm I like the little uh\nA court size a paint containers that they have now that they sell the plastic liners for because you know it's an easy clean up you throw it away and\nAnd you don't have any time or or any labor and cleaning that are evil liners guy for trades and buckets ah well ah on the pro side we were always working out of five gallon buckets um\nBut uh we do have you know smaller jobs or or or uh things that don't require a lot of volume and paint we do use a sin trays and uh we do use some smaller containers\n'em to ah just kind of fit whatever the job is you're doing they sell liners for those paint trays against fantastic innovation because you just throw 'em away they're they're very cheap you buy 'em by the dozen down at a hardware store\nAnd those liners do create an additional waste but if you look at it you're all the water you're saving and then you're not washing paint into the landscape her down the drain the paint dry to the plastic where it's going to the landfill anyway so it's a better way to dispose of absolutely\nAbsolutely so yeah you do have uh you you do have a little plastic waste in that respect\nUm I wouldn't be surprised with ... with the ... some of the some of the innovations in technologies that they're coming up with that sometime in the next six to ten years that those liners are actually made out of recycle biodegradable\nA products because that's the whole industry and I really just a manufacturing on a whole is moving in that direction\nCorner rollers is there any that really worked at the ultimate tedious task of trying to get in the corner our tools me and this is this the only works if you're trying to do the same color on both walls\nAnd and they are they ... they sell some uh some sponge tools um that uh our four Ninety degree corners\nThey actually have some ... um that uh have radius is on them and some things like that for different ah application needs they do work good for for especially for the lay person homeowner just wanting to pay you know a few rooms at a time in their house and that kind of thing\nUm uh doing the same thing with a brush takes\nA skill set that um you know a usually only comes from being in the in the business so I think they are very handy and helpful or for homeowners they're they're pretty quick and easy to use the more that they are then doing with some of the sponge stuff\nYou're going to see some of that continue to a ball and some very good ways and practical ways\nDoes it create any kind of different look because we've got your sponge in the corner role then you've got your role as it does the rest of the wall I Know very few people are going to be sitting there looking at the corner wall to see if they could different type of\nApplication now yeah yeah but you can't see your brush stroke in your role strobe ... assistance or you don't see a\nGo staying is what we call it of where you've done something with something like a sponge or brushing versus the roller so as a rule what you do is is is you want to do that that's called your trim worker you're cut in work first and then you want to ...\nVersus the roller so his rule what you do is is is you want to do that that's called your trim worker you're cut in work first and then you want to roll into those areas and get as close as you can\nAnd and that's usually how you'll achieve the best kind of consistent looking very an apparent that you've done something you know in a corner up at the top of a wall and extra ceiling or something like ...\nWhen you're in your full paint mode what tools do you have on you at all the time it\nKinda depends a little bit on what phase of the ... but as a rule you've got to put a knife on you've got to some tape you've always got to you know drop club with you were the prepping or whatnot just to keep your area queen but

Coyotes\nI'm pretty much it's a little bit more limited uh then you show in Williams apso or done other words they have the ... uh and I have an Android so I went to the Google Play store and I just started typing John Edwards\nOkay that's a great Lynch was this on iPhone or Android that wasn't enjoyed both of these have been injured okay yeah so you're the only two in the officers already and probably I think I don't know if I should have something like that three oh Gary Johnny Iran again [laughter]\nUm so uh you know go to the play store um I started typing and John Edwards and John Edwards into color apples what popped up right away on as you suggest in and out when you go to install it it does have a couple of permissions on like at once access to your photos on than your camera\nBut it uses that like the show any Williams at any point your camera at a color\nOr at a you know like we are saying that on a bloom perhaps you have a beautiful purple Bush outside and you really want that purple and you can point the camera at that Bush and it will pick up the different colors um so when you're in the app\nYou don't have to have a a log in or or any type of account to use the ... you can just log in and use it or open up and use it right away you do have the option to create an account with John Edwards\nAnd and I I mean I didn't go that far as far as you know making an account and everything um but\nAh you open it up and you have the option to either take a photo or browse your photos to say you went to Sedona last weekend and you just love the beautiful red of the rocks and you want to duplicate that color you can upload that existing photos to the lab and then select what part\nOf the the picture the color that you actually watch\nAnd see this is something that could solve Rosie's first question that he got stumped on when he started the radio broadcast Thirty years ago was the homeowner wanted the color of paint that match yesterday sunset\nYeah so if you had a picture of yesterday's sunset upload it and you can grab that that the uniforms\nThat match yesterday sunset [laughter]\nYeah so if you had a picture of yesterday's sunset upload it and you can grab that and that the uniform orange paint that you wanted\nOr and with Instagram I'm sure you could have jumped on there and found a picture of yesterday's sunset or local sources uploaded and your your phone selection out and then there was a third out that we looked at yeah the ...\nWas um PG and the only uh issues that we first came up with for the ap itself to use it unlike Sherman Williams and Donna Edwards you actually need a outside piece of hardware they call it the Knicks sensor\nAnd it's just the little um maybe about an inch inch and a half high but maybe an inch wide and you would you do as you said it down onto a color swatch and it's got a little hole in the bottom and then senses the color and using the P. T. G. at which you connect to this this device Bluetooth\nIt will then upload all that information color number shade the name\nAnd that's how the P. P. G. app works they do however have a function on their browser so you go to a PG dot com [noise] uh I think it works in any browser I use chrome and you can upload a photo\nAnd so I think I took a photo of the the conference room and it it ... you're supposed to select surfaces like walls the mantle you know and recognized tables and chairs things you're obviously not going to be painting\nAnd for the most part it did a good job and you know you you lose out on the color match feature because unless you know you have to somehow to enlist you have the Knicks to scan it you know you go to the browser\nSort of sort of tough luck in that regard but you can if you have an idea of the color you can at least go and still visualize it\nAnd this color nix is that correct color mix it just next and I accept the call it the Knicks color censor it when you put it on a surface it's supposed to look at that surface and then give you the closest match book ... if you're trying to match that one right [noise]\nSo that's for color matching it does have the function were you know you could take all these different colors and put it over your surface so you can see what different colors you're trying to trying to change the color right yeah you can\nAnd I mean for the most part it works well you sweat the wall you left the color and it'll you know visualize that for you that this could be because I took a bad photo but there were a few times where it was mistaking things were not able surfaces as the wall\nAnd so the picture you would get is just wouldn't make no sense you just have to refresh it and\nSo I I Will say it could have been just a bad photo on my end I'll have to go out again\nBetween all three of these did we have a of an agreed favorite or it's all closely enough minus the the Knicks color match future\nYeah I think the Sherman Williams is our number one done Edwards very closely following it showing lines because you have that option to kind of use live view and you have a couple of other you know ... of what you can do what the paint there so\nUm that one was definitely first followed by Donna Edwards um you know just for the fact that it was really good at picking up the colors and an even time auto selected different colors so you didn't have to do too much messing around on the screen and you know you can save and favorites and all that stuff so\nDefinitely both very user friendly um you can open 'em right up use them you know no problem there's not a big learning curve or anything to him\nGoing back to Android or a apple app which ones are which you know\nI'm so we both have a Andrei ... all the apps that we tested when you you can download them not to the play store on Android um we didn't test them on an iPhone I Would imagine that they weren't just the same though\nI'm checking my app store right now\nJust checking out getting fatter [laughter]\nAh one was colors now ...\nAnd which one of those colors that that was the true religion Williams yeah or just last week was discussing that yeah so there there's ribs right their color snap for William's on iPhone and the other one was what was done you ... ... to color

bigger or whatever I mean I see in these are loaded up sequoias and Toyota's it doesn't matter of eighty jeez yeah it's it's ah\nIt's ridiculous it used to be I mean that's more than a lot of houses and in in certain areas of the of the\nOf the country so I'm thinking about this eighty four months I mean that's that's really signing up for a for for the big time well and you\nThat's a long time and you don't want to burn that sucker out before your payment books burned up you know what I mean and that's and then it happens though that's the thing right oh yeah people come to me they need to major repair they still get it they know they got sick payment bookstore at home I got a long way to go on that sucker\nYou know and so you know for me when I think of this topic because you you I was your rain over your shoulder there that fifty four percent of the cars that are used or finance yeah some people are buying new cars finance and those new cars is eighty percent of the new car sold or finance Ninety percent of the car so\nNo I don't have a real new car we got two thousand and two thousand six and a five ... that had a car payment and years and boy it feels\nNice not not to have one of course you're going to have had them before but but to be out for the weight of a car payment is one thing but\nBut you know we've got to we're going to sign up for that you got to think about the way you're going to take care of that car we've talked in the past about ... ... is if you're out shopping for a new car this morning\nReally think about what you're doing it in the cost of that and the cost of the financing and don't forget about the sales tax and all that stuff that goes in and you know what I'm simply would probably get a uh\nWe need to have probably come in under a disguise voice but a car salesman to teach us the tricks about oh yeah not buying a car and payments for example you know you still got to buy off what the car costs now how much the monthly payment is yeah uh well that's that's one trapped trapped tools\nThey always yeah what kind of payment you looking for you know tell them three fifty they're thinking of all that there is they can do three fifty they can certainly do four twenty five four twenty five four Seventy five while they're just other looks good\nAre we are helping you with your car whether you're looking to buy one whether you're looking to get rid of the one looking to fix one don't know what the heck you want to give us a call ... so to to seven seven five eight to seven well now let's go with Jim in Gilbert he's got a two thousand Thirteen Ford F. one fifty how can we help you Jim you're on bumper to bumper radio\nYeah Hi good morning guys appreciate your help yeah I got a uh like I said at twenty thirty forty fifty and the oil light a keeps coming on and off a check the oil oil levels great I checked the oil filter in oil filters tight and it's like when we stopped\nAt a light or a stop sign it'll come on and off say low pressure and a and I don't know just a bad search or\nDid you check or did you you did check the oil level\nYeah okay yeah and it happened right after I change the oil I change your lifestyle but you know um but I made sure the oil filters on there and then they're all levels perfect\nWell is there any ...\nThat the oil filter is on there and then they're all levels perfect\nWell is there any noise associated with that light comes on and you know you ...\n... I think Jim what you need to do in this happens even the best repair shops at times is get a underneath back underneath the truck or wherever the oil from Iran is on that and make sure you didn't somehow pinch damage or disrupt\nThe well precious which were the wire going that would be my first look Dave and then after that I think we need to do a a mechanical oil pressure test and verify what the what the pressure actually is\n[noise] yeah now you're asking about noise 'cause when when you are lacking oil pressure you going to get some sort of low and knock out of the motor it's going to it's going to make some noise in a you know so but the one thing you said you know when he slowed down you know one engines are low on oil you ... you come slowing down to stop all that oil slices the front of the oil pan\nFor the way you drive your material stop stop but you know so I wondered if\nThat but he said the oil levels right on the money so you know maybe we truly don't have an oil pressure on the other thing too sometimes ... you come to a stop maybe the engine idols way down and now the oil prices gonna read though because the engines idling so low\nYeah that's what I was thinking of low speed thing but it's hard to tell but I think Jim maybe he will calls and give us an update next week or or send us a note and let us know what happens but I'd be interested in the thing that got me it's just right after you to do a change makes me think we might have ... go ahead or an error on there yeah for sure things on the call Jim\nSix though to to seven seven five eight to seven let's go with it and good year he's got a two thousand and two Hyundai Sonata how can we help you had your own bumper to bumper radio\nYeah I've got one of the air temperature gets down in the sixties or get a kick up going to get so automatic transmission going from secular third there at as it gets colder and the winter it goes from ... to us from like it won't even doesn't want to keep going but it does\nThe transmission is fine when the cars or running for transmission works great but that cold the cold is just as a teacher too\nYou know one one of the things that need commonly comes up is that in the winter time as the temperatures change to the transmission food changes\nYou know so a cause it expands and contracts with temperature and it's cooler out now and anywhere where there's it's a hydraulic machine and anywhere where maybe there was a seal this week and\nIt's really going to ... it's not going to work as well in the wintertime so we see a lot of that kind of morning sickness happen come wintertime when a transmission starting to get old and show at the age I'm not saying that's what's going on usually a Hyundai is pretty quick to throw a gear ratio where I'm going to a lip mode if it is actually slipping but there may start to be something going on there is something you want to get diagnosed how\nWould you do that day would is this something that you might just let warm up in the garage for three or four minutes and see if that affected it gives some heat and the food or or just to to try and help with a diagnostic tool before bringing in or not really\nYou could try you you could try that I I Would drive in the ... you know see what's happening specifically one shift or another shift you know see what's happening\nBut I I'm surprised that it's not turn the check engine light on a and putting it into a fail safe mode so you know and sometimes I mean we hear people describe stuff to us all the time and were immediately thinking of transmission problem that we had in the bay and the engines ... right you know so if an Indian not running well the transmission can't work well so there's other things that affect the transmission heavily\nWell that's why you got to be careful going into some shops and saying I Need a transmission yeah because you might get a transmission they go hey out by the way you needed to know to another fix that problem they want us but the transmission or or the ... center or something like that it's not uncommon\nWell that's what I say almost be built in describing symptoms not what you think it is you know here's what I feel here's what I experience and then let them do what they you know what they do but if you go in you can actually lead them down the wrong path and they start chasing the problem is not even really they're\nSo good ... good luck with that ad let's go with the Jeremy and good you're also he's uh gonna leasing question how can we help you Germany Ron bumper to bumper radio\nYeah Hi I just wanted to ah get your thoughts on [noise] I mean I've heard lots where at least not such a great idea I've read a little bit about it and maybe I'm going through a midlife crisis and just want that\nMirror by our vet convertible because that's where I have well maybe not that I'm looking at kind of considering\nA Toyota Highlander got to\nGet all Camry right now two thousand and I mentioned that earlier but it's a smells like gas tax I turn it off and\nI said I might have got exhausted but I don't think I Do anyway I didn't mention that early but I'm really Canada's beside trying to do all these are not the pros sound pretty good because I Know are pretty bad but yeah I'm kinda tired of\nHaving car problems and it just sounds like a just a pleasant thing to have a a new car\nAnd yeah\nHaving car problems and it just sounds like a just a pleasant thing to have a a new car and yeah\nAnd then well I think the one thing with the ... I've always heard bad things about ... I mean I grew up my dad was always anti borrow money you can afford to pay cash for it you can't afford it that kind of thing you don't live just never borrow money that's that's always been engrained in me\n... I ... you just got applied math too you gotta put a spreadsheet ... um\nYou know what people don't understand I think is the biggest thing ... it is like just like by the car payment this is the amount that you pay every month there's there's there's some down payment but it's not as heavy as what you would normally have a down payment and and but you walk away from the car\nAt the end of the deal after those thirty six months or whatever it is you just walk away but you still have to negotiate the price of the car ... that's where they really make a at least up their ears the lease and it might just be based on the sticker price\nSomebody you're still buying that car you're just renting it from them so the lower the acquisition cost is for Joe blow financing or whether it's Toyota Motor credit which by the way is different than toy car sales and manufacturing where that they're different entities somebody has to make an exchange of money\nSo if that highland or that you're looking at forty grand on the sticker and that's what all the release numbers are based on you can talk them down to negotiate that down there maybe thirty eight that is going to affect the lease\nBut the other thing where I see people get hurt on the lease is is the mileage they under anticipate what their mileage is going to what they're going to use the mileage and that's a really good way to take a bath on one of those leases and then the other thing that people do they get to lease\nThey think they don't need to take care of the car would you do I would ... treated at least ... different than I Would in owned a car but on the turning\nAnd they go if you go if you didn't put the right tires on it ma'am they mail you got that being in the door nailed ya so there's a lot of other things that go along with\nThat so I it's just you got to get a calculator and get some sheets out start running numbers and run them for not three years running for five and six and seven years\nLooking at the resale value of the car when you're done with that there's a whole lot that goes into it or you could be married to rent a car for the rest of your life\nYeah and right and then they get it in your may be okay with that as you got to run cars you know some people don't want to buy a house they just rent a house and I live in a ... that's the way they want to do it that's the way our replies your life perfect for sure well we've got a you know more open phones at six so to to seven seven five eight to seven\nWhen we come back we've got Wayne Bob Colette are using the ... and Dave on bumper to bumper rated we'll be right back [noise]\n\nThere is nothing more important than family high ... recruits auto repair I brought my nephew and general manager Jeff ... to help spread the word\nThanks pops up the more things change the more they stay the same Kurt family owned and operated ESE master tax and family ethics ... is a perfect the better Business Bureau record for over Thirty years\nJust east of ice Seventeen at twenty Second Avenue in belle ... online has my car hurts dot com gas or diesel foreign or domestic if your car hurts pick up the ...\nSome say one of the worst sounds you can hear is a car crash\nAnd yes and all the stress that goes with that can be worse the accident stressful enough\nThe repair process doesn't have to be Hi this is Kevin Dave ... men\nWere the collusion team at bumper to bumper radio individually we own campus body salon I Seventeen collision and first class auto body together we're an unbeatable team working for you not the insurance company to get your job done right check us out at bumper to bumper radio dot\nCom here's one carry from Tempe had to say about her experience and with good works auto repair\nAs soon as you realize I Need to get some work done in my car\nI'm sure that's not a case you that you're about to get chicken ...

you can use is really\nGood at it as a ton of it for ... and I got to give a shout out to to Michael Moore who's your your business partner correct\nYes into his partners now for eight years\nYes and so we took him to a ... another friend about it as we saw a lot of house with a voted him to too much and we went to two over to basic country club and how much over there\nAnd um it was it was just kind of like hey you know a ... where do you see the market go in and this was a three probably three years ago with a three three three and a half years ago\nAnd he said well I think that ah we're gonna go we're like a hundred and I think was a hundred and Fifteen bucks a square foot every square foot you you probably know who you're better than that I Would have used to I think we can go to a hundred and thirty five bucks a a a square foot within the year\nAnd I'm like wow I'm okay and I bought like three or four houses are the best of both the ... and the ... a month just because of of what he said and ... uh it went up the went up to what thirty five for over the next\nYear and a half and at the I've made a ton of money on those for those houses so I got up I I forgot that if you see a ... thank you for me so well and Michael\nOr is a mathematician by trade so he started the carpet report in two thousand four when he was investing he used it for himself and then um it kind of kept growing from there and he started sharing it with friends and and and the less approached and so he did it for the last numbers and now we're independent\nReally what what you do write he was a\nA an see recruited him on and two thousand twelve it at all public record he didn't use I'm a less data for that and created a whole another public record side and that's where I actually do a lot of our fix and flip a analysis off of that database\nDirector David where are you seeing a lot more fix and flip through the ... they're going on right now or less what what are you seeing there\nWell I if I Would say for normal fix and flip investors your regular individuals' we are only up about two point seven percent over last year in those I'm very moderate increase but we have seen a huge increase in um what they call the I buy are type a\nI don't know that I Want to call them fix and flip side just call them flips God I don't know that they do a lot of fixing a were just putting lipstick on a pig sort of\nAll let you [laughter] see more of them than I Do but um I buyers will\nBe for example open door and offer pad and now is the low uh these corporations that say we'll give you a you know an on line offer for your home you got to go in and um we have seen a significant increase those types of sales have doubled last year and they're now making up thirty seven percent of all of our flipping flip data\nYeah no it's a they bought a lot of money into the into this ... this real mid ... and that's what makes us a little different than that but as we go out we actually go out to the house and a A N G it's about ... over the Internet and whatever we go up there will school actually\nThat's what makes us a little different than them as we go out we actually go out to the house and and uh and and she is about over the Internet and whenever we go out there and will ... will actually look at the house give you a number right there the spot and there won't be any surprises at the end they won't we won't say okay we're going to do an inspection the kitchen for another ten grand or this or the other\nIs just the number that we give you that's it that's where you'll take home maybe it was a personal experience it's a personal experience exactly if you need\nA something that you know you need to stay in the house of extra couple of days if you need ... whatever it may be a week of actually customize it to whatever it\nIs you know a lot of people you know the they talk to you Doug and they say well my gosh does your competition you know a lot of people with cranes you just mentioned the competition but in your case you say you're really happy that they're hearing the market you know ... ...\nIt really has um because it's made it more I'm more mainstream you know it it's not like oh my gosh you know I Can't believe you sold it for that it's like no this is this is what people need to there's a there's an obvious walked in the marketplace for it\nYou know you just said you know to make it up a ... an American seven percent ... percent of flips and how many how many of the actual buys a MLS as a whole is like seven percent you set of\nWell they don't generally buy off the in the last they buy directly from seller so they're more along the lines of for sale by owners they're technically ... percent by owner Dutch actions that the vast majority of them are and I believe the last number I looked they were they were buying about\nTwo hundred and thirty ... on properties a month and just open door by themselves they don't have any thoughts about what we do [laughter]\nI I mean it's a and I don't have the exact number in front of me that I Will hear in just a second yeah the last number I have is I actually almost three hundred they did\nIn a gym they and they closed on on two hundred and Ninety eight\nNaturally difficult to have a personal experience with two hundred Ninety eight other sellers same time\nSure you know listen they have a lot of money they bought and a lot of money from from Wall street and and uh you know they they show that there's a market place for it and\nAnd that's really helped me out because if you go to ... and tried the other experience of and try us there's a reasonable were buying a bunch of houses ourselves and most people have gone out and gotten offers from all three ... and um you their Budweiser work craft beer ... that's a that's a perfect analogy right there absolutely a perfect analogy\nOf this other couple of things in order to get so\nTo me that I get I get this I'm sure you do all the time everyone wants to do with the the crystal ball what does the future look like we're ... where do you see this uh this is going into next year ... people it's like oh we're going to crash we're going to go up we're going to continue to go up or where where do you see uh where do you see the school year the next uh in the next year\nWell um what I Believe is going to happen now I just want to\nPreface this by saying the crime for her part we don't do long term projection I kind of consider asked if you're driving along a curvy road at night with no headlights

man\nGoing to be around the whole time bad sorry about that [laughter] I Know you're a dog in the on the last segment\nAren't candid ... yelling but you know what we said the best ... it's not like that\nUh you are you really see the ... from the ... project port and died all the different things that she's been singing and yes we're still on the seller's market it it does seem to be slowing down a little bit hot but if you're a buyer uh you're going to want to be choosy and a lot of times when you go into I get a loan\nOr did they want to know where the houses what the exact address the ... and all that good stuff we've got we've got moving prices we've got moving rates you know give us a little bit of stability here\nBefore you get into that there was there I I Do want to mention the one thing she did say that was very very important if you are looking to buy a house now thinking\nAnd and you're waiting till later because you think the prices are going to come down it's not going to hang in there going to continue to go up so it's ... it's just not going to happen is there's not there's some big bubble has burst thing or a few minutes ago that's going to happen like that\nYou know it's it's all goes off the numbers it's yeah it's amazing how how important numbers are statistics are and and uh you know data is and that's what they put together at the crop for reporters all that data they're putting together as in and listen I mean they're they're professionals they know what they're doing\nUm and it says that it's going to continue to go up it's going to continue to appreciate so if you're waiting to buy sick of it is going to come down you're wrong\nThere and the rates are going to continue to grow up to yes rates are continuing to grow up ever so slightly I still don't think that you know a large jumping rates of anything that you know the that the country can or cannot sustain and and and take on yet but with the rates increasing and with and Being American\nAnything that you know the that the country can or cannot sustain and and and take on yet but with the rates increasing in with it being a very competitive market these days\nWe just found out about a new program and we have you know with us being with home bridge for\nYou know just a matter of a month now every day we're learning something new and something more fantastic that's coming out of the different programs different programs are programs that are ... just for every body or in one of them is well with the ... you know the competitive nature of the market right now in the interest rates rising\nLocking that right you don't even have to have a property how do you do that\nI Would you call in to us we get the application started we can go ahead and just just we do it on our side would\nYou say you get is approved based on income what would qualify for yeah and then you could lock in the rate does that cost you a lot of money to be able to do that or it\nCosts nothing absolutely nothing you can walk up to a hundred and twenty days which is for money right now people are finding houses within you know sixty days Ninety Days as long as you have a contract in place in the last thirty days of that lock you could still hold onto it better yet if rates happen to drop\nYou can actually take advantage of that lower rate at that time just because you lock in at let's say you know four point seven five and then rates yield a four and a half later on when you're not stuck with that four point seven five we want you to get the best right we want you to get the lowest possible so afraid to do decline you're going to be able to take advantage of that as well\nThat's a pretty good deal and there is so let me ask you this because I I'm always looking for the loophole I Know your way we're trying to get me here are so it's good for a hundred and twenty days let's say as let's say sixty Seventy five days later I put a contract down on the house Institute of
