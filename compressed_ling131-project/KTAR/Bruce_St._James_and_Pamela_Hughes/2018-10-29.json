called our air\nI bought my Arizona's new station gay DARE news\nArizona's news station KBA our news on Ninety two three of\nThem get some perspective Bruce St James ... obviously some pretty high profile criminal cases in just the last few days from what is\nThe number of mail bombs were up to you know Fifteen\nSome new ones were discussing yeah this morning they believe they found one in Atlanta headed for CNN the owners of the suspected male bomber is not speaking to authorities right now we don't know if there's more correct authorities are saying is they believe that means that there may be still more in the system\nAnd went out to Fifteen\nOkay then you obviously had the horrific murder inside of a Pittsburgh cynical um and one of the things they were paying attention to is that the charges may be the the law enforcement angle of this\nSo it was around this time on friday when you were joining us that we heard the department of justice list the charges against a Cesar ... that is down in Florida the suspected Mel bomber and here is attorney general Jeff Sessions lifting some of those charges\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former presidents and certain other persons\nWell Jeff sessions lifting some of those charges\nIllegal mailing of explosives threats against former president ... certain other person's threatening interstate communications and assaulting current and former federal officers\nOkay so that that's a reading of the charges we hear he faces fifty eight years in prison if convicted on all the charges et\nCetera but something was left out of there that left out of the lift the list of charges or something that I think a lot of people we hear the terminology used yet Mr ... was not charged with by the way nor do we\nBelieve that the\nPittsburgh shooter will be charged with terrorism domestic terrorism\nBut so many in in in the law enforcement community were referring to the mail bomb or as an act of domestic terrorism\nYou may have an act of domestic terrorism in the U.S legal code does have a definition for it yeah these do not rise to that level\nAnd you might what you're not domestic terrorism exactly\nHere is the thing I can I can read you the the definition of domestic terrorist acts meant to intimidate the civilian population or influence government policy to corrosion yeah Ogden time yeah here's the problem the first amendment of the United states supersedes us legal code\nAnd that a citizen committing these ... this was a let me put it this way or\nThe male bomber or the synagogue die if they were wearing an ISIS flag on their shirt if they were saying all ... told them to do it then you've got your terrorism you've got your domestic terrorism\nBut merely because they were inspired by words\nRight because they're saying that they're they're the property the ... the horse farm that their property is worth less because you can smell marijuana growing down the street\n[noise] well I mean now they're suing in federal court and that's important okay make that distinction from me why marijuana is legal in the state of Colorado yeah yeah marijuana\nIs illegal up according to federal law so there's a conflict\nAnd when there's a conflict like this what usually happens the Supreme Court comes into referee the conflict and so what you\nYou also is which is I said interesting and I'm not pleased with it the plaintiffs in this case are arguing\nRacketeering federal Rico statute this is the people the horse property yeah okay\nThey're using the Rico statute what this does rancho ... that was originally went to go after the mob where where ... was not just the crime they were committing it was the running basically running a criminal conspiracy\nThere arguing that the the lower Colorado grow house by Colorado law is a ongoing critical conspiracy why the mob wow and therefore the federal government should rule on their side and go after this criminal conspiracy happening next\nOkay if we are going to talking spheres easier you know this sounds like to me Bruce that there was some sort of like you know it was home like ambulance chasers but like like a pot chase or Yahoo hey there's a grow house over there\nHe do you guys ever smell pot on your property F cell join our law case 'cause it seems like they pulled something reaching for that is that while there seems to me but there are several\nOther similar cases that have been filed take a listen\nSimilar lawsuits have been filed in three other states where marijuana is currently legally you can guarantee they will be watching this case very very closely\nWell here's the thing so they're also using the Rico statute for this reason\nSo Rico allowed you to let's say you catch the guy the member of the mob who actually did the hit you know he off some guy you don't you're charged with murder you charge them under the Rico statute\nYou can drag the guy in the usa ordered him to do this guy was never there never pulled the trigger does it matter were charging you because we know you gave the order so with by using recounts the Rico statute in Colorado going after a legal grower\nThey want to go after everybody who's involved in the marijuana industry saying it's not just as growers smells really want to me\nLegal grower they want to go after everybody who's involved in the marijuana industry saying it's not just as growers smells really what I mean it's every one along the path who made it possible for this guy\nOr shall I say this is the key to me it doesn't it just it sounds\nOut rage yes oh it is\nIt's so like there's a bigger thing going on behind the ideal didn't want to marijuana is yeah I never want to die legalizing marijuana I'm sure you know what I ... if you told me that a a a a Marlboro was behind the lawsuit I wouldn't be\nSurprised me okay so there's a lot more officers there are no kidding you to shut down the you know what if you ever miss

I'm All right so you got this is that her house or your house I can but it's person says her brother living there\nCorrect okay if you didn't own the house she wouldn't go buy that house and call tax benefits and subsidizing brother a good plan\n\nYeah we're actually up to them down in the house she bought it for two ten probably worth about one Seventy one eighty\nOkay well we're probably hold it and break even do we can get it come on up in value what's your household income\nUh between the two of the about one between one eighty and two hundred\nAnd catch the question is what to pay off first or what\n[noise] yeah uh well I also have so when I purchased the house from we we bought the house that we live in now in two thousand and three and I had\nThe the money to put down on the house but I didn't I wasn't able to show income so the house was actually purchased to my father's name ... once I had developed the income to be able to get a loan or the mortgage and my name and before I was getting married I had purchased a home from my dad\nNow for me to have that mortgage and not a PM I\nAh there had to be a certain amount of equity which I didn't have enough cash at the time so my father essentially gifted\nMeans what Clinton\nThe question is do I pay back the uh the the money to my father because I'm\nPaying him that I'm saying and be sure\nYou have a second mortgage on your house to hear that you're going to stay on the house you know you're paying off ... absolutely and then you can also first mortgage and then hopefully by then that rental will come up to its ... worth at least what you owe on it and you can get rid of it and get rid of brother out of the house\nAnd then your debt frozen uh yeah yeah\nYeah I Would not only a rental property that I break even on do it's not my goal I'd sell that rental property as soon as brother could move if you weren't forty thousand dollars upside down but you're forty thousand dollars upside down so well let's wait on that market to recover a little bit because most real estate in the U.S has not recovered you're in a weird situation there that if it hasn't\nBut I'll give it a ... a year or two or whatever and was good it recovers wants to write a large check to get rid of it I'd rather I'd a hundred and thirty six dollar check than a what a forty thousand dollar checks all do that for a little while but this idea of buying property to subsidize relatives that we're losing money on and calling a tax write off this is not good with money but\nYou didn't set out to do that it's just where you ended up by marrying into it so when it comes up in value dump it in in the meantime pay off your second and pay off your first there we go think Kevin's with us in Denver Hi Kevin how are you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up things during my call a two part question\nHi Kevin how are you doing good how you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise] they they might call a two part question as I got out of the first part need help on the second part um\nMy dad came to me a couple of years ago and um he was getting ready to retire and wanted to take a or offered for me to take over a whole life insurance policy for um\nA guy looking to get rid of the ... before he retired mhm I Would like to get rid of it now knowing a little bit more about ... insurance [laughter] but he keeps telling me I Need to hang on to it mhm and bad so that when he retired\nOr excuse me when he says I have money to pay the taxes on ah the inheritance money that will be coming to me and\nSo how are just as a state [noise] uh I Would say close to a million\nThere's no taxes on his estate so\nThat nobody should on taxes I Know you don't have that ... there's no tax federal there is no federal or state tax on the states over a ... unless they're over five point for nine million this year\n\n[laughter] okay so everything like though all hit so he's he can I think he's converting must like this raw than throwing caves and all those things though\nIf it was a state is one million dollars there's no taxes on\nHow they any taxes on any of it\nNow you might pay a state probate tax but there's no federal estate taxes on in the state of one million dollars\nNot see we're okay there are\nOver five million dollars for the feds to get ... so so if he's got you know what he's doing he's territory in the back what the idiot whole life agent told him that sold in this\nYou need to keep their costs have state tax planning\nAnd and he's been hearing that since you were
