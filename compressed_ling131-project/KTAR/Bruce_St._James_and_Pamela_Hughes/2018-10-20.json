other guy\nThat's okay um I I'm a gardener I Do a lot of color stuff I talked to a lot of women that there are direct to me is what they want and what I've come to realize or believe is that women and men see colors differently for\nInstance especially the reds versus oranges and I was just curious if your guest just had the same experience\nWe will ask carrying that question she's joining us here right after the bottom of the hour news segment so your your observation is that if I see read a a color red or my wife Amanda would look at that and say no romey that's orange\n[noise] more likely you'll see something that is a dark orange\nAnd she'll say that's red and you'll go no it's orange and I've\nI've given up this argument because I always got to please the customer and but there's a all around Sally is a plant that's pretty common and it's a it's a bright orange or or a darker orange and I've had numerous where my customers telling me that thing is read I'm taking a bogus is red or a silly is orange but\nYou know I get them the color they want and and everybody's happy but I'm curious ... with other professionals if they've noticed the same thing\nAll right I don't know if we're going to be able to [noise]\nUh I'm not sure if our guest is has the what what is optical ... to ... the objects the optic genetic makeup of male versus female and how color is received to the brain\nBut ah we'll we'll find out here shortly as a we bring our guest on the conversation on our color selection topic when you go into a paint store it\nIs so easy to get overwhelmed you knew or when we did Landrieu's room a couple of weeks ago\n[laughter] a couple of weeks this was like a year and a half I think I'm\nI've noticed a little bit of wallpaper coming back that's something we hadn't seen in a long time and I saw more wallpaper selection come in but the the matching of wallpaper to paint a is a completely separate topic\nBut what's interesting about the wallpaper that you cannot do as pain is the different kind of patterns you can do and the adoption of layering different colors\nYou know this this creates a whole nother thought process I like the very clean blanket of one color on a pain but there's layering you can do for both finishing and different\nTexture appear you can take a smooth plaster and do a full finish and looked like you've got this expensive marble they were shipped in from Italy that you put into your\nUh on this round column as you walk into your front entryway there's just\nAn illusion of the right paint application from somebody to\nSpend a lot of time learning this technique so not only does one color on one wall come into a factor but are we going to layer it and that can create a very um [noise] a very affordable way to look like you've got an a very expensive finish\nAnd last year on the interior a very long time\nSo we've got an additional layer for full finishing but the the tools that comes into play we're not doing a lot of role paint that maybe your base but we're using a lot of ... techniques that change\nChanges our uh our skill level you've also got to be able to live with imperfection when you're doing that you can over design it all on a full finish\nAnd it's going to look so fake\nPut this in terms of artificial turf when it first came out it was so perfect it's so green so perfect it was so obvious it was fake it started to catch on when they developed imperfections into it to look like it is in its natural state and that's a very easy thing to do on\nA full finish when we're working on what was the perfect it so meticulously that when you're done and you step back you're like man that that is the biggest thing I've ever seen any amount of time it takes to do a full finish you the last thing you're going to want to do anybody wants to do is start over\nBut that's one great thing about paint you can start over\nYou the last thing you're going to want to do anybody wants to do is start over\nBut that's one great thing about paint you can start over get all white finish\nGo over the top let's get a clean slate it's it's not exactly any race or type solution but\nIt's a whitewash out to start over is is a reality so if this is something we're doing our self and it's a wall and a sitting area that it's okay to have a drop costs in front of for a couple of months while we finish it a perfect whatever technique or trying to finish\nYour you could do that and just live with the fact that this is\nThis is a creation this isn't just a balloon go job you're doing something you're creating something for your home and living space that you're going to say that look at it as crazy as it sounds stare\nAt and enjoy while you're just living in your home whether it's watching TV

well if you eat through monsoon season and your little nervous about your roof that you should call her friends over political roofing their rosy on how certified and family owned and operated for over twenty\nUh you get to see what's gonna happen I often find the clients\nDon't try colors in a proper manner they they float a small sample that they've bought up in the middle of a wall and it's just out of context doesn't really mean anything the color consultant does what I call walk around the color they show it behind the sofa next to the drapes\nDown next to the base sports that you can see Flora based sport and new color\nSometimes we need to block out of big busy bold red that's currently there so then we are trained that we put a piece of a large piece of paper white paper behind the color was showing that you can block out what's currently there and influencing that new color\nSo it it is tricky but we have a lot of tips and tricks that help walk you through this is our profession is is what we do every day we have so many people say wow I cannot believe\nI got to the end and this is great this is just what I was hoping for at the end of the appointment you typically will be speaking with your customer we prepare a shopping list a color list for them to to keep and the samples they get to keep but at the end you're talking to him and the samples are all laid out and you can tell on top of their\nBeautiful granite is sitting maybe four to five six colors and they are a beautiful palate and you can see just right even they're laying down on the countertop what a beautiful palate is going to work with their things\nIt's not about the ... what the color consultant thinks it's beautiful it's about what the client wants and what looks good on their clients' home and they're lighting\nAnd when we say client you'd think business you think professional ... some of these clients I mean when I painted it for landers room she picked the colors she's three [laughter]\nYeah your hands that it's sometimes it's a really great and when the client maybe picks a color that you know they're in the right color family\nBut like you were talking earlier about the gold you need to knock it down that's what we'll give the advice in its you know it's a gentle little just a poll\nBut like you were talking earlier about the gold do you need to knock it down that's what we'll give the advice and it's you know it's a gentle little just a poll did you think about uh you know toning down to this and then we'll give the reasons why everything's in contacts there's a reason for why in all of design and especially color\nSo when people are trying to select some color and it's sometimes random I'll say well you know why do you like that caller why do you want to put that color\nAnd they often don't have a good reason and they can if I'm showing him something else they can off often understand why that isn't a good color without saying yeah that's a terrible color\nSo it's a process and most people are are very open to it and very delighted at the end with what they have\nAnd when you see terrible color terrible color for this one particular ... could be the perfect one for another project another project uh-huh how many different color wheels do you have I'm not going to see how many colors total but that well you got like a fan\nYeah F. A. index so current our our latest ... has over Fifteen hundred colors in it it has historically correct interior colors and historically correct exterior colors so let's say if you're in Arcadia and you want to go historically correct we can help you by pulling out that palate\nUm we have other older ... that have you know colors but they constantly keep updating it adding new colors because trends how they'd go sell the current one we're working with you know it's about Fifteen hundred plus colors\nAnd in that ... you say historically correct so when we're mixing our paint when we pick a color you know the the mix or in the back he's like okay for this color need X amount of drops of this material X amount of drops of this material all mixed in here and shake it up and that gives us just finished color how\nFar how long do you keep that recipe for that color\n[noise] they have so sure Williams began in Eighteen sixty six they have all their recipes from forever so you know they have everything\nFate teen sixty six yeah it's a hundred and fifty two year old company so when we're talking historically correct we can be matching something from turn of the central\nYeah that's what I'm Talking they're beautiful to an end reinterpreted and use it in New ways they're beautiful as well so there are fun palate to look over and see how they're applied\nAnd with the new age and technology and the digital era\nWe can save those you can say those in his computer system so that somebody coming back to update their pain you know like all things time fades where's but if it's a or maybe we're getting ready for some company and we need some touch up\nAnd the paint can it's five years old under the kitchen sink\nIsn't paint quality that we want to apply during existing or existing while they can come back and you've got the records indicating exactly what color number that was in you can take the color number the paint mixture and they can say All right here's my recipe make a cordless paint\nCorrect so one of the cool things that we have at Sherman Williams is something called paint perks where you become a preferred customer of ours so every time you shop with us\nIt records in this paint perks what you've purchased what product you've purchased what sheen you've purchased\nSo that when you get in trouble like you said your start your pain of the same but it's been five or ... years and it's just old and you don't like it that consistency so you do need a new product you can go to your church show Williams and tell them you're preferred a main number phone number they look you up by and\nI dealt with the ups and knew\nOf the same color same products same sheen and you'll be able to touch up so it's a great service to be a member of our paint perks\nHis hard to stop a tree ... condition exist is located in a trailer I trade in both of those little point was quoted a loses divorce schedule service for any and all your HVAC whatever's little rings harsh conditions you could count on the relentless actually has proved to assemble harshest the regime of\nFreezing temperatures just special finance exist forty eight months or just you know it's up to ... thousand dollars to qualify you trace system subject you're credited approval for eligibility today the seals were stretches the trade in Africa\nMilitary assistance mission providing financial support to Arizona active duty military\nWe help ... six and below which is our lowest paid lists of service members we pay that bill directing make sure that that service members taking care of\nBy Margie bugs military assistance mission provides financial support and morality to our current Arizona active duty military personnel we qualify for that\nSerious assistance mission provides financial support and morality to our current Arizona active duty military personnel\nWe qualify for the Arizona working poor tax credit agency because we only serve Arizona ... am Asian ... dot\nOrg look up in the sky stampede Wyoming professional\nAthletes all toilets single bound stampede Wyoming doing business as Benjamin Franklin Wyoming hero rescue from circling the drain serving a ballet ready to buy one four hours a day every day and reliable and they'll do a great job the first time I got a two there\nIn the campaign money or you know eight once you Eighteen fifty five that's boring oh eight one two Eighteen fifty by von ...

I Am a need to go practice a little bit for tonight maybe get conditions for sure so I'm going to be hydrated some more\nAfter the show a for sure but had a jumpstart your car you know yeah yeah that's that's that's that's a nice piece of advice so uh you know and I think about don't do it because we are going to tell you how to do it but also tell you I'm not sure don't do it you know that's\nYou can go wrong it's one of those things where it's kind of like lighten the barbecue\nGrill you know you heard the grill on and you hear the gas hissing and you're like click click click and I set forth quickly like oh yeah you got out of time yeah you kind of back up a little bit your you get your head turned reaching out behind your back you're pushing the net or button and I am\nYes so if you're not sure what you're doing that's that's real number one\nBut you know Dave I even say well we're talking about how to do it but I I'd say even if you know what you're doing don't do it at times especially with jumper cables I mean we talked differently jumper cables jump boxes and then the little miniature battery packs that\nThat work quite well but I think part of the thing too is we need to avoid needed a jumpstart in the first place yeah we do in the modern car if you will they all time out you you leave the lights on for the most part are going to shut off the car will go to sleep like Seventeen minutes or or or something like that\nSo if you're taking care of your battery and and doing all that stuff you shouldn't have a problem occasionally you can leave a light on the door open the kid my kids you know when they're younger leave the dome light on in the very back of the ... you don't really notice it or something\nBut doing that jumpstart even just having the battery go dead first of all can cause serious problem I can cause problems or issues you know we have that the air conditioning motors are all electronic and control to blend doors and\nAnd uh they they lose their home so to speak they don't know where to end in the beginning and sometimes they won't reset our windows oftentimes our problem it's like your\nOld school VCR you know when the power went out you come in and the total auctions flash flashing flash and get your card credited or the same thing yeah I Know I never learned how to program VCR thank God she will get their DDR plug it in the noon [laughter]\nSo yeah I mean but yeah not having a jumpstart your car and the first place a is a good idea but you can have a battery fail after fourteen months sure you know I don't know where\nWe check them every time they come through the door and you know the the the test or it it comes up and it says battery bad and you're like well starts of the car okay how can the battery be bad these testers have gotten pretty advanced so we're there they'll they'll tell you ahead of time if there's a problem with the battery so\nPredicting yeah they're they're very sophisticated tested you know the old days we put a loan on it and watch how many ... they'll do it for hundreds dance or something but I don't know\nThing we call an automobile sitting out in the driveway or the garage or maybe you're sitting there right now and eventually if you own one you're going to have a problem with it and\nWe don't want you to have any anxiety and stress around that so when you you tune in and listen to the show and who your friends and neighbors and co workers to tune in because we we tried to make your life easy to make the carpet tickets take the all the stress and anxiety that it was so you're a little bit in the no and that's what\nThat's what we're here to do on the weekend so today we talked a little started to show about talking about jumpstart in in the ... to rules about jumpstart number one don't do it right ... to\nTry to make sure you know what you're doing and be careful if you can just avoid having the dead buried in the first place maybe get the car totally just put a new battery and it rather than having to have a jumpstart\nYou've ... you've Googled that right now that he's Mets got like a little six points sheet with a little\nAnd we just put a new battery in it rather than having to have a jumpstart\nAnd you've ... you've Googled that right now he's got like a little six points sheet with a little diagram the printed up off of a\nWherever hardly find your phone and then asked theory defined you tell me how to jumpstart car maybe she knows and\nWalk right through it on the on the in the parking lot if you had to but one of the thing jumped starts on the freeway doesn't work ... the batteries dead but that's just a symptom of the greater problem right oh so you're not and then you don't want to buy one of those batteries for the roadside service company where they drive around they got a van full\nBatteries and slap him in your car and and uh you know you want to make you just want to do on your term\nSo well you know you you said something there and I just had a that went like uh for the win but uh so we got James we got Ruth\nWe've got Bob we've got 'em and then we've got Marianne we're going to go to Mary has got a two thousand Thirteen Ford Edge how can we help you ... you are on bumper to bumper\nMarrying the afternoon guy Marianna Marianna around me can't read today that we were living in Little Rock\nOn and say what can we do every day\nSo symptom Yucca land for your regular oil it's home he has today I get the call of well we have a problem and I said okay\nI was told that I have a problem and that I Need that racking pinion replace a toilet sixteen hundred dollar bike\nAnd I'm okay [laughter]\nYeah now granted at doesn't drive any different no leaks whatsoever no weird noises whatsoever and so I was little ad\nTaken aback um for the oil change and I said in what I'll do that okay I'm In and stay tuned it when I told\nThem that or is this your regular shop or is this just simply she went for a change or how did that all go down\nAnd because it's a New York ...\nHonestly all I've got a call ... just the regular oil change as a kid okay so I'm I'm One of those that if it ever red flag like this concept\nThen it's time to go to my neighbor had stopped and get a second and third opinion sure and that's kinda where I'm at and that's why I'm here with you OK\nWell perfect I think you're at the right spot it's probably a good idea to get a second opinion it just 'cause you don't feel like on the ground doesn't mean that there's anything of that there's not something\nWrong but I mean come on day we've got to define is when there's a problem a problem with the league a leak and when do you quote so I pay attention to the words you need this or we have a problem what\nWhat is the problem when you show me yeah on the show me\nExactly in in this car I mean I imagine it's a you know five years old maybe it's got fifty to Seventy five thousand miles on it\nUm in in sometimes I Try and explain to my mechanics like okay you buy you buy a brand new pair of shoes you work for a week you asking me some words on the sole next week you know but that doesn't mean the shoes are bad so sometimes I look at stuff and I'm like you know that's like pretty much just superficial little\nDampness around the seal or something like that in some people with they get over zealous on recommendations that's that's the kind of stuff I worry about because sixteen hundred bucks I just don't have that laying around like I just want to go blow sixteen hundred bucks on a\nYou know and and I'm not experiencing a problem so I think a second opinion is a good idea now she said well I'll go over to my regular neighborhood shot ridge so I don't know maybe that was a place to be in the first place the place where you have the relationship the place where you're comfortable and all that stuff and\nAnd that's what we talk about it as having that relationship or it's not like a somebody's offering me six hundred dollars and repair I didn't even know I needed yeah you know I didn't really have a problem you know is it I'm not seeing a leak in the driveway\nYou know so it's not to say there isn't one going on\nIn in defense of the deal or we don't know but in and you know I used to get this I remember when I first opened the shop twenty five years ago you bring the car and we do to change that I call you up hey Mr Jones need brakes what do you do look at my breaks I just came in front of the oil changed okay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry the next you know then\nYou don't look at the breakneck I call Japanese dirty SOB last week like Harvard law changed number breaks are going to check my break so\nYou know we're the only thing we do don't we don't just do it now we prepare the customers to let them know we're going to be doing some level of inspection and with the service um\nBut just like your thought David just within the win but but if you have the relationship in with that shop you're not going to really second guess for for the most part\nAnd and but it's there do it's our due diligence were the professionals I think it's our responsibility and the consumers expect us to tell us when there's something wrong with a car I assume\nThat I just ask them or tell them I mean for me I Want us to look the rest of the ... one of his dumping pumping oil change like well yeah ...\nThere's something wrong with a car I assume\nThat I just ask them or tell them that mean for me I Want us to look the rest of the car is one of his dumping pumping oil change\nThough he adds up upon but if you see something it is ultimately our responsibility I mean there was a lawsuit up in Oregon I think it was not too long ago that they never even ... they settled\nThese people who worked in this car ten times over the last four years and they had to break failure the car had been in their shop um maybe even that day or week prior for a tire repair\nThey got caught up in the lawsuit because the ... they did nothing to the brakes they should've told this woman are they the\nYou know the insurance company was worried that if this went to court or jury they would've been said hey do your job to to inform these people this stuff but I I mean we're getting off change a little bit I think a second opinion is or in order for that and it and if you don't have a place if you do have your neighborhood shop but\nI wouldn't go get the second third fourth and you know opinion we need to\nFor sure if ... ... well let me let me go to get back to some phone calls here after the break we got a Tom Bob Ruth and James but I'm looking here my Land Rover shakes his one of the text that uh for one one nine to three my Land Rover shakes from time to time if I let go of the gas for a second in reply the gas it stopped shaking what do you think it could be\nI Know you're like you know basically with looking bad sides either he's just two hung over to answer this question\nOr [laughter] or you just these really confused so whoever six so to you know just getting a you\nKnow now that off the gas I mean I Wonder if that's a um\n[noise] there's some so many more things that would have the ... highway speeds and when I'm into the gas I get to shake and sometimes I think like a tire shake and you know in the\nGallery drive line shake or more or is it I've\nMissed fire because you're you're accelerated and causing the engine is fired the hard to say need more on that one for sure and it's so\nIt's so funny like once in a while we do we'll get a call and someone asked a question and in order going\nYeah you know that doesn't add up we've been through these conversations so many times over the course of doing this for for Twenty years that certain things makes sense in certain things don't make sense so but what what makes it fun if you got a question stumped as those of us would ever be so good\nOh yeah and and you know whether you're at the counter at the shop or comments on the rate we're going to you know we won't dig in his as hard as we would at the at the shop necessarily but we're we're going to ask you more questions and\nVery specific time sometimes does it feel like we're interrogating you give us all the information and do the the customer that whole stuff that we've had that happen to their embarrassed because they did something or they're they're\nAfraid to tell you I think they did something wrong to tell us everything that's going to end up saving you some money at the end of the day probably\nFor sure infer ... you know for ... phone call to a\nYou know continue ask more questions you know for us like if we see something as we can we read them on a scale of one to five you know you give me some sort of severity what I'm looking at here so we come\nBack six so to to seven seven five eight to Seventy ... guys bumper to bumper radio [noise]\nHonesty and integrity is the only option Hi Spencer do say for aging die

less than what the jumper cable on there at that time they hit the kid is the key well guess what happened to the battery battery exploded\nLike my mom and yet is the loudest one of the worst thing that ever happened to me well yeah that I ended up go ahead I ended up with a two day tour of a swine that hospitals ... a bandage for about a week\nI had had some battery splash that doctors are taking precautionary so just like you guys said\nIf you have a dead battery told jokes but if you can't\nWrite you know their means of getting that car started doing that jumped up battery but yeah the one that you guys this shop get it but actually they are a dangerous\nThey are a dangerous piece of equipment that some vehicle\nYeah ... you know they've got it it's like that or the bombs so to speak it's just very it's just sitting there by itself is not going to hurt anybody but but you do something wrong push to get a spark near to them and it's got a lot of potential go haywire real quick\nYeah so if you're not sure don't do it you know that would be the moral of the story here today let us foresaw that let us all up and says yeah that's right and it it's happened to experience people so current rock from you know uh yeah he's had had happened to him and he knows what he's doing their own cars a long time\nAnd uh you know he knew what to do any you know I mean you've got the guard you know a garden hose out he was where he could get washed off real quick but it's not a pleasant thing so uh thanks to the story Bob Let's go with a Ruth in may so she's got a two thousand ten Nissan ex Tara\nIt route that's what I drive minds of Thirteen ... but uh anyway what can we help you with\n... I had a couple things taken care of and I had the dealership kind of look at it over and make a list of other things that needed to be attended to one of the things on the list was ... and now they said I had craft and now well then shortly after I got that but it didn't\nSay it was or is it\nUm that shortly after that I had something else and then I asked the guy I said who I Need to get my end and now when he said well no not really it's not that critical so is there something I should look for in the way my car\nWhy are my truck why or operate that would tell me that the ins and outs are now at critical at a critical condition\nHe hit Ruth how many miles around your ex Tara\nAh about a hundred and ten thousand\nA hundred and ten thousand okay well here's what I can tell you is that motor mounts Heather window as failure that is somewhere between eighty thousand a hundred and twenty thousand miles\nThey can feel before that for sure you know at ... driving habits certainly play into this ah for me they last forty thousand miles because I'm full throttle er no throttle but um you know there's\nThere's there's a couple of ways if they fail they can separate were the two halves of the you know the rubber or actually separated that one you can you can actually feel in the car if you if it gets put on the breaking you give it gas you'll feel kind of the motor pick up and then drop back down so if you recall that power breaking sea power break the most you know you feel that\nYou're going all you have to drive and then read that first exhilaration you get\n... you kind of get a thought after about after three to five feet of movement from the vehicle that's a separate amount that's one way that fail the other way they feel is they simply sag or they compress and it's kind of like a mattress there just worn out\nAnd so you're going to feel more vibration from the motor okay\nAnd that's not something that's gonna separate amounts you got to deal with right away sacked down now it's not ... it's it's more of a comfort thing or you know for sure I think my ex terrorists got I think I'm sixty five thousand miles on it in the mouse are starting to you know I can feel a lot of that motor vibration coming through there\nNot because the motors run a bad because the Mets are bad\nBut it sounds like they just said hey they're starting to crack different tracks were going to keep an eye on them yeah which is good that's that's that's how it should be done just because something's got a little bit of weather checking or or like crack you know it doesn't mean you know what I see people recommend controller and ... and stuff it's\nOftentimes not necessary but that that you would feel and then the shop when they when they ultimately do go bad if you go to shop they should probably pretty easily be able to demonstrate that to you for senator bad to the heartbreaking motion and stuff\nOkay we're going to go to James in Chandler he's got a two thousand five hundred element how healthy James you're on bumper to bumper radio [noise]\nHi I'm my Honda Element when I turn right or turn left\nUm after maybe a checking in once I engage train ride or turning left a show a metal metal but and I can finally hear it coming from the front end of the suspension I was curious as to what you guys think that might be\nRight or left does the same said\nAh I initially I thought it was left only but um I think it may be coming from the left side of the car um it sounds like metal\nI initially I thought it was left only but um I think it may be coming from the left side of the car\nUm it sounds like metal metal I'm done with my ... ... it's the same and it doesn't do it every single time I turn by turn a little bit more sharply it does if I earn real softly it doesn't\nI Wonder if we get a ... a subway stop maybe or or talk so it's it's more so as full walk I mean if you were to like make a U turn it that was really going to be harsher as opposed to know the softer um\nNo I I I think if I just turn more aggressively even if I'm not a full lock 'em it it it still does it but\nDefinitely for sure if I Do pull off mic celebrating through the darn I can feel it or if I'm just turning sharply fast but then I can feel it too but it doesn't happen every time but it it it's gradually increasing over the last two months\nYeah well good what are the things that comes up for me on on the elements man they are just actual leaders you know uh you know so I don't think that's necessarily the Syrian he's describing but I think we may have a controller brushing or something\nSomething lose where you're getting a shift to get out of there are some you know and it may show up and be obvious if it's up and you know the technicians looking at it up in the air\nYeah I think a a test drive was with somebody that experienced and understand what's happening in the front end and probably uh I Would guess it fairly simple visual inspection and probably ought to handle that relatively quick end to him or you're down in Chandler we've got a couple a desert ... where we got a a DSM diagnostic specialist\nOn a general boulevard near I ten fifty six feet under\nWe got a Toyota cruel and our shop and the guy went to two shots before us\nOr because he's got this this he said he called the noise the steering talks to me first thing in the morning you know when I drive the car and we drove in ... and we heard noises and stuff\nBut we weren't sure that wasn't noises here and so we had them come down just to go for a test just to show somebody is talking about\nIf you take it into a shop jump get the technician in the car with you\nSo you can show him because you said it doesn't happen every time so it didn't happen every time rule number one and diagnostic is confirmed the issue so uh you know go for a drive with a technician if they're up to that anyhow when we come back we're going to go with Kurt Janet and Gina it wasn't a

do I it's a proper presentation it's making sure not just a presentation for the people who are listening but the presentation for the potential buyers yeah the house because that is ... ... ... it's it's very important\nYeah yeah it's not as much what you sell but how you sell it right how do you do a different\nWorld the biggest things that we do our obviously we talked about launching a home

and I buy her right\nMeaning that they submit their their address on line and then they get a computer generated offer and then over the course of a month or so that number winds up getting knocked down to something in St\nExactly it's a bait and switch kind of thing where they have one price they lock it you know right up the paperwork and then after the inspection period drop it way way way down right and so they say he doing\nWe're in a pickle you know we got the the offer from this company and it is low way low to lower we it works out for us and so we're launching their home or getting it on the market\nAnd our house is about ready to be done yeah their house is going to be done it's closing the new house middle middle\nEnd of November I have I've thirty days you know\nAnd so many people think hey there's only thirty days left to we close escrow in a brand new property there's no way we're going to be able to sell this house and of course a lot of home builders will go in and they'll make ... financial partnerships with some of the you know some of the institutional buyers out there\nOr the thinking hey we've got people coming in and they want to buy this house in thirty days we're going to send them over to you Mr I by air and you guys by the house and we'll split some of the proceeds make a little bit more money off of this but if you've got a short amount of time frame you can still list your house and get even more how much more money is are these people are gonna may\nTwenty to twenty five thousand dollars more than their eyes by or offer and if they
