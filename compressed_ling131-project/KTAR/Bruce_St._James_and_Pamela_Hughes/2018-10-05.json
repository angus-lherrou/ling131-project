[noise]\nArizona's news station Katie a our news for Ninety two three of them Bruce St James and families used\nToday is a is a bit of an anniversary it was one year ago on October fifth that we first heard let me call them the credible accusations against Harvey Weinstein the big Hollywood producer that for years decades he had\nUm with impunity sexually harassed and or raped women\nAnd with that sparking a global conversation about sexual harassment in the workplace folks one year ago this took place\nActress Ashley Judd says Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein invited her to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and asked her to massage and and watch him shower that's one of many allegations against Weinstein and the New York times allegations that go back decades ranging from sexual harassment to assault the times as many of the allegations were settled privately for money\nAnd someone denies but one thing quickly put out along statement acknowledging inappropriate behavior and saying he was taking a leave of absence from his company\nWorking with therapists to change his behavior\nOkay so that was one year out of the day and in the wake of that bombshell report in the New York times about Harvey Weinstein this spring up\nAfter all is a mulatto kicked off the trend boasting that anyone who's been sexually harassed or assaulted should write the words me too and replied or tweet and the ... hashtag took off like wildfire thousands upon thousands of women have been sharing personal stories along with celebrities including Lady Gaga Deborah messing show grow Evan racial wood and more\nAnd many men are joining in and support the movement comes out to the allegations against Harvey Weinstein opened up a new dialogue about harassment and assault in Hollywood and elsewhere\nI didn't know that all is a mulatto was the kick oh you didn't have to take me to have the actual ... yeah\nYes she's the one that started hashtags now too which makes it even more interesting that today is the one year anniversary of Harvey Weinstein hash tag me to [noise] you know what else is happening today\nThe Senate just voted to move forward with a vote on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a man who has been accused\nOf sexual misconduct and sexual assault with some different women when he went before the Senate Judiciary committee last Thursday Bruce for that hearing with him and you know ms Ford\nYou know who is sitting over judge Kavanaugh's right\nShoulder and I remember looking at going is that I don't yes\nI'm Alyssa Milano the actress I Know are from who's the boss more than anything um shows my age that uh she kicked out\nMovement she was sitting in the hearings for judge Kavanaugh and I find it so interesting how this has come full circle in one year we have more conversations on this radio program\nThere was a lot of turnover in the off season even amongst the players I wanted to say the cardinals had maybe the most new players on the roster does that make it harder because you don't have this cohesive leadership you guys have all been in it together and they're still they're still getting to figure out who the guy is at the end of the locker\nIsn't the problem is this right here it's not a lot of player turnover is one player ... quarterback okay Carson Palmer was a quarterback for the ... cardinals for five years and was the leader and was she was was was a leader\nThat documentary they an NFL Films about him and I was really impressed but yeah it was the other players talked about\nIt but it wasn't just that it was also where the entire culture that Bruce Syrians and his staff had built\nYou're replacing that entire ... culture about how you do things and how you go about your business and I'll listen Steve Wilkes loves the books that I Love what he's doing with his coaching staff there we're creating a culture nonetheless right now and it's going to take some time to get buy in from ...\nLet's talk about that so when you talk about the culture changing with a new coach you talked about the locker room changing with a new cue being a leader and along those lines fan is\nLosing confidence here and you know oh what are you can understand why does the optimistic how do the players feel about the confidence level of the coaching staff and the culture that's now being\nDeveloped yeah you know what a ... it's interesting you asked that question because for the most part right now players you know just go play just do your do your do your job period players know better than anybody else panel you bring up a very salient point though because if in fact if in fact\nThere are guys that are starting to huddle in the corners\nAbout locker room and say oh it's the coaches fault\nLet me tell you right now if you I'm a leader in that locker room I'm going to read that I'll get all weeded out and get it out because that is that is a losers mentality ... and she died\nWe should a dime for every time a player that played poorly sort of ... which is ... ... you know what shot it in ... but do your job well all I care about the employer is no better than anybody else\nRon willfully when they were sort of sports and obviously a cardinals color analyst with us right now the optimism for the cardinals is Josh Rosa a is ... and and and and the shot of doing to call it a to Z has an optimism it brings not just the fans but but that does that translate into in the\n... in on the team as well do they look at their kid and say here's a rookie and you know one\nOne here's boots jet ding ding ding ding really this is exactly what I'm Talking with the defense of football in the game of football it provides morale forget about this defense of football you know what you if you can't run the ball against the facts it's like\nThe guy you're skipping why don't you carry it out\nWith your defenses just piled drive in Europe and the morale that you feel on the sideline right\nOffers of football is about\nTwo different thing yeah I got it got to go through different things hope is like you were down by ten points but it's okay we are all we can come back after you're going to do is your job and

the vote that happened earlier this morning a and trying to discern what exactly the vote to end debate\nMeans for a vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in that kind of what people are trying\nTo go there trying to I think a lot of people that deserve to figure out what the cloture vote you know that's a vote to vote is really what it means um\nThe clock is now taking a firm that vote which has been what right around the eight o'clock Arizona timer so roughly they have thirty hours to debate before it would go to the full Senate so what happened this morning\nDoesn't necessarily mean that it is an indicator as to what's going to exactly happen tomorrow can be a good indicator much you're not exact your vote today has nothing to do your vote tomorrow\n... doesn't have to um and I think that you've got Susan Collins senator from Maine who is doing just that earlier this morning senator Collins who is one of the senators that you know we've been talking a lot about it you got to watch her because she has kind of\nBeen one of the undecideds that folks have been closely watching and she did in fact votes\nTo move forward with the votes as you wanted to get out of culture but she also said that that doesn't mean I'm going to vote to confirm him that she's still going through the information should still making up her mind\nA decision that apparently we're going to get a little clarity on around noon because at noon Susan Collins is going to be holding a news conference having some sort of an announcement we're getting married that lie for you right here on Katie a are but during the walk up\nTo that news conference hearing about an hour\nLunch and she had lunch with a a girl's gotta eat yeah I'll tell you I ain't that the truth [laughter] shouldn't lunch with a very important man in the\nSenate majority leader Mitch McConnell had lunch with senator Collins just moments ago along with other members of the Republican leadership like Senator John Cornyn the number two Republican McConnell emerged from that longevity would call in and said he was quote optimistic about the vote tomorrow Mm okay\nWell read into that McConnell optimistic about the vote tomorrow in other words I have fifty votes\nPotentially yeah potentially and and again I think we're going to get some clarity on that about an hour which you can hear live

law\nAnd quote\nOther sides met with have expressed concerns said Justice Kennedy's retirement threatens the rights of same sex couples to marry yet judge Kavanaugh\nDescribed the ... decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece cage cake shop opinion for the court's majority stating that\nQuote the days of treating gay

extreme views some birth control in one case judge cabinet and Curt that does favor or both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure\nThe availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections\nAlthough his critics frequently overlook is point\nJudge Kavanaugh's dissent rejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling\nInterest in facilitating access to contraception in fact he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was a compelling interest in facilitating access to birth control\nThere is also been considerable of focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concerns that judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn roe v Wade protecting this race is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh\nIs the first Supreme Court nominee\nTo express a view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition\nBut rooted in article ... three of our constitution itself he believes set precedent it's not just the judicial policy it's constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay he two roles of\nIn other words precedent isn't a goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenant that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further explain that President provide stability predictability reliance and fairness\nThere

and Planned Parenthood versus Casey\nI asked ... cabin or whether the passage of time is relevant to following president\nHe said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time\nAnd that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence\nOur discussion then turn to the right to privacy um which the Supreme Court relied in Griswold versus Connecticut a case that struck down the law banning the use since sale of contraception\nGrid swelled tablets the legal foundations that led to row eight years later\nIn just griping Britain's falls as settled law judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application of two famous cases from the Nineteen twenties\nMeyer and peer better not seriously challenged by anyone today finally in his testimony he noted repeatedly that roe had been up to help by Planned Parenthood versus Casey describing it as precedent unprecedented\nWhen I asked him what is being some fish than to overturn them long established precedent if five current justices believed that it was wrongly decided\nHe emphatically said no\nOpponents frequently side then candidate Donald Trump's campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn roe the Republican platform for all presidential campaign has included this pledge since at least Nineteen eighty\nDuring this time president Republican presidents have

pro choice groups vigorously opposed\nEach of these justices nomination incredibly they even circulated by and with the slogan and stop sued or or women will try\nJust two years later Justice Souter coauthored the Casey opinions reaffirming a woman's right to choose suffice it to say prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong\nThe same interest groups have speculated that judge Kavanaugh
