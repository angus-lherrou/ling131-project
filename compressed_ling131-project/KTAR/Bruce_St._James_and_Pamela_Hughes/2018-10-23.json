Bruce\nHere in Maricopa County in two weeks and some history on how well they must\nRead we have developed the ability to monitor the length of our voting lives in every single polling location in Maricopa County in real time\nTour knowledge this is the first time in the history of American elections were a department has internally created a real time information about the length of voting lines in every polling location in the entire jurisdiction that we will have live information for\nSo you'll be able to find out exactly how long the line is at your polling station in real time\nThey do this at the airport like the TSA line is X number I've seen I've seen hospital you remember when they used to do that on billboards mhm but I and I probably I don't remember which hospital was doing it but it was like the wait time at our emergency room is eleven minutes and I was like\nWhy why do I need at what what are you know that I don't know like the DMV never\nAdvertises the wait time but you know they just don't want to know\nThey do at the ... where you get your missions oh yeah on line I Know I I Want to ... so they're kind of taking that technology and applying it to voting\nWell it is pretty simple technology because here's how they're going to monitor the lines\nEach hour on the hour the Marshall for each polling location will take one of the language that we will have prepared if we want to win so we didn't do well it's got to keep your coat on it it's really nice uh and they'll scan it on the site the marshals and pick the one in here to the last voter in law and whether it's to voters or two hundred voters\nAnd ask them to scan it again when they get to the front of the ... the back of the line and we'll have a little explanation about why we're doing this\nThis will give us real time monitoring capabilities for every single location\nBut let's say thirty minutes passed between the top of the hour and the last person skin in the ... that lets us know without having to bother coworkers how long the line is\nThey'll know that getting the data and they'll know that it's it's taking maybe longer than usual and they're going to like they have like the strike team sick SEAL Team twelve for the Maricopa County reporters a strike team that will immediately be deployed\nPamela I I don't know what did I didn't but you sound you hear what's going to happen\nIf our system shows lines forming and wait times increasing will be able to call the polling place and ask if things are going well we can respond immediately with backup equipment our stuff as necessary for the situation builds into something tangible\nUp we're going to be back I Love it\nI Love this idea I honestly don't even bother with I think it is it's great because there were a lot of issues during the primary is this going to mitigate them on sale at is it it's a step in that direction I still\nThink the problems at polling centers are over blown\nA and and you know what initially I had that perception on primary day when we first took to the air and I agreed with you but as the day went on and as the story developed in as we learned\nThe option on primary day when we first took to the air and I agreed with you but as the day went on and as the story developed in as we learn\nMore about it you know there were problems there were real problems the real problems and the lack of organization getting the tax or the technology necessary up and running in time for people to cast their ballots now by the end of the day they did fix those issues but there were religious\nWhere people were having a hard time passing valid or they had to cast a provisional ballot when this is a place that they voted for years and years and years\nAnd my point being those few examples are a minute percentage of the number of people that vote\nYeah but when you compare it to the issues that we had in this primary in past elections I mean even the the general election for president was problematic\nA new study out there this this could be good news bad news if you're a smoker you could actually see this next story is good if you're lazy and a couch potato

R. news\nArizona's news station Katie a our news on Ninety three SM Bruce St Jean ... and ... you can use\nTechnology and where does it in now listen I Will acknowledge and drank Pamela into\nThis and we're going that way\nAnd I will acknowledge and drag Pamela into\nThis ... we're we're going to you know we both share some of the concerns of people like you are most\nUh um uh you know who who talked about the dangers of artificial intelligence the dangers of some technology I use the term you know ... named the technological advance out there that has been weaponized so I Would know dreaming there are\nLimits to technology Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawking me the same argument\nWell the Swedes say we see your concern those people in Sweden we laugh you\nKnow we are ridicule\nUs and that's because ... not just a couple not three not five of them not one guy on Twitter loads of 'em are paying a hundred and eighty bucks each\nTo get ... like your dog right microchip like your dog when you say not you know dozens or hundreds\nLaughing about thousands and thousands of yeah all the leaves to begin with it's not a very big ... they're having\nThese microchips implanted under the skin think between like your your thumb in your point a finger on on the back of your hand and you know little that little area there and it it's\nAbout the size of a grain of rice and it's just injected into your skin it sounds simple enough right and it can replace credit cards keys\nPersonal identification if you want like loyalty cards it's also for gym memberships\nI mean think about anything that you would have like a key fob right okay makes you wouldn't be able to access\nWith your hand ... and a lot of privacy advocates are concerned about this particular why because everything has ... All right so everything is hack of all\nAnd when you start planting things under your skin that's a little difficult to change so there is this technology about I shouldn't yeah all all ...\nBut then it seems that privacy advocate and that's where I I\nI fall on the side of gas okay [noise] but then you've got\nOther individuals who are concerned about this for a very different reasons and we asked you on the open Mike line six so to two hundred two seven three three if you would get this microchip if you would consider it and the calls we received present another side to take a listen\nThis is Jen calling us from Phoenix about the microchip thing no I definitely would never do it to me it is very for telling of the market the beast ah which has spoken about ah quite frequently and the New Testament and the book of revelations so absolutely not\nOut of Phoenix microchip talking about ... coming right out of the Bible I Will not be able to fire so\nWell how different is open from tattoos [noise]\nYoung and and okay so what's the big deal and I'm like what's the big deal if you wake up every morning looking to be outraged about something you're going to find it and it just seems to be\nOr we reaching to find something to be outraged about\nDoes it get does it get down to the point that you this tribalism again but you would only watch a movie that has people who you're you see reflected\nReally boring person I don't watch\nA bunch of stuff about boring people I Want to learn about things I don't know I Want to go to places I've never seen I Want to learn about culture is I've never experienced and I do a lot of that on Netflix through documentaries for example\nWell I think you could make an argument also the mess which tries to manipulate people in a variety of ways are still ... name any company that doesn't yet to understand where this suggested for you comes from you know like it just makes no sense whatsoever you know I watch a a documentary on Mexican drug cartels\nAnd it's just because you watch the documentary on Mexican drug cartels maybe you'd like to see Barney show\nEither\nAbout how you know you're just throwing darts at a board that like that isn't a real algorithm sea so Netflix is now being\nForced to respond to these claims that they changed their artwork of shows based upon viewers race\nAnd again I think that this is absolutely the fake outrage of the day because I Am a heavy Netflix consumer yeah I don't have cable I cut the cord so my options are who Netflix and Amazon Prime that's it so I watch a lot of Netflix and I did\nFord so my options are who Netflix and Amazon Prime that's it\nSo I watch a lot of Netflix and I did notice that change the beginning of this year and that change was that art work is no longer static it changes it'll change literally\nTwice a day I die I haven't noticed that necessarily I noticed that mostly though Bruce with the net flicks dominant theory is like you know for instance like that and\nOrange is the new black dog so that that didn't cover our\nWill change with orange is the new black because it is a Netflix series I first noticed it with Thirteen reasons why you'll also noticed that with [noise]\nWhat ranger thing but here's what I ... and I don't disagree I think the argument is that those shows you just said how what do I want a whole ensemble cast of of people it's not just one star and a bunch of other people that\nUnder hand things that you know it has a cast of individual stars what they're arguing is and the argument that people are making is they are taking obscure people of color in a film and using it to market it to people and get in an effort of tricking them into thinking this is a movie starring that actor\nYeah well how some cars had\nOne star Kevin Spacey prior to the whole life and it's okay to to I'm All right I mean but there was in an ensemble yes there were some other pretty dominant\nCharacters what when are they using the and I don't remember his name the black actor who was the lobbyist mhm member of the kind of yeah I remember I don't know what are they using his picture Remy\nRarely hear oh what about ... the guy who made ribs the ribs guys were they using him to market to have you somehow some ... a lot of no I couldn't remember remedies there he was ... yeah wow that I think it's all I Do\nThink it's totally peeling back to the the cover of how marketing works and how these companies\nAll of them are trying to in some way shape or form entice you to use their product watch their service whatever it might be\nAnd they're doing it with any means if they're just yeah Netflix if they're not the only ones no I mean hello I see t._v. were raised with

twenty five with a clean air fee editor rides to help drivers go green it's part of Hoover's effort to cut pollution and the British capital\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer to your question overall is if someone's uninsured well yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nWould be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kinda gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do ah sometimes it's very very expensive uh but again you might be worth it or if you've got a non medical renewal it might just jump way up like triple or something what you're paying now kind of thing um so what did you have\nLike a ten or twenty year term it's run out right twenty or turn when we first got married yeah okay All right you know that that's um\nYeah you would see you would see it go up you just to buy a twenty year term at forty rather than at twenty obviously\nBut in your case if we did a non medical renewal most of them have that so I Would check that that's the other thing then lastly or not lastly the next thing I Would do is just start looking around for gimmick type non medical policies policies that don't check medical\nAnd that's like ten thousand dollars issued through your bank or with your checking account\nAnd you can buy now the price per thousand is really stupid Hi okay but if you had ten of those and had a hundred thousand bucks lined up 'cause you've got some gimmick stuff that's better than having no insurance\nOkay but again you're always measuring then back against that what is costing you know what I pay a thousand dollars a year for ten thousand dollars worth of insurance no\nRight now but what I pay a hundred bucks for that policy in this situation may be and that's really high for a forty year old per thousand you see what I'm saying\nSo you know it's just a matter of relative cost to the amount of coverage and and just does it give you sticker shock when you look at it the last thing of course is if you remain on ... a long term your goal would be the same\nAs it would be for those who have insurance and that is by getting out of debt and building wealthier need for insurance goes away\nOkay because if you have a million dollars in your four one K. and you have no debt house or anything and you die your wife can probably make it\nOkay the medical data that's called self insured in other words\nOkay with the increase maybe the amount of the emerging he found at all if I'm remain in trouble\nProbably yeah yeah um\nYou know just because again she's going to be facing something and that would be part of your self insured wealth building picture that we're trying to go for long term and we go for that either way I mean the goal is raise the kids get them out of the house so they're not there to have to be fed right\nA goal is to get the house paid off and everything else paid off and then build a huge mistake if you've done those three things you know somewhere in your fifties or sixties you becomes completely self insured maybe sooner because your wife would be okay if you left behind with a huge pile of money no debt and the kids are gone\nThat makes sense and so we work towards that that is why we suggest term insurance sister the one of the reasons we should just term insurance because ... as you were finding out runs out so it's a couple of three suggestions there but I'll tell you this I think within five years you're in trouble\nOkay if you stay clear of the diabetes if if the diagnosis doesn't recur\nSo on but designer can tell you more or it used to be that if you had diabetes or cancer or heart you were just done no no no amount of time but the insurance market has gotten much more
