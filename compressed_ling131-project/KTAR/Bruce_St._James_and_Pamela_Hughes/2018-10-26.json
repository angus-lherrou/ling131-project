prevent that and that idea seems to be wrapping up a bit\nThe estimated eight hundred to a thousand active duty troops when deployed to the border to help with logistics like building fences\nOr putting up pens for border authorities that service members would not be working in a law enforcement capacity or engaging with migrants defense secretary James Mattis would sign off on the order they're ready to sounds and National Guard troops at the border called up by southern governors\nNow just a few moments ago super producers DVD handed us this paper that said that defense secretary Jim Mattis has approved\nThe homeland security requests for more U.S troops to be dispatched to the border just how many and what the details are they're still working through that and they say that that planning is probably going to have to work its way through the weekend\nWell we we know before wasn't there was a National Guard before yet another goes out and yeah that that that was a couple of months ago I I Apologize I give a timeline different states decided and Arizona is one of them was one and that was over the summertime when the last ...\nOf a Central Americans that's about right you remember was June July August June maybe\nI'm not exactly sure when you had the the zero tolerance policy and you're having families where children are being separated that's where that sort of the ramp up\nFair enough what did they do when they got down to the border because it's pretty indicative of what the military will be doing now right you know you can learn from what the last group did and we learned that most of them did um a procedural secretarial kind of desk work to free up border patrol agents to go do other stuff\nYeah and that's what we're hearing what happened in this capacity as well that we're hearing the initial estimate anywhere from eight hundred thousand service members could be sitting down and they would be there to set up tents for the border authorities they'd help maybe constructs fencing to separate the you know which is separate from the border wall we hear so much about\nAnother you know I don't I don't know what she ignorant here's a definition of ignorant\nLacking knowledge or awareness in general an educated or unsophisticated yes she lacks the knowledge and the history and the awareness in general of blackface and and how offensive that is to an entire\nCommunity so ... so the discussion was aren't racist you could argue well you can also argument races\nI understand that it's a it's a topic that is a hot button topic and I I think that there are a lot of white\nPeople who are ignorant to the history of\nThey know what it is and they do not to do it they know what's inappropriate but where it came from and the stereotypes of African Americans and uh it was white people really making fun of them running them into like you know the jurors owners no doubt that the original history you think of like these are the old black and white\nAnd making fun of them threatening them into like you know the jurors oh there's no doubt\nThat the original history you think of like these uh these old black and white movies where they wouldn't allow black people to be in a film so to portray them they took a white actor in ... and and put them in black base there was an inherent racism and that and they never portrayed necessarily a good way no right now you okay so we can acknowledge yet\nBut not understanding and and I guess I don't I Can't look into making Kelly's heart in her mind do you think it's possible that she just didn't really didn't see like what's the big deal\nI think it's possible but then you start going back to other instances and things that she has said in the past which people have done when she was on Fox News big name on Fox News her she made some other comments like this one Bruce\nYet another person I mean it's racist white Santa\nAnd by the way for all your kids watching at home than I can wait for this person is just arguing that if that maybe we should we should also have a black man\nYeah so you've got that\nYou you had her doubling down a little bit more on the today show earlier this week this was right after the blackface come and take a listen\nIt was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and she made her skin darker than it really is and people said that that was racist and I felt like could one day she wants to look around for one day I I don't know how that got races are hollow why\nIt it take neurons and she apologized for it um but it seems to be too little too late there there seems to be several instances not just one where she made a mistake or maybe an ignorant mistake and so here's the fall out of\nIt just days after Megan Kelly stirred up controversy in the discussion about Halloween costumes in blackface Megan Kelly today is done NBC saying in a statement quote Megan Kelly today is not returning next week the not in our will be hosted by other today co anchors Kelly apologize for comments but apparently that wasn't enough\nYou know so she made a mistake of big one she apologized for it not an\nAunt and her mistake was not understanding the historical background of\nBlackface not couldn't do it and that's not dressing up her so she dressed in blackface and showed up on TV we would not be having this argument correct\nAbsolutely not but you will have others out there who say you know she is a decorated journalists she is a former attorney she is very intelligent what do you\nMean she didn't know the history and what do you mean she was just being ignorant set the record straight right here right now don't do it don't defend it don't do it it's\nWrong and\nShe's paying the price for it\nI think you and I both agree that there was something else going on maybe NBC was looking for an excuse\nMe and it wasn't really that NBC that's been a very rocky relations right she's come they're not a lot of people fighting for her internally going she was this other stuff no\nNo you got ... and others are all she was a bigger apology than the one she was given\nWe

Florida this morning together they brought justice as they always do\nThe wide experience of our agencies coupled with the individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad or highly trained emergency service unit or intel bureau a counterterrorism bureau\nAre patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset and we would identify and arrest the person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have no ability to investigate it deliberate precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers and indeed people across our nation are safe but it's direct ... said that might be more packages

here [noise]\nI Would say a just a also remarked that uh since Tuesday along with a director re this has been our number one focus of the agency is to find the perpetrators\nOf these incidents and they're bringing the justice thank you [noise] can you\nAlong the lines of how fast is\nWhen you were close I think [noise] ah so\nEach of the devices was being brought a through what are called total containment vehicles to our lab and they were coming kind of Syria autumn a and we received some of them the first to the we were see where the devices that were sent to former President Obama\nA and the D.C package that was sent a congresswoman waters and so the analysis began on that I think yesterday and we were started receive information over the course of the last twenty four thirty six hours though it was about\nTo fall [noise] question\nA professor\nDescribe your reaction to when\nFor\nThe first part of my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match or just validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in the mental and law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab\nThere's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who worked there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had to print\nI was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves a it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nOr that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say so we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat for shock of friction I could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that according\nTo how could you tell us plainly why was targeting\n\nI don't know and then uh what you might uh normally expect a a may have been apart ... appears to be a partisan but that would be a determined by the facts\nAs the case goes forward and I'm not able to comment on that [noise]\nWe're not as it were investigations fans at\nThis time [noise]\n[noise] an hour is what\nGiven more for\nFocus not on the talk but on the works the working men and women of law enforcement here in the work that was done over the last week is something that should make every American proud and grateful and it's too early stage for us to be discussing motivation in this particular [noise]\nJust decided oh I Love her out of business you know I'm so we we don't we're not love with it uh and we have different goals in our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of in the plan which we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put uh some of the other money put it in as our emergency fund and then either rent for a short period of time what we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm so I [noise] um\n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of this equation um but I Will be a straight with you I I'm afraid\nI'm hearing something else that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that is not a script I Want to join in on\nOr you can be happy and make more money\nAnd this idea that in order for your life to be good you have to take a dumbed down job and you're not living to your potential and I'm not suggesting you'd go back into a high stress situation but I'm doing something you love you could make double what you're making now and it feels a little bit like your surrendering settling\nDropping down into something I don't know if I'm hearing that but I'm afraid I'm hearing that\nWell actually long term goal I Do want to own my own business\nUm this was to get me back working and to have an income um we we were already planning you know long term things and we knew that getting out at that was our way to get\nTo where we want it to be so yeah I Want to make more money okay right now it it it facilitates me working and working on our future plans\nOkay All right I'm ... and so this this um moved down in house you're moving more than half of house uh it sounds like a ultimately bill that even if you rent for six months or something and I moved back in this price range\nOr you know it wouldn't if you worry wouldn't make any sense I'm ... and so this move down to half of the house is probably a three to five year plan\nCorrect okay\nAll right because you're going to do something to get your income back up a without having to completely sacrifice your soul at work I get that part I'm not asking you to do that but I also there's a there's an equation out there that's floating around in the culture that I'm kind of working against subtly and that is is that in order to be happy you have to make less money\nAnd that's not an equation I'm going to participate in agree with those that usually means that you just didn't go do something that God designed you to do because you were afraid\nAnd I don't participate in sphere so um but again I'm not trying to destroy your family or anything like that this is a sizable step back for you all in order to take big steps forward as long as you don't take this sizable step back and settling in and make it your life\nThen I'm cool with that that's kind of where I'm saying so I Hope that helps a good question and a courageous decision on your part to do that and James is with us in Rochester, Minnesota how James how are you\nI'm pretty good thank you for taking my call sure what's up I'm ah [noise]\nWell I I got married last year got your book is a proven ever heard of before that and then ah I'm all on board and my wife has left so she's kinda just going along with it but I mean she's not because they'll and I'm willing to be how old are you I'm\nI'm thirty and she's twenty two so she's kind of going through I don't know a front page he makes twice as much as I Do a year and uh it's hard for me to say no we can't go out for dinner or no we can't go to the mall for a day um because she makes so much more than I Do [noise]\nUm so you lost your ability to vote in the household based on the economics\nIt's it [noise] that's pretty lame no I still have a vote at I I like it just is not as large as hot as ...\nBased on the economics it it [noise] that's pretty lame no I still have a vote and I\nI like it just is not as well as hot as my she just got to you got one\nKind of that that's how I feel that's probably not how she feels at all okay\n... because that's not a good way to have a relationship but you should not make decisions together based on who makes the most money has the most which that's not a good plan especially when one of your starting and the other one's twenty two\nOkay so you got a little more life experience could we agree on that\nThat's all right okay good and that's not to say she's in up to twenty two but in this case uh apparently she is so uh in in this particular subject so how are we going to do this year started talking about what\nWe need to do we don't need to go to the mall we don't need to spend so much money we need to get out of that you started talking about what after you read my book instead of talking to her about how and why\nYou sit down together and dream and say well what if we were out that we have no doubt at all\nWhat what what if we had a million dollars what would we do what could we would we travel would we give more generous late to causes what what do we do if we had a million dollars well what's the shortest path to get to that dream\nOf being able to do those things the shortest path is to live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else the shortest path is to be dead free and living on a plan and adults devise a plan and follow it children do what feels good\nIt's a sign of maturity to learn to lay pleasure emotional maturity whether you're twenty two or fifty two\nIt's a sign of emotional maturity and so this is how you need to lead in your household duty to serve your wife\nAnd what you're going to be doing you need a big why I think we're talking about what all the time\nAnd because she is and bought into the what\nShe doesn't have a Y. somehow you got the why early in the discussion now you've got to transfer\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nImagined traveling to places you'd never thought you'd reduce\nThe lifetime
