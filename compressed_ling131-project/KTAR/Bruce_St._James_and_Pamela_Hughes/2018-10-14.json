usually governments are big institutions\nIt's always a version of the truth when it gets to you and me it's only a version of the truth when it gets to you and me\nSo we've got to do our best to get as many versions as we possibly can to make up our mind the best 'cause I wasn't in that conflict and I'll never be in that conflict well maybe one day I could get into the call so but I wasn't there when cars so do you is there if he was there I don't know\nYeah I don't plan on sitting down and talking to president heard want anytime soon I'm not going to get that kind of access neither are you most likely\nSo we're never really got to know what's going on just like we don't know what's going on in Syria we don't know\nAre journalists here in the United states for the most part around the world decided we're going to pass on this a war we're going to call ourselves war correspondents in St recovering wars we're just not going to cover it it's like the firemen who says I Can't go into the burning building\nWell you call yourself a fireman yeah I'm Still a fireman but I don't fight fires oh\nOkay great that's where we are besides\n... are also in Turkey this past week the American pastor Andrew Brunson whom everybody should know if they listen to this program maybe if you don't you still know about it to\nA there he has been jailed American side says this is a you know the this is like North Korea where they're just jailing Americans and using them as as as as Bates for political or a shenanigans a turkey says oh he's an intelligence officer\nA and somehow Trump managed to pull them out now of course Trump says there was no deal made there is no quid pro quo I'm highly skeptical of that but again it's a version of the truth is that's what I can go with right now we will start with ... and then get into cars so Julie they'll use I chatted with them from the streets of Istanbul you'll hear a little bit of\nAmbient noise in the background uh but uh if you listen carefully don't be distracted turn of the volume on whatever device you're listening I chatter by asking OU's why he thought Brunson was finally released and returned to the United states\nThat was a lawyer in the United states I'm Sorry I started ... after all all the negotiations given [noise] now they decided to let him go [noise]\nWhat do you think the deal was I mean why do you what what do you think the United states and turkey agreed upon for his release\n[noise] well a lotta a lotta [noise] probably a goodly around America ... as well thanks shuttle regarding turkey [noise] a little bit better in a world turkey from now and I think that was\nOkay so it was money yeah [noise] do we know do we know really what Brunson was held for I mean is there any idea why turkey was putting him in jail or under house arrest what the deal really was with him\n[noise] well what I think they want it to a last ditch the first place because all the you know such pastor\nLiving in thirty or I'll order first city such as the most well they are on at school are asking if the guy\nThat was what about that but I don't hear the creative shirts or terrorist organization it would have had you know the age of the United states that that turkey one or two old and I see a critical older like more and I've been back there\nDoes it have anything to do is to look good on\nWell yeah I mean that is so cheap feel desperate leading he's done once it's like you're a United States that ... well you have to look at let's say shooting in order for us to see what's going on regarding him and that would be a little bit of this is talk is not selling any of the nation because they are all\nAlmost kind of live so\nHow does it play where you are then if if the United states has a a a religious person\nThat's being held a in in in one country in this case turkey and they say we want him ... we want him in the United states and now that have and so ... back in the states and for the last couple of years president or to want to say the same thing we've got this guy that's living in the United states that we want\nBack in Turkey for too long ago and but the United states won't return them and they haven't been able to get them does it look bad for you to want if when you look at it from that perspective\nThey want if when you look at it from that perspective you know man for man\nAll new to say that could be a tough call because we have to look when you couldn't fire federal law and brought in the city they might have something to do with their own country a little different agendas how they were affected look good on his ... private much more of an issue of like one on\nThe war so I wouldn't say turkey let Bronx and go and that's that's a lot to be taken back to Seattle ... ... that's the case\nWhere do you think the release of Brunson leaves the relations between turkey and the United states\nWhat I think the relationship with the pension wise it might be getting a little bit ... by the army talks but they are going to be here\nHigh high tension but it it's still not going to be as cool as it were but it can get better but just a little bit not watch because Trump is still saying\nOh we didn't do any bark if we just\nWant to in Baghdad this is what the hat and thanks for the ... people who spend some efforts regarding that are are going to they acting created a mentioning Donald Trump just from the little slowly realistic that sets it up so everybody gets their parts of\nThe day that the relationship between turkey and the United states can get small sir\nBut as I told you not that huge impact by respecting\nSo he was also in the past few days there was a story about a a Saudi national who's been living in the United states he's a journalist working for\nThe Washington Post and he was in your home town of Istanbul talking to you from at the consulate of Saudi Arabia and the whole world now knows and the whole world is talking about this\nUh your government turkey says that this this man went into the Saudi conflict and was murdered inside there and and they've got the death of this\nIs your government offered proof publicly to say look we know this is what happened\nWell what I what I see is Turkish government reacted to the situation at all uh they said this is unacceptable and he's a little bit of ... it's as big as deep as the guy goes against what I\nWell above what I what I get the feeling is all the media in Turkish media reported all over the video footage as if they had they had access to\nFederal grants to security a camera they don't they don't have such access so what I think you know what I feel some parties are let's say governmental audio somebody I'll just served\nThe flow to adjust to\nDo you have a given you create an image of Saudi Arabia I think he was he got back to the states this is what I think but I'm not sure and ABC was murdered or not but obviously thought the ...\nI Want to make sure I understand you correctly you think he may have been kidnapped and sent back to the United states\nOr are they not United States to the back to the Saudi\nSaudi Arabia okay so back to Saudi Arabia and he's he's just being held there and nobody knows well the only the only those people in Saudi Arabia know where he is and that's why everybody saying he's disappeared\nExactly and so there are many console cars\nHow to be a Congo the general and living a couple of callers is that if there is this your is this good journalists are reported missing and then those are tons of uh guys or see at the airport truly in a private jet so you know\nIt gives you an idea\nWhy do you think early on in his government are making sure that the whole world knows what they believe about this\nFisher thing I mean I don't know what it is exactly but over here to stay somebody is giving somebody a message because you don't see ...\n... it is one guy is getting lost in the little general it's issues that want to carry and everybody knows about circuits serving older ... older I'm picking national it till that say everybody is all about\nHow come it's hosted should I've been to pick it up or I should do they want to literally kill him and ...\nThey can be anything like that that\nIs their truth to the to the story that a hustle gee the Saudi in Istanbul was there because he wants to marry a woman who is a Turkish\nCitizen and he was trying to get the proper paperwork so that he could get married you know if that's true or not and\nI'm not sure about that\nDoes anybody know about

control of all the\nAudio now because as I said I Am in a remote studio and are you are there but again we aim to please we do whatever we have to do to get the changes are several because that this is the one segment that it's not about us it's about helping the people\nAbout us it's about helping the people it's about doing it for the kids as we always talk about it as a public service segment and this is good for Trump and breakfast\nSo I'm ... you just played one of our many a little sound effects that serve many purposes most importantly though to prove over and over again that those in power or like to keep us in an emotional state\nA kind of like ... and so we play that sound or you know lots of sound effects and explosions lots of drama because it keeps our listeners are constantly in an emotional state and when their emotional their intelligence goes down and then they're more easily manipulated\nHere and so Don Lemon now is trying to say that he's he's diagnosing as

I this is my contribution when you told me about this in these some of these cuts I'm hearing for the very first time as I mentioned the or you're in charge of this but the one contribution I made it to this week is and I literally just made it within the last half an hour I said\nWhat's your show what you're telling me just happened what two weeks ago in the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nominations where you had blogs e Ford testifying\nAnd there was the lady that was brought in from Arizona and she was cross examining or doing her questioning you know doing it for the G O O G O P guy said I'm not going to ask any questions you know I'm going to go to the broader in and she asked questions but it was very interesting to me because\nIt's the same thing where you know afford said you know there are at least three people there and we can understand why Brett Kavanaugh would deny doing it and maybe Brett Kavanaugh's buddy I Can't remember which one it was worth the risk wherever [laughter] I don't work for it or whatever his name is right but then there was the girlfriend her friend but she says ... you know she said she was there\nAnd and and remember what she said when she was asked will hold on you say ... was there and you say she was your friend but she says\nIn essence your lying that she doesn't know Brett Kavanaugh she has no recollection of this party or anything that you're saying why would she said that and we have the clip of what she responded oh yeah we do now\nAnd I had a cat how talented and I'm happy that his focus herself and paying\nHalf the ... and she let me now that he needed to take cats for her\nThat's awesome I mean that is the best I mean you think about that and you're looking at the Kanye West I mean you're asked why she basically calling you a liar she's got health issues and I'm really rooting for that\nKind of health and but I Love her for it I Love it [laughter]\nI mean am I wrong turn down that road now she's crazy but but I'm praying for oh okay I think that will\nDo it for are you are unique a form of a\nChange is hard today or did the video work by the way and we were getting people 'cause I Can't see I'm blind I

change Brexit and the Trump five star movement Italy all of that\nSort of come we've got our global media spotlight not one but\nTwo we go to Europe and into the middle east to cover two big stories paying for Donald Trump and the curious so gee case which is our lead story today if you just tuning in\nAh hopefully you'll listen to this entire a program you want to hear from our voices throughout the middle east including the streets of a turkey about this American resident working for the Washington Post Saudi national ... and the whole world is not reacting\nFrom celebrities to presidents to kings and their economic issues involved and all of this uh did this journalist and critic of the Saudi Government cause so gee\nLiterally get lured into a consulate in Istanbul and get killed that's where Turkey's government says Saudis are denying it Donald Trump's kind of on the fencing well if it happens\nYou want to hear how the media in the middle east are covering this and what they think the United states knew beforehand and what they must do now is this is a story that interest you you want to hear that's coming up in a few minutes an update on a story we've been covering for you\nBut again is a hugely underreported story in North America or the America's longest war which is the af Pak or\nUh what is it going on Seventeen years now Trump and his crew are still meeting with the Taliban which of course again officially the Taliban were not supposed to meet with because they were a terrorist group but uh again what what labels meat in this day and age now with these standards and\nAnd labels are we blow right through just about everything you know you go low we go high now everybody says well we don't need to go low we are going to go lower the loan we're going to kick them even though we say we're going high\nA trumpet still meeting with the Taliban there was a meeting apparently within the last forty eight hours in Qatar where Taliban have long held a you know what an office there so that these meetings could be held\nIn of course everybody kinda you know they don't nowadays they don't deny that these meetings are occurring but they weren't officially say and it's just a little charade that goes on and again uh you know our media are getting corporate owned media that are important only in\nThat they have massive distribution in one of the pillars of the voice of America program is a\nPopular media foreign public opinion public opinion forms public policy but if the popular media or choose to cover a story or not cover a story then the masses the lemmings the goats\nThey never get the information and so they can't be influenced and this is what's happening without back\nBy the way would we hear from our people is is that Trump is put on the table\nThey one hundred percent pull out of us troops from the af Pak war America's longest war\nWhich is certainly far but you always have to ask the question what does the United states get in return for the longest war in which thousands died trillions of binge [noise]\n\nPod casting isn't affordable solution for driving revenue in creating brand awareness millions of people listen to pot

covered it and maybe we'll get an idea of how can how can the what is the truth of the story what everybody's got a different version and they're all claiming I've got the story here we are on voice to America\nDidn't the Saudi Government uh duct and mud or Saudi journalist on foreign soil and if so will there be any consequences at the moment of coal Saudi Government officials refuse to pay on al Jazeera and other well known defenders of the Saudi Government who we approached to participate in the show declined our invitation\nBefore we begin I'd like to play a clip that at an earlier this year which I asked him all why he chose a life of self ... in the United states\nShouldn't be because I didn't want to be understood or they'll thought to be an extra ... or ... of some of the ...\nThe the ... that he has no opposition missing money doesn't up a position he doesn't have the money back on us cut us off in in in a gun is done most of the people most of the intellectuals most of the people in jail today are supposed to fit for\nA ruler the Washington Post a wedding Jamal 'cause she'll be a right to call them is reporting this week the U.S intelligence\nHas worked out to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia NBS Lama been some unquote ordered an operation to gym all back to the country and then the pain in the Turkish government say that he was killed inside the calling so and it's done little by a Saudi payment on his body dismantling of war and what do you believe happened to your friend Jamal\nI Believe that had been held in mind is capable of fourteenth stands accused off off kidnapping however that U.S intelligence\nShould have warned him out and it's also there's a lot of blame to but also on us media I Believe ... has life and family to tell the truth and all of us what was going on\nIn Saudi Arabia and what this crime France for a what some me dead it's basically for the ... the propaganda of this crown prince\nHe he's a reformer and a mother and liberal in the woods of Tom Friedman in the economist and others\nIt's outrageous we have an obligation there's a journalistic and thank God and then in this case it was betrayed totally and they fail spectacularly it's mitigated disaster ... all of us had cause in the middle east and for Americans and especially for people who have no interest\nLifetime out except telling the truth and informing the public opinion\nA salary you document human rights abuses for a living you have to distinguish between Fox and fiction between a credible reporting and conspiracy theories [noise]\nA lot of people are saying how can we know for sure what happened inside of comfort in Istanbul given the prime source of information as the Turkish government which has its own issues with the Saudi Government and what you have a great record when it comes to its own journalists to solve that record right\nUm well the the main reason that we can know one thing very concretely is that obviously we're not just relying on what the Turkish government has said ah we're relying on the testimony of his fiance whom I spoke with a on that day or on which semi disappeared\nInto the consulate while she was still at the consulate\nA quick look at how old is your the CNN in the middle east covered this story about ... very interesting too when you notice that\nYou know that they're very skeptical right out of the gate of everything which is a pretty good place in in stating the obvious which we rarely hear from again state owned or certainly corporate owned media but we should we said all the time on on our program which is again\nYou know we will only know versions of the truth how many of you listening were inside that constantly right\nOr any time somebody in power says something you know it's a version of the truth is always remember that version of the truth\nSo hard because so many people you know it ... what do we just go through in this country everybody says I Believe or I don't believe\nIn the middle ground is I Believe but I don't agree I mean ... ... we've been saying this river just say look it's a version of the truth do we ever really know who's ever going to really know what happened ah with with Brett Kavanaugh and blogger for ...\nOzzie for mobile lousy for it and Brett Kavanaugh although you know that those those are the people that are you an eye on those that are always believe same thing with ... we ever really going to go no\nThe reason why it's important news is that we have to start to start saying look it's not a matter of what you believe or not you have to start with the ... with with from the premise of we're never going to know and then the next premise should be those that are in power\nWant to make sure that we don't know and that's how you have to look at people in power\nWhen they're doling out their version of the truth understand it's a version of the truth you don't be mad at him it doesn't make them necessarily bad\nThey're in power that's the point you ask yourself where are you on the food chain\nDo you tell your little children everything of course not you've got power over them so you tell them Allison do you do need to ask any more questions just teachers your vegetables and then we'll we'll talk later\nRight because you have power and when you're the kid you get frustrated and you want to act out but your lower on the food chain there's not a whole lot you can do you can change your condition and move yourself up\nBut most folks don't want to do that type of work instead they want to act out like a five year old the tragedy is of course is that they're forty five years old or fifty five years old or thirty five years old and then it just becomes flat out embarrassing\nBut that's more and more folks are these days they just act out they want to believe or they just want to act out because they feel like they've got nothing else to do it's like well what are you going to do about an act out wear pink cat\nWhy don't you improve your lot life that's another option but you know they don't want to do that 'cause that's hard\nAnd that's what they're talking about with all of this if you listen to what al Jazeera had to say\nThat's what they're talking about the media\nAgain version of the truth we know what NBL came out and said I'm a reformer women are going to be able to drive and then of course you know people that's all they want to do is they just want to push an agenda they owe ... if\nIf if he's for women driving then he's got to be a great guy it's like you need to ask another question which is there's a version of the truth he's going to reform why is he saying he's going to reform why is he after all these decades going to allow women\nTo drive in Saudi Arabia why is he saying that is because he wants women to drive or again is that a distraction is that a shiny object is that a missed direction\nYeah you have to ask those questions that doesn't mean anything is right but I understand where you are on the food chain and what amazes me is everybody thinks they're at the top of the food chain\nThat's what's hilarious everybody thinks they're the boss I'm the boss\nI drive an electric car ride drive a big four wheel truck I'm the boss it's like we can both be boss gives wonder if he's got a little electric car what have you got a big gas guzzling four wheel drive but you're both the boss\nAnd I'm a Democrat I'm boss Republican I'm above us okay All right fine you're both by how can you both be bought it just like when we cover all these stories retro be do the global media spotlight same story everybody having a different version and claiming that they've got all the facts\nIt doesn't make any sense\nThat we're moving to Europe in London specifically the LDC talk radio network Trump and taxes\nAnd what the Brits think about it so you'll remember over the summer Trump got his big visit wasn't quite the pomp and circumstance that he did like like for instance when Macron invited him to France but he got his visit to the United kingdom and uh he got to stay around he got ... got to meet the queen got do all of that\nAnd now of course the bill has been made public what does it cost to bring Donald Trump to the United kingdom\nAnd of course the scrutiny and this is healthy scrutiny why is the bill for Donald Trump so much higher than similar public events for instance like the royal wedding that's also just happened this past year\nAnd why was one so much more expensive than the other and why is it a public debate\nAnd the question that is being asked and you'll hear on all of this is it really just about Donald Trump is it about doing a fair job or is it about stoking animosity and creating crises or fake crises so that you can run up a bill\nAnd then later on say it's not us it's Donald Trump maybe you can decide here's how the Brits think about it on voice ...\nToday by the national police chief counsel tennis ... Donald Trump's visit to the United kingdom that full day trip back in July cost nearly Eighteen million pounds to place it's a big number but while it is a huge sum of money I mean just combat\nLists for example the recent royal wedding in wins a\nJew conducts the ... the big day I tell you the whole world looked past\nAnd the police and crime commission of for the times that he has he says ... said\nHe is the cost of that was somewhere between two and four million pounds of Eighteen million pounds when a big global row wedding costs a maximum of ... million pounds of police seems to be an astonishing sum of money are you happy\n... Eighteen million pounds of your heart and tax money\nTax money was spent on Donald Trump secure as the mayor who's a new quarter from black have good evening a welcome to the ...\nI don't pay my taxes they sold it to go to someone that\nTells us in London ... we do not like\nA you know appreciate 'til we don't even want to have nothing to do with him like his whole concept that they can they do anything in America don't\nCome to London and use that money because nobody likes you and I think that is a raging\nTold us ... someone like you\nCould put ... if we face played terrible middle treats rational nuclear threat hold some terrible danger or face the country it's Donald Trump in America who control the lion's share of NATO spending who will be that the defendants that's caught impulses ...\nAfter ... advice and hearing the SAT on the radio I call Carl so glad I did through Carlos guidance and using correct exercise movements I'm very happy to say that I'm back in the pool and pain free\nThat's really great news or there are so many people with different goals and different obstacles and what are you waiting for you can achieve your goal or overcome your obstacle by calling Carl now at six o two four zero two forty seven eighty or email him through his website longevity peachy dot com that's\nLongevity P.

on Arizona's new station PTA earning\nArizona's news station a\nThis is the Fullerton financial our which Seventy Fullerton and the retirements news networks mark Elliott Stephanie has the president and founder of bulletin financial planning and is one of the top one hundred business women in Arizona\nStephanie and her team believe in building lifelong relationships built on performance and trust this is the forwards and financial our bond the retirements used to work [noise]\nWelcome to the forwards and financial our were your retirement dreams began mark Kelly's with retirement news than working I'm here of course with Stephanie forwards and the president and founder of forwards and financial planning stuff and he started the company\nIn two thousand and four and we're going to be talking today about what happens if you live to the age of one hundred what are the odds that you might live to the age of one hundred and so we're gonna talk about longevity on the program today\nThat Stephanie you know your company that you started in two thousand for ... financial planning\nYou have to come up with a lot of different scenarios for your clients some may live two Seventy five somebody live to eighty five Ninety five one five\nI mean this is a longevity is really one of the biggest challenges you have probably been trying to help your clients come up with a strategy for their retirement\nAbsolutely egg I call it the longevity risk you know well your money last as long as you do it is a concern and it's something that you're right that we are addressing all the time with potential clients in her clients that come in to talk to us\nWe don't you think about this because we're talking today what happens if you live to the age of one hundred and there was recently an Italian woman named him Marino died peacefully in a rocking chair at the age of\nOne hundred and Seventeen so not only was she the world's oldest person but Emma also was the last known person to have been born in the Eighteen hundreds and you go back to the Nineteen twenties are like twenty three thousand centenarian so that's what it is that's where your call to be at the age one hundred\nThen you go fast forward and say Nineteen Ninety there's no over a hundred thousand centenarians you got a twenty Fifteen there's over four hundred thousand centenarians well they're projecting by the year two thousand fifty there'll be three point seven million centenarians that isn't\nThat crazy yeah\nSo the numbers are crazy and certainly what we're going to talk about today is what happens what if you actually live that long so Stephanie today is going to show your waist prepare financially for the growing possibility\nThat you just might hit that ripe old age of one hundred and you know Stephanie if you're fifty or sixty or Seventy still a hundred is a long ways off\nThat seems like that's that's kind of difficult to prepare for and maybe it's unbelievable that you're actually at the age of one hundred how can you how do you handle that because people say Stephanie come on I'm not gonna live that long\nYou're well he certainly can and you know plain and simple as you noted that adds\nA person will live and tell a hundred ... they are increasing people we are facing all kinds of risk over the course of a lifetime and let's think about it ... the risk of losing your your home are dying prematurely becoming disabled maybe you're unable to work you know\nBeing in a fender bender in your car and the list goes on and on and on for people heading toward retirement are already there living that long life sounds like a reward but it also presents a genuine risk and\nJanuary and risk and what we in the financial business call that Islam devotee risk meaning that you could live longer than your money will live as long as you will not last as long\nAs it was a good idea for people to look at insurance policies to protect themselves\nUm as a good idea for people to look at how to ensure that their money is not going to run out that it will live as long as they do in life\nYou know even if it means going to age one hundred\nSo what we're really talking about here is building\nYour own sort of long devotee insurance making sure that as long as you're living that you've got money to help offset that lifestyle because the fact is is we are living longer and that means\nI Want to look at probabilities I Want to know that there is a very strong probability that should you be one of those high percentage of people that are going to live past Ninety\nThat you were going to have enough\nMoney to last you out that retirement so you see you can see answering these questions it does take calculating it does take projecting it again it's not just as easy as it used to be and I was you know takes a lot of question first\nHow much will you neat so for a lot of people retirement amounts to the biggest purchase of their lifetime I mean this is huge for them and they cost easily two and a half times the cost of an average home so for example some figures that were release recently showed\nThat the average cost of retirement has risen\nTo seven hundred and thirty eight plus thousand dollars per couple\nOf course you know that figure is going to have very wild widely from person to person based on factors such as health lifestyle oh I had a couple in just recently were sitting down just this week talking to them and I was surprised because we were talking\nAbout what they need what was the projected income needs in retirement and they told me oh well we need about Seventy six thousand dollars a year that's what they were meeting\nAnd so I began to ask them because I'm thinking they must have a house payment they must have a car payment and then so tell me you know what's your house payment Nick oh well we we don't have a house payment\nI'm like oh do you have a car payment no we're debt free as your debt free and you're wanting Seventy six thousand dollars a year plus they say yeah we worked hard we\nWant to do some traveling so we want to look at what it is you know what kind of life salad as we want to know what it is that you want to do\nOn everybody's situation is different stuff and so you see people with a million dollars that really can't afford to retire\nBut you've also seen people with two hundred thousand dollars that can retire so there's a lot that goes into this uh and the so don't get caught up in hey I Need a million dollars that's not enough money to million or maybe you're you're one of those needs two hundred thousand or five hundred thousand it's all different because everybody's situation is different but knowing whatever number it is for you and your situation\nThe size of the asset based definitely needs to carry them through retirement and that would mean and projecting expenses I Would think\nYes ... you know um you're absolutely correct and I get so irritated are frustrated maybe it's a better word it you know when I hear these people just make these blanket statements you gotta have X amount of dollars to be able to retire I Want to\nAsk them what are they based on that on you know because mark I can tell you you probably spend your money differently than me would you agree\nI'm no because you play golf every day [laughter]\nNo I don't know the the ... you know what our listeners don't realize what an avid golfer you are\nIn fact you're pretty pretty good my understanding yes but I can tell you you probably spend a lot more money on golf than I Do let's also probably say that I probably spend more money on other things that you don't so\nMy guess is your wardrobe cost much more than mine\nHey [laughter] you know being that like in my personal expenses now right but that's exactly what we do we want to take a look at real mystic list of retirement\n... spent says we want to make sure that we're prepared for those unique
