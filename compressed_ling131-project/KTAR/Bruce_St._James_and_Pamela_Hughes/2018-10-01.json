[noise]\n\nArizona's news station K DARE news on Ninety two three of them Bruce St James and mental issues\nUm last week for seems like forever ago we were\nHearing about this um reopening overhearing where\nA judge Kavanaugh and one of his accusers ... to come forward and and what would it look like and how would it look in the Senate and then when you heard of a of a local talk of Maricopa County\nProsecutor a ritual Mitchell was going to do the questioning a sex crimes a sexual assault expert prosecutor here in my Ali and that she was being brought in\n'em and we thought ... well ... it's interesting and how was that gonna turn out [noise]\nYeah and if you watch the hearings on Thursday it was kind of a mixed bag I agree when it came to Christine Blasey Ford it appeared is though Rachel Mitchell\nSilk felt as though she was in a courtroom and some of the questions that she asks she was trying to lead Christine in a particular direction but she was taking a long time to get there\nShe she's on I'm I'm assuming used to having all the time she needs to lay out the credit and get to the question and and and tell a story in and she only had these five minute increments it's one of the first things I think we both noticed was this format you crave\nThe format was really strange for a prosecutor like that where you only have five minutes ask questions and then and then it goes to the defense and I was like yeah the exact opposite ... and so it was really awkward to watch I think the line of questioning at times was strange with us you wasted a lot of time but\nThis is what she does I mean she has about twenty five years experience as a career prosecutor\nOf you know sex related and other crimes right here in Arizona\nSo she questioned Christine Blasey Ford only got through a few questions with judge Kavanaugh before Lindsey Graham the old way off the wagon and Republican sucking into their own ... started seeing how bad they felt for cabin on how awesome that\nWas all said and done but now we're getting to see a five page memo\nThat Rachel Mitchell outlines for more than a half a dozen reasons why she thinks the testimony\nOf Christine Blasey Ford has some inconsistencies in fact in this five page\nMemo which I've got in front of me right here this is what I'm Rachel Mitchell again Arizona sex crimes prosecutor um wrote quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove but this case is even weaker than that\nDr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either refute her allegations or failed to corroborate them yeah and in Houston\nYeah I Am and here's the problem I had with her ... her mother didn't come across to me like a legal document as much as a political one and I was actually disappointed in that because\nI thought that she shouldn't ... this is the prosecutor was ritual\nThose who run into it we call [noise]\nArizona's home to many types of [noise]\nToo soon to tell me why this is bothering you may be crystal clear [noise]\nWhen you say ... when I hear the word hotshots I think of the the Granite Mountain potshots I think of you are now I think of Prescott a when hot shots is almost become\nI understand that there are hot shots and a hotshot crews and we have hotshot crews in Arizona and it is a specific um job you know these wildland firefighters that are on the front lines and and the training that goes into it and it's amazing when you say hot shots in Arizona I I think that we lost Nineteen firefighters\nYeah that's exactly what you think of you you think of the Yarnell hill fire and you think of the Nineteen Granite Mountain ... shots that died on that fire\nOr they are they I mean they couldn't have been oblivious to that when they came up with the name so they chose it knowing\nThat the term or the word hot shots holds especially if you're if you want to call them but the Minneapolis hot shots I don't think anybody would have a problem I think it's yeah we have hotshot crews all over the country\nHere we had such a tragedy that was that was real for so many people and so painful for her community I think it's a misstep by wishing you'll upon the team or this thing and I love football I think it's a misstep trying to target too closely to something that was some\nTragic here's the team president talking a little bit about the hot shot name for these guys are\nOut of the navy seals the firefighters are so over the coming months we will have to have and their support groups etcetera [noise] find ways to the most the most appropriate was yeah\nI think you should engage a prior to naming them so here's my question\nSo maybe this answers the question of why I'm uncomfortable\nIf there had not been the tragedy in your no if Nineteen Granite Mountain hotshot firefighters have died in that fire would they name that team potshots\nYou see what I'm saying if the turtle hot shot wasn't seared into\nOur memory for what happened up on the hill\nWould've even been in consideration for me and they'd have been the you know the side minders or the you know\nNo rent on or whatever you and I are are are are close to this I mean having gone up and in the wake of ah the Yarnell hill fire and and the one year anniversary afterwards\nAnd being in that community and just seeing\nHow much it impacted people's lives I mean it was a it was incredible it was tragic it was it was sad and it's still impacts really lay it dies um but we don't put on the equipment and go fight the fire in a community or on like as part of a wild land crew so I\nAsked firefighters out there right now you don't have to be part of the hot shots but just firefighters in general because it is a fraternity brother hide it it's a family now when you hear that the alliance of American football's new professional league here in Arizona is going to be called the hot shots\nDoes it does it bother you or are we making too much about it we want to hear from you on TALK today six so to two hundred two seven three three six so to two hundred two seven three three were not as close to it as you we would love to hear from firefighters about their thoughts about the Arizona hot\nShot I read a co sign on my theory now I hadn't been a tragedy will even yeah I\nAlways you on that it makes me uncomfortable as well and I think that that's why it was chosen and that's why I'm uncomfortable costs on\nCalifornia is losing its ever bleep in mind as we continue to try to run everyone's lives it's very late in the latest requirement but they're making of

I mean Senator Flake really for the Senate hand this energy to share his hand got McConnell on board knowing that if it went to the floor of the Senate they were not going to have the votes they needed to confirm him so forced the hand\nMcConnell then went to the president said you need to reopen it and the president reopened it Mm\nHe did allow the set it to guide things is that exactly what he's doing here as well it sounds kind of like it but I don't know how that plays out with an FBI investigation because there's really three\nBecause there's really three different paths\nThis could go moving forward one\nFBI investigators could find something anything who not to corroborate Christine blah say for sure okay ah I miss pictures and video in that case a Mitch McConnell could call the blossomed put the nomination on the floor and could potentially be embarrassed not having\nThe vote knock it if if the votes and not one to\nThat does anybody believe that Michael Jordan son is facing serious disadvantages by being an African American male who happens to be Michael Jordan\nI think he makes about much better argument that your socioeconomic status matters more than your skin pills\nAnd I think that that's the bigger agenda here I think that well Ralph would like to be able\nTo to get an advantage competing for like lucrative government contracts as a minority I think at the end of the day he has more of an agenda and agenda where he does he wants to get rid\nOf the minority business certification process and replace it with some sort of socioeconomic status which is not race\nBut it does bring up an interesting question and frankly one that I never thought of before right and that is like is there a percentage for which you are considered a minority Elizabeth Warren you might remember the president calls her Pocahontas\nSushi claim to be one Native American yes and percentage she's like one thirty second one thirty second what percentage is I Do not even getting ... I'm ... now yeah it was almost\nAs black or as as a Ralph\nExactly before and and and it got me thinking personally because my my husband is half Japanese okay and at five zero and my daughter is twenty five percent Japanese oh there were I just think\nThat like I don't I don't know I just it's just it's a strange way I like I never really she just this or she is I don't think of like minorities running along those lines and so\nWe asked you on the open Mike line six so to two hundred two seven three three is there a percentage for which ... you need to reach in order to be considered a minority and here's what you're saying across the valley\nThan from Peoria I don't know about other states in Oklahoma City which were quarter percent India and then you can qualify for rent a truck or one quarter and your parents had to be registered also\n... oh that's that is to be a part of any of these specific tribes and by the way there's ... there's money in that I see a big money on ...\nThey do things like there's there's profit sharing that comes from casinos and there's also a government stipend I Believe it's way overdue for for tribal members so they're singing at least in Oklahoma and I'm sure that I think there's a statute in Arizona you have to be a certain percentage\nSo there is a minimum amount of native but you have to be at least when it comes to the\nGym for minority would be one of the other one\nI've got to be half that touches opinion yeah fifty percent\nBut but but using that as a standard think about how many people wouldn't get preferences in college or in the hiring in the workplace is fifty was the students because there are people with a lot less than fifty if you did the DNA tests for you knew their their lineage\nBut they can still clinging to me and I don't\nWatch any minority and as we all start and is it a percentage looking going hey mom a seat you know we start mixing it all had ... I was going with that you know where were you know\nWe're we're going to start diluting the little bit here because there's some really was up it was fun to minority in this fascinating\nYeah [noise]

given her business ideas and everything on things you can do at home maybe but she really hasn't done anything and I'm not sure what to do\n... it's difficult to watch people you love misbehave\nWhen they're hurting when they're hurting she's hurting obviously what kind of job did she have before\nWell she worked at like a hospital she was a mental health technician\nMhm making what kind of money\nWell she's not the main um income in our household so she or her husband has a job yes my dad has a job when does seem a little while he makes and I think a hundred thousand dollars a year maybe\nOkay so she doesn't have a ... she didn't have to work to eat yeah okay so I mean what if she just didn't want to work\nWell ah I feel like for her type of spending that's the problem she likes to spend money mhm\nMhm and how old are you I'm Eighteen okay\nAll right well there's a rule that we have discovered in these types of conversations and it's called the powder ... syndrome once someone has powder dry but they don't really want your opinion about money or sex and so your mother is not going to take an Eighteen year olds input\nOn her spending habits you don't have standing you don't have credibility with her to have that discussion and that's what you're discovering my roam around at all\nKnow and it's just difficult now\nYou know when you're fifty eight and she's Ninety six or something yeah she may take your input those days right that's a different that's a different parent child relationship than an Eighteen to whatever and so\nYou know you have to build some credibility so the only thing I Would tell you that there was a couple of things um one is I Would not bring up her spending again unless she brings it up\nOK okay too I Would tell her lots of stories about the times that you used to mess up mom I used to spend them do this and I used to do this and may and when I got on this budget I got on this humble of system I got on this plan to get out of debt I Am doing so good and you just tell your story\nBecause your ego where he is not condemning her\nIt's just lose just holding up the idea that there's hope right now to tell your story and talk about how you're winning doing these things and that changes everything for you then the second thing you can do is is is there anyone like maybe your dad\nAnd who could sit down and talk with her and the two of them actually start getting their act together\nWell I'm actually a guess my dad has talked to her he's actually one of the people that they should call and we don't watch your show\nMhm okay well this was his job not yours is what I'm saying and sunny a this would be like a husband now calling now that's a little different standing and he puts his arm around his wife and says look\nWe got a problem here you're spending like you're in Congress I mean we got to stop this there's a problem here\nAnd when you sit down and work through this issue together and we've got to put together some kind of a plan where we have a good life\nAnd we have a good life meaning we spend some money now and we invest and save so that we have you know we live like no one else so later we can live like no one else but really this is on your dad to do this is not on you you wrote because he's got standing he's got to a position in the household to have a discussion\nWhere as an Eighteen year old you don't and um it's not just you obviously are very sharp and you can do all kinds of things for you I'm not saying you're not good or you're not whole or whatever I'm just saying in your mom's eyes you're still that little baby she used a diaper\nAnd it's just hard for her to take advice from you but now her husband that's a different thing and um you know he\nCan sit down and if it was a mile from the Chernobyl just sit than we do have a discussion going this is this is something we're not doing here and there's a problem and we've got to work through this and so he's put up with is a long\nTime and it's time for him to deal with it now that that's what I'm saying hey thank you for the call open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five [noise]\nYou want to know what
