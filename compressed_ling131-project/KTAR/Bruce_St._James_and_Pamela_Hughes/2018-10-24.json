we are following the developing story that started earlier this morning with explosive devices starting\nTo pop up at a variety of locations around the country right so what we have right now is the secret service intercepted to package as one was meant for the Clintons in New York the other men for the Obama is in DC they never got anywhere near the residents\nThey have a whole procedure in place it prevents you the mail from getting anywhere near\nSo that's where we started the morning and then it quickly developed because the studios of CNN were evacuated live on the air being too\nReceived a package now that package while it was set to CNN it was meant for former CIA director John Brennan that is who it was addressed to God I feel like in in ... kind of thing\nNow we've seen a picture of the package itself CNN tweeted out a picture of the device and the think of a padded envelope do you know what I'm saying you've seen these padded envelopes maybe you get something in that it came in the return address on the padded emblem the return address on\nSo you see me padded envelopes maybe you get something in that it came in the return address on the padded emblem the return address on the padded envy huge letters is Debbie Wasserman Schultz an eighth floor to address when I'm going assumes or officer or whatever in Florida so\nThat Wasserman Schultz office in Miami how bad evacuated earlier this morning okay and we were sitting here going okay well she got one of the package it she was one of the targets right that we find out no she wasn't you know\nThat whoever is sending these packages addressed one two former attorney general Eric Holder here's the thing though Bruce ready they use the wrong address okay so it got\nReturned to sender it got sent back to Debbie Wasserman Schultz hence the reason why they evacuated her\nOffice and folks\nShe's not the one sending me but wait there's more oh okay well now it is unclear at this point if any of these packages were delivered by us meal UPS or feather what do you mean\nCNN we well we know the the the the the explosive device or the device because again it's unclear to me if they are actual explosives or dumped okay I got information on that we'll get to that and that device delivered to George Soros says house Monday was delivered by hand not by mail\nHe was the first Monday in his mailbox CNN is now reporting that the device but they got in their mail room did not come through the mail it was delivered via a courier\nOkay that leaves the question though for the two that were delivered to the former presidents because I don't know the I I don't know the answer to that but what I Do now is we're now getting reports that those two devices okay one that was sent\nTo former President Obama and former President Clinton ... we're being told that they were in fact\nLived divisive okay so they were explosives or have the ability to explode and impossibly killer harm [noise]\nWe're [laughter] it's a fast moving story books were also finding out that CNN now reporting that Maxine Waters got a package as well yeah\nSo Obama I can tell you the Schumer and Pelosi will be getting one Obama Clinton holder ...

both for one case anything you can just loaded up\nThat's the way they're going to keep the government's hands off as much of it as we can let it grow\nWithout tax or grow tax deferred whatever you're doing it all the matches everything you can just completely max all that out and then that's what we're doing and then the only thing left to do is just start investing and then you decide what you're going to invest in with the one Seventy five I buy two things\nAnd so I I'm pretty comfortable with that I have found that wealthy people generally find something that they understand and they like and that's what they invest in they don't do\nSuper crazy sophisticated we're double back flip investments\nThey just do something that they understand and they do it the typical millionaire in other words becomes a millionaire and their four one K. is and what they're paid for house and then they have other investments and they buy stuff that that you know they have a small business or they have whatever so what I Would tell you is I buy real estate that I paid cash for\nAs an investment a rental real estate and I invested in good growth stocks mutual funds in just straight into the stock

especially paid for real estate it's very very nice I got a bunch of it [laughter] but if you don't want to do with all that and I just get I Would pick some good mutual funds and go that way\nBut at the point is there is no shame and your game by keeping it simple\n\nSomehow people have the idea that primitive or simple is bad\nAnd the contrary to the contrary it it the truth is the contrary to

trying to get a little bit of advice and how to advise my parents to get long term care insurance\nMy daddy it's sixty seven and doesn't qualify hands and health issues for my mom just turned sixty a couple of months ago and the last couple of months ago and we're talking and my dad says well\nNo amount for the insurance doesn't fit in our budget and with my mom says that short term thinking mhm and I think they need at the budget what's their income [noise] um [noise] well that's\nA good question they are retired missionary so they have not made a town and my dad tomorrow retire to my mom works at the receptionist I don't know exactly what\nThey're getting my outfit in their budget okay I mean there may have to\nBuy very very limited policy if they don't have hardly any income why what's wrong with your dad that he doesn't qualify\n[noise] um he has made us have had a kidney transplant\nAnd so he's attempting to get it in the past and hasn't been able to\nTell them I tried to do what you said the Potter about sending them off her or whatever you know say you know what works for me to try to stay out of ...\nReally he doesn't get to go for not get too much into that gave out fake parent Lee I'm like last year I encourage them to look into it and they talked about al\n... I think he didn't qualify at that point so\nSo if you if you can't talk about this what are they going to do it or not I mean how can I help\nOut my mom called me and told me all day so I think she's on board of trying I guess my question is um\n[noise] how can I have had to convince them that it's an important [laughter] you know like\nYour mom already knows it's important not only question is I don't know if they've got the money to buy much of a policy sounds like they're pretty broke to me um with what you're describing I don't know I mean some people come off of mission field not broke but but sometimes\nUm what what you're describing I don't know I mean some people come off of mission field not broke but but sometimes I don't and so you just got to you know um it it sounds like you're trying to fix something a lot harder and they're trying to fix it you can't make them do this\nAnd so I think you can enter your mom's question and the yeah I mean if there's any way I could get it into my budget I Would get it into my budget um but it sounds like his health is he's an older than her about Fifteen Years and he's\nAre no I'm Sorry about seven years you're saying but I'm
