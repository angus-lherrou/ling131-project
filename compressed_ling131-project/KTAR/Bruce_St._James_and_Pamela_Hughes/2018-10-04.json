T. A. R. news [noise]\nArizona's news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three of them Bruce St James and animal issues [noise]\nYou know we're paying attention to a couple of uh some tight maybe not so tight races here in the state of Arizona as voters getting ready to head to the polls in just about one month family we have a gym or we have a midterm election in ... almost exactly one yeah\nAnd there are some major races that are going on here in Arizona that Arizona have an eye on but\nThe national stage is keeping a close eye on it as well take a look at what's happening in the Senate race in Arizona this is for the seat that Senator Flake is resigning vacating and so now you've got to make Sally for the ... and you've got here since then I'm up for the Democrats\nThere's been a considerable amount of polling that has been done thus far on this race because of\nThe national implications as well that implication would be Democrats believe they have a real shot\nOf taking a Republican seat currently held by flake and turning at democratic\nSo he's got a new poll out right now and it is I'm from Suffolk University and it's also with the Arizona Republic and it shows that here since ... the Democrat in that race\nHas an edge over the Republican Martha ... now that edge is still within the margin of error you've got here since ... that is leading with forty four percent of likely voters\nTo Martha ... forty one percent margin of error four percent so it's within that but I think here's the bigger um take away from this survey burst nearly eleven percent of voters\nSay they're still unsure who they will vote for which means there is a lot of room for both cinema and to make Sally to grow some support\n... yeah it is far from done I think might be a nice way to put it you know one of the things I noticed though in this\nUh this new poll that came out was that it also took a look at the gubernatorial I Do that only for joining us because we're the only people use the term given the governor's audience of on okay a similar so Jamie I use the term agreement to a vet the race for governor isn't\nAs close a reason I bring that up is we hear a lot about people voting party line vote all ours I vote are all these ... these numbers are quite different from a a congresswoman cinemas support or polling numbers in the same poll so I'm comparing apples to apples you see what I'm saying\nIs much higher than David Garcia's against a doozy so if people are voting party line they're not when it comes to the difference between Senate and governor when it comes from Sam\nIt comes to the governor's race you've got the income that the Republican governor right now doesn't do see has a fifty percent it's a commanding lead over\nA commanding lead over the Democratic challenger David Garcia he's coming in with thirty eight percent so twelve point difference right there compared to a three point ... right and the Senate race so what's different\nThe toys R Us to survive and doing tours Russell's like second only to Disneyland you know like I mean it was a day of fun and for ... running up and down the aisles playing with things getting in trouble having moms scream at me that was why we went to Toys R us\nBut even I could have knowledge and I've been visiting a lot of Toys R us is lately but you know\nAs the parent in the room I haven't either I I understand why you hadn't been\nRevisiting a lot of those um but but I Am creep factor yeah exactly that's I was trying to help you out there I have a nine year old\nDaughter and and and not our ally um when when Riley looks at her birthday like all your birthday is coming up what you want for your birthday she was going on Amazon\nAnd she'll those types of things in the Amazon she kinda like searches through there we don't go to toys are us to develop a Christmas list or a birthday Lester things along those lines it's all done on line and that really is hurt toys R. us and so when they say\nThat they're exploring you know potential partners to develop new idea is that could bring back these iconic brands and a new re imagined way that some fantastic but there really was a new re imagined way to bring them back when you've already done that well they were still storefront or are they trying\nTo play off of the emotion that we've taken away from you\nAnd if we bring it back people get really excited they are going to stand in line outside of the toys R Us is a kind of one of those you won't where you can have and that's what they're tapping into right now could remember Coca Cola did and they took away coca give us new coke and then they brought back old coke knew nobody knew don't ever talk about new ... ... but if you have to what you're saying they took it away\nI

moving forward we believe tomorrow possibly a vote in the full Senate this weekend but can we acknowledge that the fight over Brett Kavanaugh\nIs more than just a Supreme Court seat it oh yeah it has become and by the way for different people it's become a different by writing for some people it's the fight about sexual harassment and women being treated mistreated inappropriately by Mitt Romney yeah\nI'm ... and to me that's still what it is a but for others it is about getting a justice on the court that could potentially be a vote for overturning roe v Wade\nFor some people it is a example of men being unfairly accused by women who lie and make things up to destroy their lives\nSo there's a lot of different political facets that are at play here and I think that they're all converging right now Bruce to make what is going to be I think a monstrous turnout for mid term elections here and just about a month\nWell and I think it's pretty amazing how fast it changed because you certainly could make the argument than when\nMiss for Dr Ford king for that the tide was turning against Kavanaugh and against the ours because they were in the position of having to call her a liar and they didn't want to do that they were in the position of defending a guy that they don't know exactly what happened back thirty six years ago\nBut she was especially after testimony\nUm she came across a reluctant she came across sincere she came across emotional and that it would be difficult to attack her well that didn't last long\nDidn't last long because soon after she spoke a week ago you had judge Kavanaugh who sat down and that very same seat and that very same hall and talk to the very same senators and a very different\nTone a miss Ford was I'm nervous and a accommodating you had judge Kavanaugh who was defensive argumentative and\nAnd that tactic because that's what it was it was a strategic it wasn't just ... ... on they were sitting in the acrimony but a lot for but a lot of Republicans see those signs and his defiant testimony\nAs bringing the GOP together there was a there was a base that was a little bit apathetic\nI'm ... and getting defeated correct thinking that this blue wave that you know the media talked so much about that the Democrats are going to take over the house and then they're going to have even being you know in limbo and things along those lines you got conservatives that are out cheering that the trunk like performance that you\nYou had from judge Kavanaugh and that is kind of really rallied that grew\nWell and do and there's evidence
