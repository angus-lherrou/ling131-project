three of them Bruce St James and analysts you\nSaid there are some numbers and statistics out there that we should share according to the U.S census thirty two percent\nOf American adults have a bachelor's degree by the way that is the largest percentage ever in our nature of the nation's history a third white now Nineteen million Americans are enrolled in an undergraduate college program and of course you every year millions more joined the ranks\nSo looking at colleges and how people choose colleges is a a whole industry into itself right Pamela there's publications er visits all this stuff right\nBut what if I told you what what if I told you that the fastest growing college and University in the United states\nIs smack dab in the middle of the valley you would say wow\nWhat school is it is I ask you I was going to say as being a W goes hello yeah do I look at the number\nOf grills rewrite yeah I Would you would be wrong that is because literally the top one hundred colleges and universities\n... based on growth on five years if you're ... number one on the list Grand Canyon universe\nDC you over the last five years has seen an increase in the applications that three hundred and Seventy five percent\nWow it growing and growing fast and you can see that if any have you driven past the camp is if you drove past five years ago when he was a couple of buildings are you Dr ... what\nThe heck is going on here right it is just absolutely exploded yet it is now the fast\nIs well I guess you'd say growing university where you had the applications that are rising and that's pretty phenomenal feet Bruce when you consider that there are thousands upon thousands of four year institutions if you're looking at public and private and\nSmall and large in urban and rural and nonprofit\nAnd for profit there are so many different schools to choose from yeah what is Grand Canyon doing that is lending itself to seeing a three hundred and Seventy five percent increase in five years\nAnd but the numbers themselves so we talk about the percentage current undergraduate enrollment is forty nine thousand five hundred students forty nine thousand five hundred so you say well I mean\nYou know is is a bigger or not you know compared to what\nI Want to give you some names of other schools but you've heard of University of Kansas\nRight near the university and has Nineteen thousand total undergrads or write your ear to the University of Utah right use about twenty four thousand\nBoston University BU Eighteen thousand users growing but it's becoming one of the larger universities in the country and when you also consider\nThat's nationwide shouldn't wide I have a lot of friends and and and a visit California law and I don't understand how anybody can buy a home in California like anything that's why a lot of them are moving he's like a one bedroom for hundreds on her feet um it's a bit of a fixer upper but at one point three million\nFlush [laughter]\nOur first started driving a darn thing around park on Walmart parking lot to be brought bought them like good there's a lot of tech okay so that that's\nKelly here in the family it still is cheaper to buy than to rent yeah that is starting to\nChange though and it may not stay like this for a long we are still one of those\nThose markets that has the median home price up to twenty five ... ...\nWhen you take a look at the three bedroom fair market rent is about Fifteen hundred dollars a month okay\nSo you know you buy a home you're going to see a jumping appreciation over the last year or so and it's still a good deal to to own in the valley versus renting\nBut as you see home prices\nYou can even go up the appreciation is on the rise what\nElse is on the rise mortgage rates are on the\n... at some point that slows down right I mean this is just simple math\nI'm assuming of which are horrific up um I didn't graduate universe and rarely attended a vet there is a there is a tipping point for a lot of people\nRight in the valley still making sense buying them better than renting but I can make knowledge that there's probably a time when there is if you don't have to go back that far too when the bottom fell out of the market around here and those of us around no exactly what that whole thing felt like oh my ... had\n'em and the fundamental changes it had in the valleys upon me but I Know people\nAnd I want to raise my hand right now so I'm not one of them cause I'm not merely smart enough to do this but I met people who said oh yeah I sold my house six months before you know bottom fell out and I took that money and put in the bank I rented for two years then I went back and basically bought the same house for about half of what I sold it for it I'm like how\nCan they go are smart well that's obviously why well you talked about that the changing economy and how it even changed the landscape\nOf the valley think how many piling out Maricopa I still have ... men were why do you live there were buying homes there because that's all that they could afford because everything else closer forty five minutes outside of town had gone through the roof to get a four bedroom house or have a pool or have a yard because they couldn't afford to live\nIn the ... and I had a friend who had done the same thing and then ultimately had to walk away from the property people out and saying than doing the same thing from him so it's not even in Maricopa County things change we're still at a point where buying as a better option than renting in the valley you were one of those fewer markets and it could be changing here soon but\nA little different than the rest of the country and I like\nTo say the least so\nWe spent the uh yesterday Pamela

are piles bare knuckle approach to law enforcement had not granted him a pardon\nNo is it a bit terse are being facetious\n[laughter] like you know there's a little bit of they're making fun of them for losing yeah but I I'm looking at that going um\nWhat what's not true about that you might not like there were tire rising immigrants but if you go to the immigrant community those were the words that that were being used when I Would go out to Guadalupe drove the SP ten Seventy times or when there were there were round ups and\nYou're never more than Fifteen minutes away from today's some stories on Arizona's new station gates your news [noise]\nBruce St James and Pamela Hughes\nYou could make an argument that it is teaching commonsense or maybe the common sense it isn't being taught in high schools in the state of Texas they now require require as a condition of getting your diploma\nBut you go through um colon instructional videos on how to interact properly with law enforcement\nYet during a traffic stop mhm you get pulled over well behind the wheel how should you be have\nThat's part of the video it's poorly acted but the point that it is decidedly part of how like good now trying to get across though I think it's a good one and I run it through the filter of nobody ever taught me how to act when a police officer pulled me over it's not a thing I get nervous I honestly still to this day I get nervous my hand table to heart of me\nSo we ask do you want to open Mike line what do you think about this I think it's good I think it's something that yes I probably should have learned from my parents but they didn't think to teach it to me they did the best they could with what they had and they didn't think about it and I then maybe it wasn't big enough concern right exactly\nI think that you know I've learned a lot just being in the news business and covering stories on what to do and what not to do but we wanted to get your thoughts you liked it too didn't Uber's video idea I like the concept of it yeah okay but does everybody except to two hundred two seven three three that's what you're saying across the valley on our open Nightline\nApplaud Texas particularly in this year 'cause I had a partner in high school or during her stomach she was gunned down by six story because her her boyfriend move around trying to get a registration insurance out of the car\nAnd he couldn't tell what was going on or ... or so or blood pressure technician and try to\nListen to some of the some of the onus is on police officers to not shoot unarmed innocent people don't get me wrong I'm not doing absolve him back and I'll be as critical as critics critics can be when it comes to\nPolice behaving badly but but I think Texas acknowledges as the person being pulled over there you have a responsibility as well and there's things you can do to mitigate the chance of a bad outcome\nYeah and I talk about putting my hands on the steering wheel you know your hands where you can see them kind of right and if it's nighttime you know I turned on my don't light so they can see what's going on in my car\nWhen the officer asked for the license in registration say okay I'm going to reach into my purse or the glove compartment or something along those lines can catering because\nWell I just throw all the news that I've covered feel like that's the right thing to do what do you think across the valley\nWilliam and this is ridiculous okay we should be afraid of the cops rolled out our windows or not I don't like because they're pulling us over that is ridiculous we should not have to fear of college\nI don't disagree with that as a concept here's the problem if you're being pulled over by the\nPolice there is a suspicion that you may have committed some crime speeding ran through a red light we're talking about traffic stops so\nIt's not that you have to fear them but they're pulling you over and\nIf it's ... they're legally allowed to do that what can you do to try and why wouldn't you want to prevent a bad thing I tell you roll down your tinted windows\nIf you have a gun in the vehicle first thing he told the officers officer I have a weapon in the car\nDon't want them them pick it out in the corner of and I and you didn't see something that makes cops\nNervous at least that's what my friends don't me [noise]\nBe clear deliberate [noise]\nWe hear the stories on the time we saw officers going up the cars and people just having a shooting in with them may have to assume the worst\nBut

they're going to let them after you've had one student loans are not bankrupt the ball and they're going to come find you it's just sitting are piling up we need to find it but you don't have a single piece of information on this long\n[laughter] so my husband's not very organized I'm I'm I'm much more organized and I come here are financial on hill I guess on my phone and resold and I'm trying to track because it was a private June alone chase 'em so\nSo you know was it might not have the ... race account number\n[noise] probably somewhere I'm\nGenerally I guess that's the first place you would start called trade with that account number and say I know this was ... can you tell me who sold to I can tell you than you think it was sold again all those people when you go I Know this was so can you tell me how it was sold to until they finally say well no we own it\nAnd so forth now is this the Sallie Mae loan or a private loan\nAnd this is a pie that mountain it's not a Sallie Mae is not government to ensure\nNo you're sure\nYeah then why didn't they get bankrupted with the bankruptcy\nThat's what I'm thinking may have happened but it's not only\nDid Alan ... it's not a matter of it's not up to the lender as to whether they go bankrupt as up to you and your attorney\nSo your chapter seven should call it you should have had a matrix for your deaths due to a chapter seven yeah OK should ever had a matrix\nFor your debts and lifted all your desk for the best of you know I mean even if you didn't list a debt it can still be bankrupted did they not put anything down for this long at all it\nDid it on I mean credit it as a student loan and we were under the impression driver attorney that it you know what matter whether we put it down or not I mean we start getting crud everything that I'm\nOkay how does it matter if you're attorney thought it was a Sallie Mae your attorney was telling you that Sallie Mae's or not bankrupt ... that survives the bankruptcy if it's a private loan it's just like a personal line of credit is what it is and it completely was bankrupted\nOkay so do you put down chase student loans some amount on your matrix yeah I'm not worried about it it was a banker right it was bankrupted mass your bankruptcy was discharged yeah\nOK than if someone comes up you go and says we you owe us the student loan you say no that was bankrupted I'm just I'm not originally chase and that was what was left on the bankruptcy matrix and nobody can find you people but you know it's clear it should be clear it I don't know why your attorney would think that's not bankrupted I think they must have thought it was a Sallie Mae loan\nPossibly I mean like I said my husband's not very organized by on I mean we did say it was a private loan I Know that\nI don't know a ... a a private student loan is basically an secured long it's just the one that was used for college okay you just use like a person a lot of credit for college is the same thing\nA government insured Sallie Mae alone is not bankrupt ... a lot of credit is bankrupt or what you see the difference\nYeah I mean we have plenty of their way up hunting and Sally ... to pass\nKnow Sally Sally survive ... she's a resume how broad and so as you just can't get rid of her until you pay are often Victor\nBut the other stuff that is what you're facing I wouldn't worry about that right now

developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter]\nBut that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed [laughter] at the same level and you know so it it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still\nIs football skills are are the best on the planet\nI'm and his physical acumen his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body and MIT error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nIt but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed a ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids and they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nEven a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ... and so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight and you get a success level\nAnd your skill this world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that is true with the\nYou know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business yeah\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when in America knows you know gee for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be in this league mhm um and the most\nMoney these kids were make will be within their first three to five years of the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I I told them like ... you have to get focused but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen year old getting you know the ... to ... get into graduate survival guide a book and also taking our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what these old

emergency fund the stuff we talk about her every day on the air it it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty uh uh\nElastic in their spirits in that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer on our spirit and we don't receive is quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right\nRight and they're not like all docked in and go now to argue with you about ... ... ... it's a it's easier

fourteen year old when you're able to sit and talk to them they're just ready to go what is it we need to do to when\nYou have to end Dave you and I was talking about this as smart conference me when Hogan I was reading an article they're saying that this younger generation team to millennials are not entrepreneur and I'm like man that's that's a bunch of bologna the ...\nOr again the generator wrote that stupid [laughter]\nAnd so I get excited because I'm seeing this younger generation they are making stupid mistakes because no one never taught them once they learn\nThey tend to not make that same mistake in an area of the finances but they have to be taught it first\nSo that's what I Love about what we're doing is we're giving them life skills to business skills through the teen entrepreneur tool box kid we're helping them understand how to deal with their finances and how to make the right decision earlier on with our middle school curriculum with the graduate survival guide\nAnd when I see these young people come up to me saying that I cannot do and it thank you so much for teaching me earlier on\nBecause we make learning about money Dave and our organization where
