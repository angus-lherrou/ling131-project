they were born us regardless of physical changes or how they choose to be identified\nSo what you got right now is the department is arguing that agencies need to adopt this uniform definition of gender like a legal definition that everyone agrees on and they're saying on biological basis that it's clear grounded in science objective and\nThat would be either a male or female it's an

form that there are turned off maybe by this process here something kind of interesting\nWhen you take a look at two thousand and sixteen okay two thousand and six teams the presidential election in the state of Arizona forty\nPercent of those between the ages of Eighteen to twenty four voted Seventy two percent of those older than sixty five food\nIf those numbers the the same your election results will be remarkably the saying\nYes here in Arizona that will exactly be the case but nationwide we are starting to see a bit of a change when it comes to the mid term election two weeks from today folks and I know you can mail in your ballot and some of you are doing that right now\nWe're we're in the ... this was the election right now they frankly you got it on your kitchen counter spread out yeah\nSo Wall Street journal is doing a survey and what they found right now is nearly two thirds of registered voters having a high level of interest and this mid term election\nThat is the highest they have ever gotten for a mid term election people are engaged and when you're looking at who is engaged the most\nRight now sixty percent of Republican voters are compared to Seventy two percent of Democrats\nNow that's interesting because in midterms typically Republicans will go out and vote more often than dams it's just what's happened here is the numbers are where they are what we're seeing now the Dems are coming out like Republicans have come out historically\nYet given all of those odds people play the lottery every day as fashion when when it gets as big as one point six billion dollars so how much do we spend on\nAmerican foreign sound Seventy million dollars a year on lottery tickets more than two hundred dollars for every man woman and child in the U.S and more than we spend on books music movies sporting events and video games combined\nSo the lottery has figured out that there is a tipping point there's a number where you say you walk by and then there's another number like up on the digital billboards Rio I got to play\nThey know this so the lottery has been jogging the numbers working the odds so that these jackpots get hired knowing\nFifty million like fifty million what would I Do with that I wouldn't get out of bed for fifty million five hundred million ooh now I'll play\nWell I mean a spike in the making millions comes from the the ticket went from one to two dollars right so they they doubled the right off the bat right\nAnd then after a jackpot is had it resets the forty million instead of Fifteen million so it's easier to build it up but yet ... to win but using the segment Bruce talking about\nHow many people are going to go out and buy a ticket or maybe have already had that taken in their possession okay\nBuying your second or third for this this round now how many people are going to vote in two weeks from now which one will make a difference in your life so super producers TV nobody has a suggestion ready\nWhat if what if you were required to vote in order to play the lottery [laughter] now granted like eleven months out of the year that doesn't work because you're not eligible to vote in\nIn order to play the lottery [laughter] no granted like eleven months out of the year that doesn't work because you're not eligible to vote in January ... but in November specifically or even in primaries what if you were required to vote in order to get your lottery took an interesting concept BBC's guy going to have to think about it more\nBut it just goes to show where our priorities are well our priorities\nAll about the one in three hundred million chance of becoming a billionaire which is after taxes\nSo to half a billion again I'm not getting out of bed\nAnd something that is going to happen whether or not you engage in the process of going to be elected in two weeks you count the ballot how come you\nCan't make it cooler to vote than it is to buy Powerball pick or mega millions tickets\nYou you know I mean think of it like that I'm\nGetting the odds are astronomical and and all the studies out there have shown\nThat the people that play lotteries the most are the ones who can least afford it and that's why it's not a joke to call it a tax on the poor it it has been a tax on the poor because for many it is very old they believe their absolute only hope of changing their financial situation\nListen if you are buying a ticket and the buying those tickets means you're going with out something else you're going without food medication you're going to struggle to pay this bill or that bill then you shouldn't be buying a lottery ticket if you've all your money goes for cigarettes and lottery tickets\nNow on the other hand if you just want to engage in what's happening right now from like the pop culture phenomenon which is a mega millions and the largest lottery ever in history and ... and do engage in that is two dollars for entertainment\nI don't have a problem with that and if I could then well some do [noise]\n...

the amount of money you're going to save in one year is not going to change this\nYear in the process of getting out of debt this year still so um that does answer my question then your target is going to be in state schools to their number one cost or the number one mistake people make with college is college choice\nThey sign up for a school that free contain afford and they come out with a hundred thousand dollars worth of debt because they went someplace they shouldn't have gone\nYet my car you can't afford it's the same thing is ... better than a Chevrolet probably love Chevrolet you know all of them are probably better is it more expensive yes three four times more\nYou know same thing so can you get a Chevrolet education and be fine out here yeah most of us function on that we didn't go to ... schools that were a hundred grand a year your kids aren't going to either unless you're going to run them deeply in debt which I wouldn't recommend so we show you call you know your local\nIn state tuition schools that you think your kids might go to and you find out how much it is\nAnd we have we've gotten a pretty good start on that we have a great program here in Iowa that are high school kids are able to take college courses for free mhm and a lot of are a lot of the kids graduate with not only to high school diploma but also they're two year degree at our local community college\nWe army [noise] highly advising children could do that and a lot of that out of the fact that they're already doing that and taking college classes yeah and I'm going to a man in college you said community college is free\nWell if you are taking classes while you're in high school guy yeah cool yeah well the other thing you can do is\nIf you don't do that and you graduate from high school you still can go to community college about a third the cost of the typical in state college four year college\nAnd not here for two years if you don't have your first few years of stuff studies out a way because most of that's just core stuff anyway and you just make sure that that community college will transfer full credit into you know I'm I don't know University of Iowa or wherever it is are going to go right\nAnd our our state or whatever it is you just look at that and you lay it out and you say this is where we are going to go this is what it's going to cost and then you back into your budgets on it and go okay Seventeen year old we're going to be casual and so college choice is your biggest variable in a kid going to college\nDebt free variable number two is they make their part time job filling out for scholarships yeah jump\nOn learning ... suddenly filling out scholarship money and um you know we're we're meeting parents and kids who were\nYou know that they're they're getting two hundred and fifty twelve hundred and fifty twenty two hundred and fifty dollars scholarships and add them all up in a pile and they turned out to be thirty grand and they pay for school not a bad part time job when you're Seventeen\nAnd you work your butt off filling out like a Brazilian of those things not ten but hundreds\nOf scholarship applications and you try to get the third thing is you take a class on how to take the ACT not just take the ACT or SAT depending on which ... which applies to your particular situation and get your scores up\nBecause ... that a little bit of tutoring or a class on how to take that test will jump your scores substantially\nWith the typical kid and that qualifies you for yet more stuff and then the last one is juniors going to be
