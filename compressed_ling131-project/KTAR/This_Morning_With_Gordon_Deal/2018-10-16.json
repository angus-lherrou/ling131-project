Arizona and not talk about the border and they did Martha ... talk about the border but they talked about a lot of things and joining us this morning to\nTell us how it played out in DC is our D.C insider an ABC News political analysts are Alex costs the ... uh Alex um is there a sense there in Washington I notice it ran on CSPAN or is there a sense there in Washington is who won this debate and the people care obviously because this might change the balance of power in the Senate\nOh absolutely Washington pairs because yes this this may be whether Republicans not\nOnly keep the Senate but whether they add a Senate seat they need to hang onto the Jeff Flake sheet to expand their margin and\nIf anybody I said jump ball last night may be slight edge to mix Sally\nBecause she brought new information to the campaign and only new information changes things what was that the trees are in charge that the the Hollywood cinema headset it was okay to join the Taliban\nThat say showstopper and they may have little impact on the election\nOr for those who by the way did not hear this all earlier we played this this is from a two thousand three Internet radio interview here since I'm a being interviewed\nAs an individual if I Want to go fight in the Taliban army I go over there and I you know I'm I'm fighting for the heart of a personal decision and I I Want to\nGo ahead she says oh which is not exactly the endorsement to go you know go fight for the Taliban but it's not a not saying hey no you can't do that either is it hours\nThat's exactly right and in a state that Donald Trump only carried by three points to make this about\nNot about Trump not about your usual Democrat versus Republican back and forth but to make this will put the spotlight squarely on cinema on this is is probably not what she wants going into the election\nThese debates are the Roman Colosseum or these debates are we we put our gladiators in the coliseum to see what we know you're going to be faced with issues we can't even imagine what year the U.S Senate\nWho are you what strength of character do you have how do you react under pressure and should um other than really put this one way or she didn't have a good answer for this so it may give mix Sally a slight edge\nYou know a little different than the how the coliseum fights ended a they were both a gladiator and lie and you know try to yeah yeah usually\nA smart to bet on the line GE\nYeah no kidding and that's it's kind of what ... been running or oh campaign on yes I look I was the first female fighter pilot in combat

pointing to send them on saying here's why you don't want this gal\nThat's right and and her campaign that challenge campaign has been about strength in another shirt in the world where there's so much turbulence and chaos you want a strong\nSteady leadership a steady strong hand at the Taylor and mix Sally campaign as saying look cinema used to be something very different than she's pretending to be now\nYou can't count on that there's no shortage will be there it gives mix Sally in my view a slight edge but look it's a jump ball trumped state so it's going to be close\nAll right thanks a
