the show for truth seekers who are fed up with outdated financial advice I'm John Higgins in a reformed broker and it's my goal to reaffirm what you know to be true and to challenge the advice\nYou may have been told is true and if you're listening on one of our five Phoenix affiliates this morning hope you have a fantastic weekend you know as I like to say they're really two phases in life related to our money and phase one we worked for a money but in face to\nWe need our money to work for us but I mean at least that's how it's supposed to work\nAnd you use it every week my objective on this show is in a world where I recognize your consuming information at warp speed you're getting it on your watches\nFor goodness sakes it's more difficult now than ever before to actually make sense of what's out there if you've ever felt like you've gotten information overload you're not alone and my objective and goal is that each and every week\nThis one hour provides you an opportunity to gain clarity around your money so that you can make prudent smart decisions with what you've worked your lifetime to save and today I'm Talking about something that I think maybe one of the most important components to success long term with your money\nAnd it's going to sound very trite it's going to sound way too simple but in fact\nI think it's actually quite profound in its simplicity and that is do you have\nA roadmap for retirement like do you have a written map and plan for how you're going to get from point a to point B do you have something that is documented measurable that you could look out right now to identify where you're at on your journey\nWhere you're headed what might be in front of you and what you would do if some of those potholes column or construction zones\nHow would you deviate what would be your teacher you have that figure it out and is that written and document it should be but is it\nAnd if it's not I mean if you're sitting there right now thinking yourself well no I don't have anything written\nI get my statements from my accounts I meet with my adviser quarterly and we talk about or golf games but I don't have anything written documented measured I certainly don't have any sort of road map I Want to offer that to you if you hear it keeps the well partners we provide a retirement map review it as a one page road map\nThat overviews your entire retirement scenario we look at everything from taxes to risk tolerance to fees and expenses to retirement income planning to do you have enough time have you done enough to live the life you want in retirement\nAnd we do all that with no cost no obligation finally you get guidance and advice from somebody not looking to sell you something that was the vision when I left my broker dealer scrap this whole idea of being a traditional financial advisor\nOh yeah I mean my business starts a financial advisor when I was with a broker dealer just like hundreds of thousands of other advisors card say all around America let's call it what it is a business card should say\nFinancial sales person but you don't want to work with a financial sales person with your life savings so we say financial advisors that was what I set up to change when I started Keystone our entire group of advisors have let banks\nBroker dealer insurance companies to work directly with you and our retirement map review is a second opinion and one page road map where you get your questions answered and you can ensure that you're doing the right thing with your money you can ensure that if you're on the right track\nYou can have that reaffirmed if there are areas you're unaware of when you want to know that when do you want to correct those you'd be the judge whether you want to work with us moving forward it keeps them that's not the point of the retire remembered you it's complimentary and it comes with no obligation but if you'd like to get that road map just like hundreds of other radio fans have done just like you we have offices in Chandler as well as Scottsdale\nAnd all starts with a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our advisors if you'd like to have a phone call for Fifteen minutes to kick off a second opinion with your life savings\nAnd you want that retirement map review\nSimply call us right now at one eight hundred seven six seven\nFifteen Fifteen on a schedule a Fifteen minute phone call\nThe number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen or you can visit us a Keystone well partners dot com and there's a spot right on the homepage that you can put your basic information and and we will contact you Monday morning to get that Fifteen minute phone calls yet this is way too important that your life savings I Want you to have a roadmap enough clarity\nRound the most important things related to her money\nAnd so back to the topic at hand we are going to talk today about what should your road map look like\nAnd I'm going to continue to ask question if you don't have one you should if you don't have something documented that you can review and identify whether you're on track or not you should are you on course you know some of you listen to show for a long time you know my background but before I was a financial advisor\nYou should argue one course you know somebody you listen to the show for a long time you know my background but before I was a financial advisor\nLong before I started keeps them well partners I was an airline pilot and I was flying out of originally Cincinnati and then LAX most recently when I met my wife\nWho is going to Arizona State at the time but just as you women do to us men I fell in love and I didn't want to travel twenty three days a month anymore flying all over the place as young airline pilot and my father in law has been an advisor for now Thirty years but at the time over Twenty years and he oddly enough I'd been a corporate pilot and his twenties and that was my exposure to the financial industry\nOh we make it really difficult for anybody to understand any they were talking about\nAnd for a long time that was the goal of the industry because if you were a financial advisor you were a broker your whole job was to make sure your clients knew\nThat they didn't understand what you were doing for them and that's why they needed you know I Hope that that shifting and people are realizing you know what I should actually understand the strategies that are in place for me I should understand everything I'm doing that a court level before I Do it\nAnd frankly we tell our clients are accused don't we say look you're not going to have the most a sexy strategies we're not going to put things together for you that you know we're not shorting again because Japan's been in this low inflationary environment\nAnd we're not going to call you with some hey let's short Netflix now yeah I mean you won't have the best story of the barbecue after church about your investment strategy\nBut you'll have an efficient strategy to low cost while diversify that you understand so you may not have the best stories a cocktail party but you'll be able to flip over your cocktail napkin and explain to your friend and twenty seconds why you invest money that way you do that is important to us here in Houston\nAnd I hope that the show each and every week started giving you a little bit more and more insight into doing a great job with your money\n... of the thousands that listen to the show very few you're actually clients of ours that's perfectly fine with me I Hope though that this helps you\nWith what you've worked her tail off for but if maybe you listen to the show for a long time and you have never taken us up on our retirement that review or one page roadmap that overviews your whole financial situation you can visit us anytime a Keystone partners dot com learn more about our from\nLearn more about my background and our other advisors we have a team of five advisors or sister company Keystone Law firm has three attorneys we have a team of about thirty people here between both of our firms here at our office you can read about our backgrounds and our biographies and what our passions are what's brought us to where we are today and you can very simply on the homepage\nRequest a retirement average view just putting your info and someone on my team will call you Monday morning and schedule a Fifteen minute phone call that's how we start the retirement map review is a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our advisors and you were you're just able to share with us what's going on in your life\nWhat's on your mind what maybe I sat on the radio show that prompted the phone call something that you maybe just want to double check on you want to make sure that you're doing things right maybe its taxes maybe it's due out too much risk not enough risk what am I fees and expenses Dr enough for retirement I mean what ever is on your mind\nThat's what we care about taste as good a Keystone well partners dot com right now\nAnd request the second opinion it might be the most valuable thing you do for yourself and your family all year long but I mentioned earlier in the first segment as an ex airline pilot how important and critical having a map\nAny plans for where you were headed and how you're going to get there was I mean that was a central component of becoming a private pilot\nWas learning how to follow a map and get from point a to point B safely and to navigate the uncertainties\nSo much to my surprise as an advisor I couldn't believe that hardly any financial advisors and I'm putting up air quotes actually built any sort of map for their clients I couldn't believe that how are they going to know where they're at on course or the off course of the of course have they deviated too far what are the winds doing or their storms I had what's the weather that destination\nWhat altitude are they gonna fly it do we need to adjust the opposite because now we have some turbulent air I mean none of that was being done and I started thinking not just about flying or a money but don't you think it's really hard to be on course or maximize our goals or potential really in anything in life\nIf we don't have a map to begin with I don't have a feel for where we need to get to where we're starting I mean I look at this as a Christian as the father of five as a husband\nOr kids we live out in Gilbert our kids go to a Christian my wife and I've been married we're coming up on our ten year anniversary right now five kids in ten years\nPretty crazy and you know I started thinking about like the life choices that I've made and the decisions that are making I Wish I could say that I've you know I look back on my life and I've always made the right decision and I'm I have no regrets and you know I mean at the end of the day you can say hey all of my decisions\nIs that I make I Wish I could say that I've you know I look back on my life and I've always made the right decision and I'm I have no regrets and you know I mean at the end of the day you can say hey all of my decisions have led to the person I Am today and and where God put me in place me but there are things that I Wish I had done better there are decisions I probably shouldn't have made or should have made\nYou know in hindsight but the thing that has helped guide my life and certainly the life of me as a husband and as a business owner and as a father is that I'm a Christian and I recognize that a lot of you listening right now have different faith backgrounds\nBut I'm just sharing with you what's on my heart which is it's been a lot easier to make decisions in life\nWhen I have a plum line on a map to work off\nYou see for me that's the Bible for me I'm able to look at a decision run it through a decision filter and say how does this aligned with what's valuable in my life how does this on line with what's most important to me you see that makes decision making a whole lot easier because I have a map you know from my wife and I it's like\nWe felt God's telling us to adopt and we flew across the world for times an adopted two kids that at the time or tenant nine from Ethiopia from a little village called my homemade Ethiopia\nThree hours in on a bumpy little road through the fog watching people walk past with donkeys and water pictures on their heads I mean it really was what you would think of got out to their village and you know adopted our boys back in Shay there now Seventeen and Fifteen Years old and a lot of our friend said why are you doing that\nThat's going to be really hard they're going to have trauma they've lost their birth parents like\nI mean how is that going to impact your other children that are so young and I mean do you guys know how to parent pre teens like ... I mean what's your plan here\nAnd we knew that it was going to be hard and we knew that we'd have challenges and we knew that we weren't the quit on her own to do it but we also knew that God was calling us to do something that that was something that needed to happen in our lives and it wasn't a hard decision it really wasn't in hindsight because\nIt was so clear based upon the map that I have from my life of what I'm going to do and what I'm going to be about that that was an easy decision now I don't tell you that story in any way to pat myself on the back or my wife because\nI don't think anything we did was great or amazing or speaks anything to us it's really to the glory of God that's all it is because we're so blessed by our children they needed homes they needed families we wanted to be parents it was a win win and it's nothing we should be commended for it's just one of those beautiful things were God takes\nDifficult messy broken people and brings it all together and restores those relationships and he's still restoring those relationships I Wish I could say it's been easy it hasn't been but I've never thought should have done that I've never thought why really regret doing that you know why because I have a roadmap for my life\nAnd maybe your own that looks different than mine but don't you think it's important to have one and titan is back to our money\nIn the same way that I always find it interesting when I asked people what they are kind of broad beliefs are in life and they say essentially like I don't know I kinda just do whatever I Want like I kind of just judge what I think is right hey there's no judgment from me but I think that's really hard way to make decisions because\nI mean it's just kind of what do you think there is no baseline or basis for the decision to be made well that's the same thing with our money when I asked people why did you buy this annuity\nAnd they go I don't know just kind of seems like a good thing to by the time like it didn't have a lot of risk\nI'm like well how does that fit into this goal or retirement income planning or maybe the growth that you need over the next ten years on this part of your portfolio raw fiery conversions or you know the shifting strategies you want to employ or how's it gonna affect the taxes for your spouse or when the first one he passes away you know all these sorts of questions and they're like well\nI don't really know I didn't really have a map when I did it I just I went to a you know a dinner seminar and they kind of told me the market was going to drop and I was terrified so I'll just put everything in a new disease we can do better\nWhen he'd something guiding our investment decisions and that should be a map\nThat should be your own personal tailored road map just for you and we called that map here in Houston while partners our retirement map review\n... is a one page road map that overviews your entire financial situation if you listen to the show at all you heard me talk about it it comes with no ... no obligations it starts with a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our advisors\nBut it's a one page roadmap that overviews your whole situation and for many of you to be the first time you've ever seen your whole financial retirement situation laid out in a one page understandable road map\nI mean everything from tax plenty retirement income planning risk tolerance\nWhat rate of return on your body would be okay but what about these and expenses what are you pain right now will your money last what kind of life can you live when should you be taking Social Security estate planning all of these things and so much more is what we put together for you specifically for you\nWhat kind of life can you live when should you be taking Social Security estate planning all of these things and so much more is what we put together for you specifically for you here accused of what partners and we've done this for hundreds of radio fans just like you who called and wrote the numbers one eight hundred should have said earlier we got to say at the numbers only hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nSo if you're listening and you would like the second opinion give us a call\nThe number is one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nAnd for most of us it will be the first time you've ever sat down with an independent fiduciary like us You're used to well partners we're an independent registered investment advisory firm or we don't have a broker dealer we're not selling you investment products on behalf of our broker dealer it'll be the first time for many of you you ever sat down\nWith an independent from like us not looking to sell you a product but rather giving you a clear and an understandable breakdown of where you stand on the most important things that your retirement\nLet us help you it doesn't obligate due to become a client anyway we've done this for a lot of folks who didn't become ongoing quite the Keystone\nObviously will share with you if you'd like our help and we have some improvements that we suggest and you'd like us to help you with those will share with you how we do that and what we charge but I Hope you listen to the show long enough to know my heart it's not that we're gonna try to get you in here pressure you to become a client if it makes sense for everybody involved great if it doesn't that's okay to call us down the road\nAnd what ended up happening is you jumped out of a airplane was perfectly mechanically sound with the skies completely clear and wins lightened variable you jumped out and then as you were flying parachuting down to earth\nThe pilots are sitting there looking out the windshield going [laughter]\nYeah Ken around on that one whether seems real what a beautiful day out here they passed me the ... Gulf cookies given my coffee and you as you're flying down you're yelling up going wait I I don't think I should have jumped\nSorry to a jumped out how much money to that cost you you've got to have a flight plan you have to have a map you have to know where you're headed you have to know where you started you better know where you're going along the way if you want to have long term success if you

behind the retirement of you it's really my effort when I left my broker dealer and started Keystone I wanted to have a deliverable that people actually understood\nLike I wanted to come up with a way to convey to you and other hard working Americans like the most important things in their plan that no one was telling them like ways to simplify what they're doing ways to reduce their costs\nWe used to get better returns without increasing the risk by just being more efficient maybe it doesn't make their broker dealer more money but it puts it back in your pocket that's the whole vision of why I started Keystone I Want to pull back the curtain on this industry\nSo that you can actually get to your destination lay on the beach enjoy the retirement that you wanted and go wow that wasn't as

your host each and every weekend my name is John ... and I'm the founder and managing director of Keystone well partners and I like to say I'm a reformed broker I started out as a traditional financial advisor as I Would call it more of a broker\nAnd started Keystone really an effort to do things better for you in a way of removing middlemen removing the conflicts of interest so that you could get the advice you deserve on your entire life saving and if anything we talked about today on the show prompts you don't want a second opinion\nMaybe you're saying I haven't had a second opinion in a long time maybe you've never had worked with an advisor maybe you've just been said in your retirement plans and now you're nearing retirement and you're thinking\nThat I really haven't broken down everything from tax planning to fees and expenses to what type of retirement can I really have when should I take Social Security\nYou know do I take a lump sum pension or do I take the pension payment whatever the decisions are that are facing you you don't have to do it alone you have an independent credential fiduciary right here in the Phoenix area we have offices in Chandler as

now by going to Keystone wealth partners dot com and right there on the homepage spot for you to say I'd like to retire remember do again that's Keystone wealth partners dot com\nBut as we close out this final say go to the show I Want to jump back into the broad topic that we've been discussing here today\nWhich is do you have a roadmap\nBut we talked about defining the destination preparing for your flight adjusting along the way I one of the last two things when we got to land safely and then enjoy the destination upon arrival why might paralleling flight plans because I was an airline pilot before I became a financial advisor and as I mentioned throughout the show it shocked me as a young adviser\nThat there was very little planning or defined strategy and mapping of where clients word today and where they needed to get it was a lot more just here's a great investment let's sell them let's sell this plan on this thing that makes us a commission that's not an your best interest that index attracts the five hundred largest\nMore just here's a great investment let's sell them let's sell this plan on this thing that makes us commission that's not in your best interest that index attracts the five hundred largest us stocks has doubled your money sooner than every seven years and the average American has barely outpaced inflation according to doubt bar that's mostly because we don't have a map\nAnd we're not getting good advice everything's skewed in Wall Street's favor and the broker dealers favor and your brokers favor and not in yours so the average American has made four percent when the simplest strategies of you know putting on a vanguard logged in in four seconds and open it has to be five hundred index fund in your account\nHas made a life in the stakes are way too high this is all of what you saved and that's the purpose of this show each and every week is that\nI Want to be able to pull back the curtain for you and just say look this isn't a knock on how much I despise your advisor or the industry I used to do all these things I was trained in how to do these things\nThat's why I scraps the whole thing and started Keystone and that's what all of our advisors here left their banks and broker dealers and insurance companies to remove the conflicts and do it directly for our clients\nThat's why I Do this radio show that's why I offer you this retirement that review we don't need more business I Love helping people and providing perspective for you so you can do a good job on your money that's why I promote come in and get a retirement
