University\nBut also political campaigns and we need to catch up our understanding catch up our knowledge of the rules of the game so we're no longer being taken advantage of\nWe have a thing in the in the newsroom is that everybody has their their tweet deck up and when they see that the president of the United states has treated for the first time in the morning they'll say he's on Twitter and then that person has to stand up and and read the tweet\nIs just just President Trump understand this really really well or is he just doing it and is he making it the divisions even wider\nThe opening of the book is Trump's very first tweet\nAnd he joined social media back in two thousand and nine and when not with politics and mine is funny to go back in time he actually joins as a way to market an upcoming TV appearance that he's going to read the top ten list on the Letterman show and the purpose of going on the Letterman show is to try and plug\nThe declining ratings of uh The Apprentice apprentices going down and ratings and they're trying to figure anything and everything to save the ratings and they turned to Twitter\nAnd um and this actually like back to your prior question what happens is that slowly but surely\nHe like the rest of us the columns addicted which is another reason why you can't say you know maybe it would just shouldn't use the space will\nPeople become addicted to it it's it's designed to be addicted\nAnd um he develops um a a talent for it ah and basically hits on certain tactics that now lots of people use but at the time uh they're kinda game changing your one for example is he gets into arguments with people online if you go back in time\nThis was something new you know a celebrity a businessman getting an arguments like a shouting teenager and yet it drew what he wanted\nWhich was attention and then the new rule the game is attention is power and important again going back to this notion even if we do you like\nYour story illustrates another key fact here\nNinety six percent of journalists are on Twitter so even if you're not on it\nThe journalistic you listen to on the radio or you read in the newspaper walks on the TV news\nThey're getting their ideas of what to cover based off of not just what they see online but by what is trending on line and one of the things again the Trump understood back then and carry forward through the election and even today\nIs that he can use that attention that power\nTo change the news cycle so whenever there is a scandal that's going badly for him and and one space will create a different kind of scandal a different kind of argument another and then the press will follow\nAnd you know frankly that's continued all the way to what's playing out right now\nOkay well pi

intimidating suddenly not having a job to go to her every day for the loss of a close friend or life partner\nCan make retirement feel overwhelming some retirees may feel like they're too old to do much for the retirement is the beginning of the author Helen Wilkes says that doesn't have to be the case\nShe wrote her book the aging of Aquarius to inspire her fellow retirees to aim higher because she says retirement has been better to her than expected\nLife kept getting better and better for me and I kept catching myself to believe that this was true\nIt was so very different from what I expected and then I started looking around me and realizing that people were actively doing all kinds of things and their life was getting richer and better at a time when they expected to be doing I think\nAnd it was just so amazing to me that I started to you know just even take notes for myself so that all these amazing people and they grew [laughter]\nJust kept on growing I kept meeting more people\nAnd realizing that we have been sold a bill of goods that retirement is just sitting under a palm tree with a drink at our hand or cruising endlessly there's so much that people still have to give I don't want to get\nWe feel so much more meaningful and so much better about ourselves when we're getting back to the world in some way\nWe look says where the improving medicine and extended life expectancies were destined to see\nMore and more retirees looking for new ways to enjoy their lives later on in life\nMost of us will stand a third of our life in retirement and some of us even longer it's going to be the new norm in no time if not already for people to spend as long and retirement and they did in their working life\nForty years if you work from the time you were twenty to the time you were sixty then you're going to be sixty\nTwo hundred people are saying octogenarian in super seniors as they're called\nAre growing astronomically thanks to modern medicine and better health care we know more about diet we know about the importance of exercise\nWe know about the importance of socialization which you mentioned earlier all of these factors are entering into a new world for seniors and for people who are approaching retirement\nWilkes says she felt inspired by her retirement to try new things that's when she stumbled into an old box of letters and was struck by your new parents and the second career\nWhen I retired partly I was taking care of my mother who was having some health issues at that point partly also I was wondering who I Am and\nWas unfinished in my life and in that context I knew that\nMy father had a box of ... that had come to him when I was a child and I knew of them and my mother had always kept them in a special box when she came to live with me she\nBrought the box and one day I decided to open the box\nIt simply turned my life around because I didn't realize\nIn many ways those letters were from people in Europe who had been dying to come\nTo America or to any country that would have them but\nBecause they were Jews nobody wanted them and I suddenly realized that if I just put all these letters back in the box it would be as if all these people who had sprang to life through their writing was killing them all over again so I wound up\nA book originally or just for me and for my family that\nPeople encouraged me to reach a wider audience and I was lucky university press published it all of this led me to realize that I was like the process of writing and have going within\nWays that I had never had an opportunity to do a when I was in the working world\nAnd so writing has now become one of the things I Love doing\nRoque says or experience of funding this new post retirement crafts for her so doesn't have to be the exception that can be the rule\nRetirement can beat the beginning of a whole new way of life for you and I'm encouraging people to look forward to that way of life that's productive and active rather than just consuming more and more of the world's goods\nYou want music\nWhen was the last time you took piano lessons you get that as a child so could you do now and if you can't manage ship piano maybe you could\nTry something a little easier or some other way but everybody has something\nOf course some people may struggled to find that next great passion bears Wilkes says that's no problem and she has a few brainstorming questions to help others explore their interests in New ways\nSome of my questions if you knew you couldn't fail what would you do\nIf you knew you could start something fresh without anybody laughing at you or making fun of you what would you do what voices are you hearing from your past that said ... who do you think you are you're too old for this or what are the voices and the tapes that are playing in your head\nThat are preventing you from living your life fully\nEnd with those questions in mind Wilkes says it's time to take those passions in your own hands and said new aspirations\nI start with piece of paper and pen [laughter] not even a device\nAnd I start writing things down and I make long long list of things that are practical and things that are completely off the wall\nAnd you may have or you know where things are going to taste cute I recently encountered a retired gentleman and at sixty five year he retired he decided for the first time in his life that he was going to sing in public he had never done it\nHe is now been offered contract as a student in major Academy of music where he's going to go and developed his voice sixty five even me ever sang a note in his life and yet there's a whole new avenue opening up for him\nSometimes retirement can be an isolating experience no on our our specialties the jobs people if you give them meaning and going to be the connections people make within their industries\n... says she hopes people can see that as an opportunity instead of a curse an opportunity to make new friends and learn new things\nImpulsivity more impulsivity with kids\nLess ability to see in the future meaning to know the consequences of one of the actions [laughter] I just imagine going into a school in the middle of the day going into a classroom to have a fight I mean who is thinking like that you have to not be aware of the consequences of your actions\nSo that's a perfect example and

was at\nAnd he was really close to getting out under four months or something he would have been six months he would have been out\nThey got him this stuff and she said by the way get me six extra pair so underpants because they didn't have cleaned underpants are new underpants and he got it and then his locker was rated and they immediately threw him back into a secure facility\nThe parole board decided that this small infraction was enough to rescind his parole and Carter was sent back to prison\nCarter spend his time learning the law and finding a pro bono attorney to secure his parole he sued the parole board and finally got out but ... says that Carter shouldn't have had to serve his sentence or plead for his parole the way an adult would he should have been tried and able to serve his sentence in a juvenile facility\nI think the juvenile system is totally able to handle this\nPeople seem to juvenile system is you know piece of cake some kind of flood her game or

with a career to think about\nIn fact none of the main characters are under the age of twenty\nThe term why it can be limiting\nMany people look down on that designation which is itself an arbitrary reason to eliminate something from your radar because in essence all PG Thirteen movies are for young adults and adults still go see Jurassic World and marvel movies ultimately an absolutely

action officer with something come as us are with the Phoenix ... thank you\nThis little ... nothing piece of paper then goes zoning and also we found was owning violation from all sorts of things that we could combat a crew problem king had talked about that you've already talked a little bit about these these relationships but how you can think outside the box as it relates to come in the action\nAbsolutely up thinking outside the box is really the cornerstone of what we do like you said bringing in other partners to hit problem locations where they're at sometimes we can't necessarily arrest our way out of a problem and I think hitting sometimes property owners that\nReally don't care about the neighborhood or have no vested knowledge or slum lord okay you're going in and they really don't have any vested interest in neighborhoods are making a better so one way that we have in the past is bringing in our zoning partners through the ss our report and other issues\nUm and hitting them were accounts and for a slum lord and if you want to use your term it's in the pocketbook and when you can accumulate fines of several hundred thousand dollars over the course of time that puts a lot of pressure on that person to either a fix the problem or be selling get out to somebody that really cares about the neighborhood and wants to make it better\nYou know we have a lot of centralized the details you know when talking about these different problem places you know many times as bars or night clubs can become a problem we have the liquor enforcement team we have all the issue but who knows that precinct knows that place better than the precinct commander and his officers to include the from the actual officers\nWell and I'd also have to throw into that nobody knows the community better than the community members living in those neighborhoods the flowers and that's why again that that partnership you have to have that there because\nEverybody wants a safe community to live in and now there are a lot of fears retaliation listening so it's it's up to us continue to connect to break down those barriers so there's a level of comfort in the level of trust so that they can bring us that information to be able to help them solve those problems because the community I mean as a police department\nI can bring the entire team together and we can offer solutions to the challenges but the community is also part of that solution making process so you've got to reach out and get them involved\nHow do they get in touch it can be your preaching can be any preaching how do people find out where they live\nHow do they reach out to the community action officers in Phoenix absolutely they can reach out and call each precinct directly and find out who their specific community action officer is or they can go to you know WWW dot Phoenix dot Gov backslash police\nOr type in their address little show much counsel district in which for police precinct they live in and when they click on that they immediately get to see the list of community action officers who's there precinct commander and just go from there\nYou know or if we could cause I Know there's people right now driving pencils and paper and so forth can you give that a point of contact one more time regarding the main uh email contact\nYou bad it's WWW dot Phoenix dot Gov\nBackslash police that'll take you to the Phoenix police departments main page then click on precinct\nAnd then you'll be able to type in your address and provide you the information like I said such as the police precinct that reside in the council district council members are and then once you click on that actual precinct will get a list of your community action officers your commander and a lot of different information\nAnd if that doesn't uh you know some good to you listening audience out there you can always contact silent witness silent witness will get the information in anonymous manner\nThat would take it to work every needs to go and many times and I think Daniel back me up on this solid witness will absolutely contact the ... because sometimes it is something\nLike a zoning
