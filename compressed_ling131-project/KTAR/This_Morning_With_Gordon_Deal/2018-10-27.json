obviously had one of the worst marches in the last several decades we have interest rates rising inflation expected to take off\nBut I Want to focus back on really what's important long term not what's going on right this moment but what really\nDo you need to be thinking about in terms of what are some of the obstacles water some of the things that are on a trip you up long term with your money one of the things you should be focused on rather than what the market to the last week one of the market you last month so I Want to address the four biggest land mines\nThe challenge your investment goals\nAnd these landmines represent really the obstacles that most often are going to impede your progress and maybe you've already figured out some of these landmines and I think as I talk about the you're going to identify personally with many of them maybe all of them\nMy experiences financial planner having worked with countless investors know tells me that in reality the biggest threat that we all have to our success the biggest threat you have to your success with your money well you know Rick Edelman a financial advisor I greatly respect\nHas written and spoke at great length about what he calls these four obstacles and here's what they are number one\nProcrastination the number one obstacle and land mine that you have to accomplishing your financial goals is procrastination again I told you it yourself\nHow many of you can relate to being a procrastinator at some point in your life I mean obviously if you're listening you're a human being you most likely struggle with procrastination but are you a hardcore procrastinator\nNaturally we tend to probably brought us with ourselves we procrastinate on some things but I Know I Do from time to time and it's actually a massive problem related to our money but beyond that I Want you to really understand the impact of procrastination the best time to start investing is now\nEvery single day you wait you lose the impact of compound interest which Albert Einstein famously quoted as the eighth wonder of the world the impact on the future of value of your account realized from across the nation is massively undermined and painstakingly reduced\nTo here's another observation purely from a behavioral standpoint is it's highly likely that those who don't start saving\nHere's another observation purely from a behavioral standpoint is it's highly likely that those who don't start saving now we'll probably never start like if you're someone who says you know John I just don't quite make enough like I I just need to make a little more I'll save a little bit more wrong\nThe behavioral finance studies show if you can't save a percentage of your income at whatever you're making right now it's not dependent upon you earning higher wages here's another observation from behavioral standpoint it is highly likely that those who do not start saving now we'll probably never start\nSo please call them today and for a zero seven oh two thirty thirty and set up that first date comfortable relaxed conversational that's the best way to get started call for a zero seven oh two thirty thirty\nKeystone partners is a registered invested advisory for he's done well partners and keep some law for our separate entity and must be engaged independently\n[noise]\nWelcome back to the program thank you for joining me on Mitt busting with Keystone while partners on your host Jon ... founder and managing director of Keystone well partners and today we are talking about the for land mines that impede our success\nAnd if you'd like to know more about how we help people and how the things that I'm sharing with you today apply\nIn your life and your situation you can call us twenty four hours a day seven days a week at one eight hundred\nSeven six seven Fifteen fifty not again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to schedule your one page retirement map review the first step is that phone call and we'll schedule a ten minute time for you to chat with one of our credential financial advisors\nAnd you'll be able to share your situation your concerns your objectives\nAnd if we think we can help you and our retirement that review process would be beneficial\nWe will schedule a convenient time for you to sit down with us and expand upon what's going on in your life\nAnd make sure you have all the information you need to do the best job possible with what you ... your lifetime to save again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine or you can visit us anytime a Keystone while partners dot com\nClick on retirement that purview and I remember my team will schedule a convenient ten minute phone call for you to start\nRetiring map review process but did they want to talk about the number to land mine and having financial success and that is something that I think we may all struggle with more now than ever before which is spending habits in twenty first century America and certainly in Chandler and Gilbert the affluence that we have\nThat we possess the ability to place discretionary income in a variety of places makes it very challenging I think it's distorted our perception on really how much money we actually have\nBut in spite of that did you know that over fifty percent of Americans would have no way to cover an unexpected expense of a thousand dollars isn't that wild in half of America\nHave to put a thousand dollar expense on a credit card and we wonder why we have this much debt and it's mostly due to spending habits now sure we'll talk about that we don't have enough money we can't save because we just don't make enough but generally the bigger impact\nIs on her spending habits in fact there is a quote by Clifford Cohen that I Love it says the way Americans tend to buy things is a person who has twenty dollars will buy something for forty you know if it's marked down from a hundred and isn't that true and just like procrastination this is yet another example where the problem is not\nThe current president or low interest rates is us and our behavior your spending habits have a huge impact on\nOur ability to accomplish or financial dreams and goals\nAnd to help us understand this more deeply let's examine a couple of living a very typical American lifestyle are married couple and this example as the combined income of sixty thousand dollars which represents the annual average income in the United states today you know interestingly Gilbert was actually just named highest median income in the state of Arizona\nAt just under a hundred thousand dollars a year so we're living in a little bubble out and Gilbert and certainly in Chandler Scottsdale places like that certainly Arcadia\nLot of areas here in Phoenix that are much higher than that because that includes a lot of these smaller Midwest towns but so let's just remember it applied on sixty thousand dark up all of this is even more likeable for most of you listening but now this couple that you know makes the national average is sixty year they don't spend extravagantly and like many couples they are concerned\nThat they just can't seem to save enough money\nYou know Keystone here in my practice we frequently meet people who are in the same boat all the time\nAnd in one case I think of an extreme example we had a physician come in a few months back he was sixty eight years old so nearly Seventy still working hurting over four hundred thousand dollars\nCome in a few months back he was sixty eight years old so nearly Seventy still working burning over four hundred thousand dollars a year and had been for quite some time\nHad less than two hundred thousand dollars in liquid investments I mean you you sit there and scratch your head and certainly for those that don't make four hundred thousand dollars a year you're thinking yourself\nAnd if I if I made four hundred grand a year and I have a ton saved I mean I I don't have a lot said maybe because I I just don't make as much I don't have as much which is partly true but it's more that habits\nOf saving that habit of spending less than you make\nPrioritizing saving and obviously that's an extreme example but it goes to show you that it's really not dependent upon your income level as much as it is your discipline with your spending habits with the second landmine that we're talking about\nSo back to this couple you know the same couple that doesn't have enough money to save right because what they're saying is you know we aren't really spending a whole lot of money we just can't seem to find anywhere to save money because we're just not making enough and they're saying this while they're driving around a forty five thousand dollar SUV with a Starbucks latte and they're called Boulder in a brand new iPhone\nThis is a perfect example of how spending habits absolutely impact our ability to save far more\nThan even outside factors such as Wall Street and the stock market\nAnd if you have questions about anything you here today you can call us twenty four hours a day seven days a week a one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine again that number's one eight hundred\nSeven six seven Fifteen fifty nine to schedule your one page retirement map review and when you call in to schedule your one page retirement preview here's what you can expect a member of my team will schedule a ten minute call for one of our financial advisors to call you back\nYou'll be able to share with us your concerns some of your goals some of the things that are on your mind and will in turn tell you how we think we can help\nAnd if it makes sense for both parties moving forward we will schedule your first visit with us at one of our offices either in Chandler Scottsdale to get your complimentary Taylor customized one page retirement map review that you've heard me talk so much about on the show again that number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nSo let's put this in perspective let's say that while the same couple is on their way to work each of them stops to get a cup of coffee in a pastry right it's reasonable to say that that may cost four dollars and fifty cents later while at work each of them grabs a soda from the vending machine for another Seventy five cents adding up their spending\nThey now have a combined because they're both doing this daily spending of about ten bucks ten dollars and fifty cents so ask yourself this\nAre they doing anything outrageous well the answer is no in fact are examples conservative on the Costa Coffee snacks vending machine items within today's pricing world the actual totals are probably greater well let's just give this couple the benefit of the doubt even with that pricing generosity if you assume that there are twenty two working days per month our couple is spending\nTwo hundred and thirty one dollars each month\nWhich totals two thousand seven hundred and Seventy two dollars a year\nA little less than three grand a year on extras oddly enough of our couple let's call them the Jacksons made one small change and stopping their daily snacking coffee habits they could save five percent of their income it's true they are literally spending more than five percent of their annual income on complete junk\nStuff that they don't even need their ... it away on nothing and the crazy thing is if all they did was saved that five percent over forty years they would have earned more than one million dollars by retirement that's it so by choosing to save that five percent\nFrom the age of twenty earning ten percent a year on that invested income they could retire at age sixty five with more than one million dollars this is proof that it's all about our behavior in her spending habits it's not really about our income potential\nAnd I'd like to offer you the opportunity to come in and get our tailored retirement map of you know it's called the retirement map for a reason it's our one page roadmap here Keystone that overviews your entire retirement situation\nAnd if you're thinking well John it sounds too simple one page no it's not too simple in fact often times it's the first chance you've ever had to sit down with an independent film credential do Sherry whose putting your needs above selling a product to get an understandable and it clear breakdown of where you stand\nWe make it very simple the first step is a phone call we have a team standing by right now one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine\nAgain the number one eight hundred seven six seven one five five nine\nAnd their objective is simply to get you scheduled for a ten minute phone call with one of our credential financial advisors where you can express some of the things that you're concerned about some of the things that are on your mind and what you're looking for and if we think our process could be helpful well then take the next step\nWhich is a sixty minutes sit down to sixty minutes of your time worth it for a second opinion everything you've worked your lifetime to save of course I'm biased but I think it absolutely is\nAnd they sit down to sixty minutes of your time worth it for a second opinion everything you've worked your lifetime to save of course I'm biased but I think it absolutely is and let me go over again the value you get when you come in to meet with us we'll list all your concerns and objectives right on the map and then put our recommendations on there as well and tell you what we think you could be doing to improve your situation\nAnd obviously you be the judge on whether you want to act on that\nAdditionally will provide your retirement income protection\nAre you going to be OK in retirement will your income hold up and also are you taking those income distribution in the most tax efficient manner possible\nMaybe even more importantly will help answer the question what rate of return you need in retirement to accomplish all your goals because let's face it someone who needs three percent can invest very differently than someone who needs to earn a seven percent rate of return on their money\nAnd you having that knowledge is a vital piece of your success in your confidence in retirement\nThe last thing we provide during your retirement ... is a stress test well look at the way you're currently structured and back tested in times of extreme market volatility to ensure that you and your family will be OK regardless of what happens next in the stock market you have too much risk not enough risk will go through that with you how do you protect in hedge against risk\nBut now more than ever we better be prepared\nFor rising interest rates and so what are a few things you can do will avoid long term bonds long term fixed income rising interest rates means falling bond prices but not all fixed income investments are created equal the longer until your bond matures the more drastic the decline as the rate increases\nSo for many the planned to mitigate this interesting risk consistent simply avoiding the urge to sell bonds on the secondary market a law so if you own bonds I Know I'm getting a little bit into the weeds here but if you own bonds\nAnd you think well I'm just going to hold them until maturity John So I don't care if interest rates rise because I'll just let the mature\nNot so fast\nBecause this is just an example of jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire because historically if your money has to double every twenty to twenty five years when you finally get your money back at maturity is it actually worth what it was Twenty years earlier no it's been cut in half\nAnd in a big inflationary environment it maybe it's been cut by two thirds\nSo that's really not something\nThat we advocate here he's no operators we don't use any long term bombs in our portfolios for that reason I mean you're probably out of the stock market into bonds in an effort to reduce risk and reduced volatility well in a rising interest rate environment where inflation is expected and the fed has already stated that rates will be coming up due to the fact that the economy's doing so well\nProbably not a good idea to go along in bonds avoid long term CDs same exact principle as what I just referred to and probably diversify\nOwn equities I get it as rates rise sometimes the economy slows there's volatility in the markets so you may want to insulate yourself from that and say I need to jump out of the stock market wrong\nIf you have a ten year time horizon or longer on your money this short term volatility is a positive for you by more when it slow it doesn't have an impact on your long term goals and in fact the reason equities or a good investment inflationary time periods is because if you think about it practically these companies that you're an owner of that you're a shareholder of when you own their stock\nThey're able to adjust prices they're nimble they can adjust pricing to maintain proportional profits right that's why it's inflation takes off when you go to the grocery store you have to pay more for milk because ultimately the dairy farmers\nAre going to charge more inflationary type rates to the grocery store the grocery store is in turn not going to lose money they're going to charge more to us as the consumer when we go to the checkout line\nAnd I'd like to offer the next five colors the opportunity to come in and get our tailored retirement map review\nAnd if you're wondering what the first step and that is just be one of the next five colors to call one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen now and again the number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen Fifteen and a member of my team who standing by right now will schedule a ten minute phone call with one of our credential reduce years\nSo that you can discuss your needs you can outline your goals will tell you how we think our process might be able to help you and you can decide whether you think it's a good fit to schedule another visit with us and take the next step\nAnd let me go over the value you get when you come in and meet with us you know for most of you to be the first time you've ever sat down\nWith an independent film me credentialed flus you're not looking to sell you something but rather give you a clear and an understandable breakdown of exactly where you stand with your money we will go through everything from retirement and complaining tax reduction\nSeason expenses what rate of return to you need on your money to be OK in retirement will your money last how about your state planning what about Social Security plenty any myriad of other things that you have even thought of\nAnd we'll put here's the most part we put it on I ...\nHow about your state planning what about Social Security planning in a myriad of other things that you have even thought of and we'll put here's the most part we put it on a one page giant go off the map\nThat's understandable but it's a clear break down and the benefit to that as you're able to come in and say whoa I can actually see clearly on one spot the key components of my retirement but it can make sense of this stuff this is great\nThat's what we want for you

procrastination spending habits inflation give us a call one eight hundred seven six seven\nFifteen fifty nine we're an independent registered investment advisory firm we have offices in Chandler\nAs

about something particularly relevant and so for many of you\nTaxes are on our minds taxes have been in the news and that is our fourth landmine because understanding how to be tax efficient maybe one of the most impactful things you do in accomplishing your financial goals and I think you know we're all United in our dislike of taxes\nOne of the most impactful things you do in accomplishing your financial goals and I think you know we're all United in our dislike of taxes like according to the Tax Foundation sometime over the first couple of weeks of April is really what we call your tax freedom day mean that every dollar you earn\nThe first three and a half months or so of the year\nGoes for you to pay taxes\nHere's another way to put it nearly one third of our time at work every day is spent simply to work to pay our taxes because besides federal tax there is also state tax local tax capital gains tax state tax sales tax property tax\nMust face it we're getting hit from taxes all over the place and sometimes we lose sight of the fact that it's not what we make\nBut it's rather what we actually keep\nThe matters you know taxes are a natural part of our life\nYet the tax efficiency of your portfolio critically important and we don't we must pay our fair share right and who can really know what that amount is to be honest but there are specific strategy surrounding taxes that can significantly impact your ability retire and retire well and when applied directly\nThese tax strategies a future planning and being proactive\nMay have a bigger impact on your success of your financial freedom than the underlying investment performance itself that we tend to spend so much time fix setting in studying and evaluating sadly most people have failed to do any sort of proactive tax plan you know what am I talking to but I mean just think about your situation right now many of you listening\nWith an angel advisors you have CPAs maybe you use TurboTax maybe you
