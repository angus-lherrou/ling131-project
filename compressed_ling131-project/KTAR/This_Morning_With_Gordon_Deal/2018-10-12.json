get to the side typically how often we get paid our company decides that\nBut the issue is with so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck um you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something else come up before your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so\nNow we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this um or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check\n'em but not as alone more as ... you know they might

three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee\nUm which you know is an inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than from those interest rates ended up being\nVery as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks some people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that it's actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reason for that I think going into this story I thought you know there must be some tax rate than or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that's um their contract with that company it depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so\nUm you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charge more so it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with

Know someone that get paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me so that conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the pressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional companies to change the way they paid in their cycle\nYeah I think we're
