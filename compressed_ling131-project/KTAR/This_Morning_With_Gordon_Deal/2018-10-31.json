going to be covered\nBut you know when you look at those numbers you know the numbers are up you know these are just claims that are big enough for people to be worth it filing a claim you could have a direct a bowl of several hundred dollars before it kicks in so obviously when we're talking about the spike we're talking about big collar claims [laughter]\nUm so you might even have a couple of
