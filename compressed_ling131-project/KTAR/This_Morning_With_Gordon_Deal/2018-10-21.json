game seven of the world series and five million more than tuned into the decisive game seven of the NBA Finals\nUrban says whether we all know does it or not video games have become as major and entertain medium is anything else\nPerhaps too easy parallel to draw with the history of cinema\nA useful analogy and it takes us pretty far but not all the way where the early days of cinema it was merely a technical achievement that cinema was great because all the sudden they're moving pictures and all of a sudden there's sound with them and venture there's color and all these different technical advances\nHelped people who are thinking in terms of artistry and self expression they started to use these tools to their advantage Orson Welles certainly didn't invent cinema but he revolutionized that he demonstrated that it is a ballot artistic platform\nOr art form we felt the same sort of development with video games were beginning at Nineteen fifty eight at a government lab

for ... Columbine shooters in the months leading up to the massacre\nMore recently parenting groups have come out against games like call of duty in mortal combat for exposing children to increasingly realistic violence\nUrban says this isn't so much of a problem with video games as it is something the entire culture needs directed where people don't\nUnderstand that video games are just another form of expression and they're still seen as\nSomething other than what we're accustomed to from our storytelling media a large part of that I think has to do with the perception of video games as violent most people when we think of video games we think of\nGuns and militaristic shoot 'em ups first person shooter games and it's true that those are often the most popular and best selling games every year just as the most popular and bestselling films tend to be you know quite violent but at the same time just as though there's a lot of violence at the cineplex there\nAre also the local our house theaters showing great thoughtful quiet contemplate of films video games work the same way there\nAre an enormous number of really beautiful smaller games are independent games made by individuals who are just trying to get some idea across\nUrban says it's important for people to see video games as more than just violent uses there's so much more to the vast library of games then just first person shooters\nVideo games can teach empathy they can teach social skills video games can teach high level problem solving they can be as maddening in some regards is the most difficult crossword puzzles they can teach us motor control in some regards\nThere are frivolous video games they're our video games that are as junkie and as brain candy like as the worst Hollywood spectacles but there are also video games that are\nAre working at a deep intellectual level and making us rethink the world and our own assumptions about it\n... it was a child in the Nineteen seventies the light bulb that video games could be more than just disposable entertainment wind off in his mind when he was just a kid\nIt's one of those experiences that right now we take for granted it's so mundane that we no longer think about it\nThere was a game called adventure on the Atari twenty six hundred\nAnd this was the first game where there was an avatar on the screen that represented us as players and of course this is obvious now we have avatars and every game we play where all these characters and all these games\nBut the first time that we solved after I saw that was this little innocuous square on an Atari twenty six hundred that all the sudden that was me somehow on the screen and I'm also sitting on the floor of the living room with the controller the joystick in my hand\nThat represents a fundamental shift in what it means to be human and that sounds like a grand statement but I think it's true that Walt Whitman famously said I'm large I contain multitudes and he was speaking about how each of us as an individual\nHas all these different voices and personality is an attitude and we are complex difficult creatures with that little square and adventure for the first time it wasn't that I contain multitudes it's that I Am multitudes I Am more than one thing at one time\nAnd as time has gone on bourbon says that experiences become even more engaging is the video game industry has grown more and more vast\nThe greatest strength of the video game medium is that diversity of games and kind of games and that goes along with the diversity of the players themselves everybody plays games now every demographic every age group it's a very exciting thing and\nI think that speaks to what makes this medium slightly different from books which I Love obviously I've written a book there's an indoor activity to read it and there's an indoor activity to watching a movie I don't think we're merely passive viewers\nBut when we play a video game there can be a social aspect that is enormously rewarding and I think that communal experience of telling and sharing and experiencing stories together is very exciting\nUrban says that ultimately like

culture what's new and old an entertainment movies with bank heists tend to be action packed full of Che sequences and maybe a dramatic shootout\nWhat bank robbery films tend not to be are quiet meditations on aging\nBut that's exactly what director David Lowery is latest film the old man and the gun set out to be\nThe old man and the gun gain some press over the last few months because star Robert Redford announced it would be his final film performance now whether that holds true remains to be seen but if it does this movie is a fitting sendoff\nRedford stars as an aging bank robber based on the real life criminal Forrest Tucker\nIn the film Tucker is a gentleman stick 'em up artist a man who wields a gun at banks before complementing the tellers combing their fears and walking out with a bag of cash the film also follows his budding romance with jewel a similarly aged woman who is not a bank robber\nPlayed by ...\nThe old man and a gun features several robberies scenes but never becomes an action film the music score is relaxing and the film itself is shot on an old film stock that makes it look like a came straight from the Nineteen seventies\nLowry is probably not a director most audiences no he's responsible for the live action version of Pete's Dragon as well as the Indy darling ain't them bodies saints and a ghost story\nAt this point in his career Lowry signature move is being incredibly patient\nHe lets shots linger longer than most other directors would and allows silenced holders moments together these two simple strategies make his movies feel warmer more lived in\nIt's a style I Love but one that many would probably describe is boring\nMaybe so but it works here and it allows Redford in space it both the opportunity to display their incredible acting talents even late in their careers\nSpace it turns into a wonderful performance\nBut ultimately this movie is most interested in giving Redford a graceful sendoff far away from the worlds of comic book movies and genre thrillers the old man and a gun won't be a box office jog or not or many people's favorite movie of the year\nBut it is incredibly charming and a must see for lifelong fans of Robert Redford\nWhat a day for tennis you ready to play\nIs everything alright decided past share a liquor dean knows that allergy congestion can get in a way of enjoying the moment

and your family say [noise]\nWelcome to watch I in your house Italian chief ... with Phoenix fire department\nThank you for joining us today we would like to take this opportunity to think Bonneville Broadcasting for allowing it just went out to discuss what is happening in public safety sharing emergency response safety tests and discussing issues that pertain directly to the health of our community and the firefighters he served as communities\nTo today with like ... introduced and wealth can\nOur guest on today's show we have to fire fighter makes mess with the Phoenix tire department ... how do you think you [noise]\nSo might tell us a little bit about yourself where you work and how long you been on the fire department\nAre so again my name's Mike Smith I've been with the Phoenix fire department now for coming up on fourteen years I'm I've been a firefighter down at station one a engine to for the last ten years I'm a married my wife and I have been together for Eighteen years now\nWe are we've got two kids ... and ... and nine and seven um we've got to now three dogs at the house um [noise] and uh\nYeah when when we're not out hiking and doing stuff with the family doing coaching football or my daughter dance and ah we either be out fishing with my buddy Brent or just out hiking the mountains back behind our house\nVery nice so you mentioned pets and that's actually what we're here to talk about today you actually have a new member of your family\nYeah so uh about three weeks ago I went back to Pennsylvania and picked up talent um use a yellow lab about eighty six pounds he's a he's a really big yellow lab and he's he's my new uh search dog and they use the newest member of the entire department search and rescue dogs that we have um [noise]\nSo the search dogs uh that we have with Phoenix they they worked for the future of our department and they get deployed\nThrough Arizona task worst one and uh we use them to deploy to natural disasters hurricanes ah\nEarthquakes tornadoes that sort of thing and also terrorist attacks are dogs were there nine eleven they were there at Oklahoma City they were just deployed to ah North Carolina for the hurricane that was back there um so they they get used a lot\nToo so they are part of the team\nYup yeah they're they're part of the team we have twelve dogs on that team a Everytime our task force airs on task force one gets deployed they take dogs with them that's part of the deployment model is having those search dogs and we have two different disciplines of search dogs in our program\nWe have our human remains or age our dogs which find people who are deceased and we have our life fine dogs which is what I have and what what the majority of our dogs are\n[noise] so what made you want to get it get searched on\nSo that's one of the beautiful things about the Phoenix fire department is the bunch of different opportunities are available to the members of the job and this is something that I've always been interested in but when the kids were really young was really hard to be a part of it because it takes a lot of time you know there's\nYour training every day with these dogs and I have to have him down at the Academy of the special ops academy\nDoing his rubble searches and building searches two to three times a week especially as a puppy 'cause he's brand new and he needs to he he needs a some finer training um so I've always wanted to do it\nBut what kind of pushed me is now my kids are older so they're able to help and there are a part of the program too so they're they're helping me train 'em at home my wife's helping me dream at home so we we basically have more time to do\nThey're able to help and there are a part of the program too so they're they're helping the train them at home my wife's helping me dream at home so we we basically have more time to devote to this program\nSo when you talk about having a lab I think if a dog that does wants to do nothing but play is that like Palin is like yeah\nSo that's and that's why we only have labs on our task force or because of their play drive so that's how we train our dogs is you know we have a victim down on a down a whole lot of rubble pile on a house we're not\nThat victim has a toy with them and so that the labs know when they go to find somebody when they find them now it's playtime now I get to play so you know it's funny when we have our dogs with us and we pull up to the academy the training academy the dogs know where they're at\n'em so they start barking and going crazy 'cause they know now is the time that we get to play and work at the same time\nSo so it truly is work but they they view it as they get there is a reward for the work that they do\nFast food and that's and that's that's what makes them so successful at at this discipline is because when we send them out to a building or rubble pile or debris field\nThey're not looking at it like we are they're not looking at it like you know there's danger and then there's you know possibly going to be a cease people or you know people who are really injured they're looking at it like hey I'm going I'm going to have fun today because I if I find somebody I get a toy you know it's so that that makes them search harder to make some search faster", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city":
