on your old vocal filler standbys\nHum a or maybe you're just hesitate and stop talking altogether\nThese are what Michael er regard calls and verbal blunders and just fluency\nOr art was intrigued by this phenomenon and how it infiltrate our everyday lives showy investigated and laid out his findings in his book hum slips stumbles and verbal blunders and what they mean\nOne thing he found out is that we all stumble so some of us are better able to send a message than others\nAre certainly people who you know when they say these things some of them do it well they make a ton natural and they use to fill the pause as a kind of punctuation I've heard announcers on television do this quite a bit\nAnd there are other people of course who said between every single word and that really annoys me but I quit admired the first instance I don't know what I Am quite good enough\nAs a speaker to be able to do it I don't know if it's deliberately maybe that's just a matter of style but it is true that everyone does have their own baseline level of this fluency\nDoes fluency is a name for hesitations like oh man oh to get an understanding of why they creep into our speech or aren't soon as you have to know how we talk what's going on on our brain and our mouth work together it might surprise you to learn good we don't speak in sentences\nSentences are something that will be more familiar and writing rather than speaking what we're doing when we're talking is that were assembling groups of words and sometimes those words group of smaller or larger units\nAnd there's a basic architecture to those phrases and to those clauses that we sat in our minds for\nOn line first and then we go and we select the words to fit in that architecture and then we associate the sounds with those words so it's kind of a linear process you know one thing that happened than another thing happened and another thing happened\nSo we plan what we want to say the phrases in clauses than we say they're simple enough but ... says that sometimes things get a little jammed up on the assembly line of our spontaneous conversations\nNow in the process of planning what to say we can't speak at the same time we're most of us find it very difficult to do both of those things simultaneously and so we plan and then we think and then we plan and then we think\nIn very fast cycles fractions of seconds but still they're cycle and we're kind of moving back and forth between planning what to say and then actually saying it\nAnd so the other phenomena are these moments where we are alternating between planning and speaking or maybe wherever you get stuck in a planning phase\nAnd so we fall silent maybe or we decide to fill the silence with a little sound sometimes it's an a or um sometimes it's a word like you know or well\nThe problems will buy some time off work to listeners that we are done talking so please don't interrupt it also gives our audience a little insight into our mind working speaking of insight there's another verbal mistake that's been touted as an unconscious look into the deepest recesses of our mind the friday and slip\nYou could describe what the flip it and say well these two sounds swaps with each other or you selected the wrong word and you asked for say a condom instead of a condiment\nThe forty and part of it is where you come in and you say why did the person make that flip with that word when that seem to produce\nSome kind of meaning that we can interpret as having some sexual innuendo behind it or having something slightly salacious or obscene or having something slightly hostile\nThem there is the ... in his book or ride offer some examples saying equivocal when you meant to say equivalent or Tim Marines instead of trampolines\nWhen we hear people make verbal selects or use a lot of ... and ... there's a tendency to think they're not very smart or that they're hiding something from us around and says the evidence points to something else\nSeems pretty natural to want to come to pretty broad sweeping conclusions about somebody based on the way that they're speaking or they lying can I trust them are they smart enough to do the job that I've asked them to do\nAnd things like that and all of the reading that I did which involved a pretty massive search\nThrough the literature in which there is an attempt to try to link to his fluency and slipping behavior with certain kinds of personality traits\nWith pie cues with education level with all the things there's no reliable link between them so what I conclude is that the ... the particularly is a pretty good indicator of state\nSo someone state of mind someone's emotional state they're not very reliable indicators of traits intelligence character leadership a tendency to lie for instance\nAnd to use the fluency in that way really starts to border on a kind of linguistic discrimination where you come to conclusions about who someone is essentially based on the way that they speak\nIn our segments on viewpoints we usually score about all the ... a long pauses and six of the tongue our guests to make for the sake of time and to keep their answers flowing\n... suggestion that we try an experiment that our listeners decide for themselves if editing has any effect on what they think of his speech so Syria's continuing his thoughts on the perception of truthfulness and verbal slips and fluency searched the edited version\nNotion of what is considered truthful is now I think becoming a little more like just natural talking with so little have hesitation to have an arms and it as well now you're just as there is a stereotype that people who are speaking\nFluently aren't telling the truth or maybe who are educated there's a stereotype on the other side which has just as dangerous I think which is just because someone has hesitated\nSmaller government but in its place we have bigger business that can be just as potent of a force in people's lives and when it's geared toward profit rather than the public good you have situations like today a moment of historic wealth inequality when the c._e._o. of some corporation and make like three thousand in time and\nThe salary of the workers on the floor and so on so that's one piece of the puzzle I think it's sort of these impenetrable system that an individual doesn't stand a chance against in many ways\nThe second main issue smart pointed out was how our healthcare system often places poor people in positions of disadvantage\nDental care in this country is incredibly difficult to access for people in poverty and actually the Affordable CARE Act that was passed in twenty fourteen\nAs a kind of compromise to the other side of the aisle removed dental policies from that coverage as those somehow the health of won his teeth is separate from the rest of water body and so\nThey're a lot of hard working people to labor sixty hours a week then end up with a cavity that goes on treated and my dad and in this group he ended up with an infection up into the route that turned into step to so essentially he had blood poisoning\nFrom what could have been treated originally as a cavity\nAnd so for somebody like my dad who don't look like the famous shiny pearly white straight teeth does the same and celebrity that we idolize in this country\nLet's say that he did everything right according to the American dream he worked as an honest man\nAnd let's say he gets laid off and then he needs to go find another job he goes into a job interview and because of the person interviewing him holding classes and use essentially or ideas about my dad's tape looking like something that they associate with\nDirty people he doesn't get the job and then says he doesn't get the job he can't afford to get his teeth fixed\nWhile her book explores these issues and more it's also written with a defiant pride in her childhood ... society expects a poor girl from Kansas to feel shame that's why she reasons terms like red neck and white trash or thrown around so pejorative plea\nBut ... says those so called red neck tendencies led to some of her fondest memories for instance the time her grandfather rigged to canoe to a pickup truck and drove the family through the snow for some thrills in a flat area of Kansas\nThat's a story that you know I had such a special place in my heart and yet it is something that someone would look at that let's say that the portrayal within a movie it would be like oh there's some redneck\nOr to

you for joining us today we would like to take this opportunity to think ... broadcasting for allowing us this window to discuss what is happening in public safety sharing emergency response safety tips\nAnd discussing issues that pertain directly to the health of our community and the firefighters who served as communities\nToday I Would like to welcome introduce our guest today we have Brian show is a deputy fire marshal with the city of Phoenix luck and brand welcome thank you\nSo tell her guess a little bit of a little a little bit about yourself on what you do what your profession is and how long you been doing it\nWell I've been a fire inspector with the city for prevention since two thousand two so as far as we go around the city and respect every building that is in the city of Phoenix so every store every restaurant whatever is building was we got there inspected make sure it's safe\nOr recently I was just promoted and now I'm a deputy fire marshal congratulation thank you and my new role um is kind of ... ah first role is I'm In charge of the special hazards unit and that you'd inspects anything that has to has materials\nSo facilities are installations that have passion materials my group of wealth or inspecting to make sure they're safe and done correctly\nIn addition I'm also the ... public information officer for fire prevention and in that role I go out and speak to the media to media events and doing interviews to talk about fire mentioned related topics and that's kind of where we kind of first met I think is doing a couple of trainings when we first started as back in the good old days with the ... exactly\nAt the CIA training and something that we're actually going to talk about today is something that we also did as PIN is about a year ago\nAnd our topic today that has ... has to relate to fire prevention and what you guys do is haunted houses right it's Halloween it's the season it's another thing that you also have something to do it when it comes to safety safety\nRight now it's Halloween season and a lot of people not me like a hundred houses like to be scared it's something that they really like I'm not a big fan but that they like to do not me either [laughter] yeah we ... the last time we did is yeah we both are scared as we're doing our interview 'em and it was like six o'clock in the morning and there was nobody inside the haunted house\nBut what we want to make sure when our stands as in the city of Phoenix was only to approve foreign houses some measure understand to approve that's it and that's fear farm which is on the west side and an eighth avenue McDowell and then the thirty four which is at bell and twenty eighth avenue\nThose are the only two approved permitted haunted houses in the city of Phoenix\nSo any other haunted house you go to means that they're not approved by the fire department and we've never inspected them\nAnd what we kind of look for these haunted houses are safety features we require a lot of states features for a hundred houses\nAre one of the first things require fire sprinklers in the fire service we love fire sprinklers and especially haunted houses because if there's a fire the sprinkler will kick on April water on the fire and control of fire enough or we can get out safely gives them more time to get out\nSo if you get on a house that doesn't help our sprinklers and there's a fire that fire can spread because there's nothing stopping until we argue as firefighters get there and start putting water on it\nAnd you can imagine how important that would be thinking about having walked through the thirteenth floor it's amazing there and you're very unfamiliar with it so sprinklers they would actually go off to put out a fire like you said allows people to get out the fact that it's dark and it's unfamiliar to the gas that are attending the haunted house a very important piece\nYeah in addition like you're saying more things that we require fire alarm systems so if there is a fire you know they're not ... did you see on the walls are going to activate and let her body and inside San house no hey\nThere's a fire its time or another merge is time to get out and the best thing about these haunted houses that we inspecting approve is they've got a system where if the fire alarm goes on\nAll the music all the scary music and all of a scary characters that aren't real um they all stopped and the lights come on when the fire alarm kicks on so that people can can now here the fire alarm going off\nThe lights come on so everyone can see everything around because you know they're really dark and was haunted houses because they want to be scary as possible is when I'm like I'm\nI'm so that ... you actually see how to get out in addition to scare guy that you just walk by the just scared you in case of merge see now he becomes your I'm way out he's going to stop get out of character\nUp to get out of character he has a flashlight they all have flashlights required by code and they're actually going to help you and walking to the nearest exit\nThe biggest thing that we find in these on permitted haunted houses is using only two exits where you start and where you end uh so if you're in the middle and something happens of fire a panic whatever it might be", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year":
