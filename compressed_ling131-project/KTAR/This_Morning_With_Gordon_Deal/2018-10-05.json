A. R. bloom gab\nRight and you might call him a Chuck Todd but a producer Jason just referred to him is Cyril ... sir Charles of the time I think he's been wants to do much games a game of Thrones a chocolate [laughter] demolish\nI Wish it takes to get night it\nI Know I Know you know I'm a moderator meet the press of course and the NBC News of political director I guess I'm just trying to kind of start with a little bit lighter mood here because I just feel like uh if things are just\nWow they're um they're\nThey're a little crazy right now in our country people are are taking their own personal experiences and projecting it onto the national news and emotions are running high\nJak I remember there's a time a few years ago when I was doing political work I actually asked my wife how would you feel about moving to DC 'cause I thought I might get a job and in in a congressional offices or something and she thought she thought it'd be pretty good and I am now I'm going yeah I'm so glad I didn't uh it is crazy back there isn't it\nWell it is but I let me assure ... fit all the crazy really is concentrated in like a four block radius and they\nUh kids went to school today as normal the buses worked fine you know I mean you know we we you learn to compartmentalize when you when you live in a company I always say this about watching it at the company town\nFor better or for worse and so yeah when you're in you're in and just me that's why I asked my wife had made a pledge a million times when we're when you're done we're done\nRelieve in this place [laughter] you know so it is in that sense you know it can be all consuming you can't you can't escape\nYou go to your kids softball game you go to your kids baseball games you can't escape it so in that sense it could be considered\nOh absolutely and you know and we're one month away from the mid term elections or you know with Brett Kavanaugh and all this going on how how does a break Kevin ... affect the mid term elections or the fact that we have a three point seven percent unemployment rate low since\nNineteen sixty nine is at play a much bigger part in how people are going to decide to vote this this next month\nI you know look I this this election season has been defined by the ...\nRight it it sort of was defined by him\nIn the number of Republicans had decided those who decided that re election you know he's he's a polarizing president either\nAs I you know when you when when you elected disruptive force and that's what he pledged to be right and that's why the people that love love the disruption that people that don't get angry by it so I don't think anything changes in as far as the mid term a larger picture the mid term but\nI think the Kavanaugh nomination has at least you know one thing that came to unite the right Supreme Court\nAnd there is more than just anecdotal there is some evidence that shows that ... of Trump voters are more engaged right now than they have been before and even some non Trump Republicans are more engaged on the Republican side of the argument than before so\nI Do think it's possible we look back on election night\nAnd they say you know Democrats were in the house but the Republicans hold the Senate that we can safely say calving off this cabinet that they said the Republican Senate for joy it's possible because when you just look at the map Claire McCaskill more vulnerable today than before this having a\nDebate started for instance in Missouri just to pick one I think for instance Martha Mick Sally has is I'd be financially pulled to even with Kirsten Sinema based on a much of the the the\nUh background polling I've heard a lot of that being attributed to sort of galvanizing the rights of\nOf of cabinet so you do see it in that sense but when you look at the battle inside the house for instance they have enough having an impact on that side\nOf right yeah it yeah and ... said here on Katie are uh just recently that she would have voted yes even though she was a victim of sexual assault in high school she would have voted or she would vote yes for Kavanaugh and in cinema just put out a release saying uh she you know so they're split on that one right there which is\nYou know it's it's more it's playing here in the Arizona and likes\nIt is and I think you know Arizona in very met in ... in in many ways is is emblematic of the divide which is you know there's there's two types of battleground states there's those that are that are evenly divided because there is a twenty percent of the metal that or go back and forth and then there's some swing states where it's basically\nIt's because there's two equivalent political basis essentially they cancel each other out a small group of voters metal Florida is that way\nRight Florida is not a persuasion state it is they get get your people at stake\nI used to Arizona's a persuasion state\nI'm starting to believe that may and I think here since ... just tried to run a campaign assuming that but it certainly looks to me like it's turning in more to a ... state in which each political base cancel each other it's a small sliver that decide the election\nAll right to make sure you're catch Chuck\nTodd and meet the press seven AM Sunday on channel twelve and there are repeats later in the day on MSN [noise]\nIt is five forty nine fact struck
