purpose it's exhilarating\nIt's not so much the chance to be horrified that makes people go to haunted attraction though Armstrong says it's more the element of surprise\nThat when I go into art attraction I'm not\nTruly afraid of honor to traction but if I open myself up to observe\nIs going on around me I can be startled just like anybody because that's the key aspect\nAlmost anyone can be startled him as sudden shock someone jumps up as a loud noise something unexpected happens and that almost anyone can experience that and that is a thrill you have a rash of adrenaline afterwards you feel good\nIf you're scared and it's something truly truly horrifying that's happening to you that's a bad feeling you know that's a feeling where you're like sick in your stomach\nBut when you get startled\nAnd immediately you realize you're safe and you laugh it's a great feeling\nArmstrong as in the business of scaring people with his haunted attraction you can find them in almost every city in the country this time of year whether it's at an amusement park or an old house but what makes a good haunted attraction nice days\nTo the haunted house going public in general people just love a traditional haunted house where it's scary it's fun and these days has a very high production value the modern attractions you see the\nOffer amazing special effects it off a projection spinning tunnel incredible characters lots and lots of actors lots of excitement so when cooking an attraction I suggest you will for one that really\nHas the production value that really you can see what it's about it's like going to a blockbuster movie you know look at the marketing materials drop your friend and pick on that he was good for you\nEven the experts can be scared at Halloween as our guest can attest to\nI get scared by mundane thing that gets scared by rain on a busy night like scared by things that make it hard to operate by business I'm not afraid of the darker particular critters or any of that it's more a\nMore mundane things that people in business for ... I'm afraid\nZombies things but that's probably my scariest and then\nI I Love Walking Dead and at the same time downbeat freaked me out\nZombies they don't even exist in real life\nStarlet says that psychologically people are more scared of things they don't know about than the real things in the world for links and more information on all of our guests visit our site to viewpoints on line dot net or show was written and produced by Evan rough studio production\nBy Jason ... is our executive producer Marti Peters\n\n\nViewpoints returns you just [noise]\n\nWhat are you going to do with your old car you can try selling it you could junket or you can donate it to heritage for the blind your car will be towed away for free and your donation is tax deductible just call one eight hundred eight three five one for seven eight\nHeritage for the blind accepts cars vans trucks in boats it doesn't matter if you're a vehicle runs or not it will be towed away for free and you'll be supporting those that need help\nHeritage for the blind as a nonprofit organization that helps the visually impaired live fuller lives\nCall right now to donate your car and it's a special thank you you'll receive a free three day vacation voucher to over fifty locations call heritage for the blind right now call one eight hundred eight three five one for seven eight\nDonating is easy and your vehicle is told away for free plus you'll get a free vacation voucher for donating call now one eight hundred eight three five one for seven eight that's one eight hundred eight three five one for seven eight\nWelcome to culture crap we examine American culture what's new and old and entertain [noise]\nIt's the week of Halloween which means it's the time of year to get a little spooked luckily\nNetflix has your back earlier this month Netflix released the hunting of hell house attend episode horse series loosely based on the novel of the same name by surely Jackson\nThe series follows the crane family two parents and five children over the course of multiple timelines we watch their time spent decades earlier in the hill house a creepy old mansion they moved into in an effort to flip the house and we watch them in the present day\nWe know from the onset that whatever happened back in that mention it wasn't good and it still haunts them even now\nIt's a scary show and there are moments of pure horror but mostly it builds a lot of suspense it's also really well done family drama it features sibling rivalry mental illness drug addiction it's like this is us crossed with the shining\nWhere many horror shows can feel like they exist just a gross us out with Gore did this show feels created with a purpose it will suck you in a thrill you and haunt you\nPerfect for Halloween week binge watch\nThe hunting of hill house is available to stream on Netflix now I'm Evan ...

would like to take this opportunity to think bundle broadcasting for lying is just went out to discuss what is happening and public safety\nSharing emergency response safety caps and discussing issues that pertain directly to the health of our community and the firefighters he served as communities\nToday I Would like to welcome in introduce our guest rehab captain Jake ... from the Phoenix tight apartment ... thank you\nSo tell I guess a little bit about yourself where you work and your role as a public information officer for the next fire department [noise]\nWell I work for the Phoenix fire department and the capacity of being the public information officer I've been on the fire department for about Eighteen years and worked as a a firefighter in many neighborhoods throughout a Phoenix\nCurrently in my position as a public information officer I have the responsibility to uh respond to large incidents and share with the media a little bit about what's going on I'm In front of them what they see what's going on behind the scenes just to offer that perspective\nOf what our firefighters are doing on those large incidents what they can expect any safety tips that you know might result from an incident that's going on those sorts of things are really just to help folks understand what we do as a fire department and and how some of the incidents that they see 'em are evolving\nAnd so one of the topics that were actually gonna address today is really kind of right and that will house we talk about safety tips\nFor the community and they come from an emergency response side of things so we're going to talk about Halloween safety right and this is this is October and trick or treating is just around the corner on October thirty first so\nGive us a safety catch we talk about Halloween I Know you and I had this conversation about there's a couple of white tells things that people are just automatically bring out when we talk about Halloween safety tests so let's get into that\nRight absolutely are ... everyone who I spoke to about coming here today and sharing some of these types of have brought up\nThe old wives' tale of a razor blade in an apple and um you know it it does speak to being safe around this time of the year it's a fun time of the year to great activity for families neighborhoods and especially children love it when they get to be able to dress up and and go around their neighborhood\nUm but some of the things that we like to stress about staying safer around Halloween time and and trick or treating is is to make sure in general stand groups of too you know so we are strength and numbers just like in so many other situations\nAre in our lives but in this situation where we're out we're visiting strangers homes in many cases you're just out with a lot of other people it's a really good idea to make sure that you're in groups or to um to that end with kids who are under fourteen we recommend that they be under a adult supervision at all times\nUm other things that we talk about as as little kids not letting them get out and go trick or treating on their own\nUm you know a responsible adults should be with them and just make sure that they are um you know supervised even with our older kids it's a really good idea for parents to kind of know which way as my kid going what's the route that they're that they're traveling so if if we have a family emergency unrelated to\nWhich way as my kid going what's the route that they're that they're traveling so if if we have a family emergency unrelated to a trick or treating I can quickly go on to retrieve my child so that I can go do whatever I Need to do but also of course just for the safety aspect to kind of knowing where they're at in the neighborhood\nUm another good tip especially for the older kids um reminding them two are not going to any strangers home also kind of have a time where you you expect them to be back\nSo that you can you can plan accordingly and react accordingly if need be um and then also just make sure that they're staying in a neighborhood that they're familiar with\nHopefully that's a well lit neighborhood and that kind of brings me to my next point is the ability so we talked about flashlights we talk about costumes that are easily seen\nAnd so something that you know I think this goes along with many other topics that we talked about on this show when it comes to safety if he don't think it will happen to us and we don't think it will happen to our kids and well a lot of these safety ... just seems so simple and we probably don't pay a lot of attention to land\nAnd you have us an interesting statistic that will back it up for a lot of what we're talking about here today\nRight exactly and and really you're alluding to the idea of a traffic incident so as you can imagine on October thirty first kids are out families are out trick or treating in the neighborhood and yet we still have
