becomes more and more difficult just to find seat assignments um another thing that happened this summer and and the best of curiosity and concern is that a\nFair number of families are reported that there are there she has got changed on them and at the last minute now this happens all the time um\nTo some extent um but the thought that you take a five year old and move them ten rows away from

that's happened because of equipment swaps um so you put your feet on on one airplane and now because of storms and I think this is one of the reasons\nIn fact this is one of the reasons why this happened more this summer it once did a lot at switching around the point is trying to stay on schedule that can create problems if the feet map doesn't match up [noise] um\nAnd now you got to move
