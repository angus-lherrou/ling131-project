reformed broker and it's my goal to reaffirm what you know to be true\nAnd to challenge the advice you may have been told is true and if you're listening on one of our five Phoenix affiliates hope you are having a fantastic weekend\nAnd you know as I like to say in life there are really two faces related to our money in phase one we worked for a money but in face to we need our money to work for us right at least that's how it's supposed to work and in a world where we are consuming information at work speeds it is more difficult now than ever before to take your life savings\nAnd have confidence clarity and not suffer from what I like to call information overload and we have a fantastic show plan for you today and it's on surprises no one of the interesting things is my wife Brittany love surprises\nYou may be someone who loves surprises I Am not someone who likes to be surprised and throughout the course of our marriage have had to tell my wife\nI Know that you think this is going to be great to surprise me\nI don't like surprises they don't energize me they make me anxious I'm not as impulsive I'm not as spontaneous so you're gonna love this this past week I received a text message in the middle of the day while I'm at my office I receive a text message from my wife but says\nHoney I did something pretty stupid\nPlease don't be too mad at me\nAnd then she goes silent she goes dark I texture a couple of times you know I'm thinking did we drive a car through the garage door like did our house flood right it was really rainy I'm thinking back to her house flood\nWas a window broken what could this be and she only other thing she takes me a couple of hours later she says will just blame it on the kids so now my interest is even more peak tomorrow what his\nSo I pull up to my house and as I pull up to my house on the way home from work I'm looking as I'm driving down the street and I'm looking at the garage doors I'm looking at the jeep that's parked out in the driveway ... is is there something wrong with the G no the garage doors look okay and I open the garage door and I pull in a park and\nAs I Walk to the door in the main part of our home\nThere is a sign that are seven year old cruise has drawn and he's tape this large oversized paper on the door going from the garage to the house and it says welcome to the Hague instant farm every farm needs a dot dot dot\nAnd he had stick figures drawn a dad of mom of back Shay cruise they a Jew or five kids maverick er little golden doodle and then he has a dot dot dot and I thought what could this be\nSo I open the door and as I Walk through the kitchen my whole family sitting in the family room with kind of a interesting little suspicious grand on their faces and our four year old says his\nDad we got a pig and I said wait what and she said daddy we got a pig and I look and she is holding this Piglet that fits\nBasically in the two pounds of our hands and its snorting winking and I look at my wife and she's bright red and I said hey what do we do with a pig and she proceeds to tell me pigs or the new family pet\nThey're smarter than every dog breed they're actually surprisingly clean honey she's going through the whole list I mean we have over an acre this things just gonna walk around and with our twelve chickens and with our dog and it's just going to be a great addition to the family I said how\nLong do they live ten to Fifteen Years so how big does it get yeah as soon as I can be a little Piglet forever and she said well fifty sixty pounds this is a truly on a pig\nSo it's different than a pot belly apparently I haven't researched pigs I'd never given pigs a second thought so I said well see you just made a commitment for ten to Fifteen Years of our lives with out asking me which my wife said\nWell I knew if I asked you you'd say no and of course this is also why I Love my wife I chuckled and I said are you five is like you\nKnew I'd say no so you just went and did it without asking me and she laughed and said yes exactly I really wanted this little Piglet and so did the kids in a promised them get the point I've been rambling here for a while but I promise I'm getting to a point here how do you make good decisions and avoid being ...\nSurprised because hey it's one thing to be surprised with the little Giuliani Piglet out in Gilbert, Arizona you know it's not fun what's not even somewhat humorous is being surprised with your life savings\nHaving things occur that are completely unexpected that you were not prepared for and to them to focus on for specific areas that you do not want to be surprised\nWhen it comes to your life savings the first is taxes the second is fees that your pain the third is risk way more risk than you thought you had and the fourth is income if you're in retirement you don't want to be surprised that the incomes not going to last or that it's not there for you\nAnd I'm going to unpack all four of those things as we work\nDown the show before we jump into that if you are unfamiliar who's Keystone well partners who are you John So I'm the founding partner on the managing director of Keystone well partners we are in independent the only credential group of ... we are registered investment advisor for meaning we do not\nSection now I've been asked before by somebody you when you come in and do the retirement Matt with us and chat with us about the show somebody will say well why that section on eating and health and and they didn't have anything to do with\nOur finances well yeah neither does my wife surprised me with a Julie on a Piglet which I talk for seven minutes about on the first segment but here's why I talk about health we need our health\nTo enjoy our wealth but let's face it if we do a great job with our money but we're not healthy enough to enjoy it down the road what purpose to doing a great job with our money really serve\nMost of the things that you care about require you to want to be alive\nRight in the extreme example and to have a quality of life it allows you to actually do some of the things that matter to some of the things you want to do maybe traveling to the grand kids you're gonna have to be healthy enough to get on an airplane you're back can't hurt so bad that you're not able to sit on an airplane from here in North Carolina to go see your grandkids\nIt may be traveling with their spouse it maybe biking with your spouse and motor homing and vacationing it might be golfing bowling I don't know what it is but in many cases we're going to have a whole lot better life in a whole lot better retirement if we are healthy enough to actually enjoy our retirement\nAnd in keeping with the theme of surprises I wanted to give you the five foods that are surprisingly not is terrible for you as you thought\nSo here's the foods you love to eat that are surprisingly healthy number one dark chocolate I mean let's face it I grew up on Willie ... and the chocolate factory I Love that movie what did the guts to scoop love right he may have been on something I mean that Augustus loop he may have been actually a little smarter than we think because\nObviously over indulging in chocolate isn't the best idea I mean it's got a lot of sugar but dark chocolate does appear to have some antioxidant effects and you may have already heard this right now by the way I Love cherry picking I'm totally data mining right now because I Love dark chocolate\nThat is my thing in the evening time I break off this um oh it's called chocolate bark you can get it at Costco they come and a bunch of different flavors their dark chocolate and when my wife says man take it easy John on the dark chocolate I mean a lot of dark try oh lots of antioxidants\nIn fact this is a surprisingly healthy food and of course my wife laughs and says there may be some antioxidants but it's still a ton of sugar to which point I kinda just shrug off and break off another piece of my bark\nBut it actually also can improve lower blood pressure\nImprove vascular function in the comfort your soul the night after a break up I mean you remember way back in high school what are you women do when you have a heartbreak up or you watch a savvy romantic movie you grab the chocolate right well I'm not suggesting by any means the chocolates healthier than broccoli\nBut if you're going to eat chocolate go dark chocolate number two red wine may surprise you put a glass of red wine actually guards against heart disease thanks to the antioxidants now\nAgain this is a touchy subject right I mean there's a lot of people that have a lot of problems with alcohol\nAnd I remember watching about ten years ago Dr oz was talking about these balloons out in the world and what he was doing was evaluating these areas of the world where people lived ridiculously long lives relatively average across the world and he wanted to evaluate what within their lifestyle in their diets is contributing to them living alone\nAnd frankly the number one thing which has nothing to do with the five surprising foods that\nThat are healthier than you think is that there was a lack of stress\nStress is so detrimental to our health I think we know that but these places were very laid back sleepy villages in the Italian countryside and\nIt was a lot of time spent with family and a lot of ... in the middle of the day and just a much more laid back lifestyle than what we adhere to in America I mean some of your listen to the show\nAnd it's real early in the morning you may even had to work I mean we live a fast paced lifestyle and that's just kind of part of being an American but at least if we are mindful of it we can try to guard a bit against it but so here's the thing with red one doctor I was also found that almost all of these villages the citizens like within the village and within the areas of the world\nActually consistently drink red wine now\nHere was the big thing 'cause I don't want to misspeak here what Dr I said that I thought was really interesting you said all these places have wine with their dinners and occasionally with lunch but here was what they did they poured a very ...\nThey poured a very small poor of wine and they had one glass\nAnd what Dr oz made abundantly clear on the show was that while one glass of small glass of wine on a nightly basis with your meal can be very very healthy for your heart and actually lengthen your lifespan the problem is how do we drink in America\nFor the most part you know you go to a nice restaurant and you get a decent bottle of wine and they pour this little tiny bit in the very bottom of your wine glass to let it breathe 'cause it's a nice full bodied red wine\nAnd you almost kind of look at it I mean I had my wife before we go out and and so that's kind of a lame poorer like I I mean I get like let's just get a cheaper wine and get a little decent poor here and so the reality is once you even go to a second glass of wine or your first poor is really healthy for you know you go to the keg and you say give me the nine ounce port\nIt's not healthy it immediately goes from being good for you to very very bad for you for a bunch of different reasons and I'll just stop there on red wine but it can be healthy when done in very very small moderation number three chicken wings\nI mean let's face it chicken wings are basically required by law or in the middle of football season yeah the cardinals stink but let's face it her chicken wings are required by law\nTo be consumed while watching sports I grew up in a sports obsessed family and you better be eating some chicken some chicken wings while you\nAre watching sports but here's a good thing\nI mean if you throw the wings on the grill maybe even remove the skin now you're getting really healthy I mean you could argue that's not even American anymore if you're watching football with grilled wings with no skin but they do provide a good source of protein so you do get some protein a number for my kids are gonna love this is popcorn here's the good news remove events\nThose you don't like bringing your souvenir cubs send your T shirts which I guess harkens discontinued now but you know your loyalty T shirts and you go to the movie theater and you get that thing of popcorn we all know when you doubts that thing and layered butter because you know what I tell my only go to movies about twice a year three times a year my kids go all the time when I go there like you want butter I go layer it\nI heard somebody in front of me that totally knew what they were doing one time say layer the butter say layers about it that's what\nSo what they do and I mean this is total free advice here on a myth bussing with the snow well partners has nothing to do with your finances but it's really important stuff probably more important than your life savings\nHow it'll layer the butter on the popcorn at harkens you tell them to lay or what they do is they put about two inches of popcorn and their\n... run it through the butter\nTwo inches of popcorn run it through the butter\nTwo inches a popcorn run it through the butter I mean if you are looking for something that it's surprisingly on healthy do that okay but if you want to be a little healthier maybe avoids the movie theater butter on your popcorn\nBut here's a one good thing about Bachmann especially if you air popped popcorn three and a half grams of fiber per serving which is actually pretty good so you know if you can ditch the butter and avoid you know the super sugary kettle corn seasoning that you throw on top of it on your way into the theater it's not as bad as you think\nAnd number five Guinness now I'm not trying to encourage you to drink wine and beer are we've already established the alcohol isn't the best thing for you but certain kinds are better than others\nAnd beer well it was a good chance you may like and if you're going to indulge any way take comfort in the fact of the twelve ounce Guinness contains them you're a hundred and twenty calories which has barely more than any of the other light beers and in my opinion Guinness is my favorite type of beer\nThe extra calories are definitely worth it so again what are the five surprising foods you love that aren't as bad for his you think dark chocolate red wine in moderation chicken wings\nAnd if you grill on and take the skin off\nPretty much not chicken wings anymore popcorn ... no butter I Know I'm totally ruining this for us right in the last thing as Guinness which I guess is good and you know what I just spent an entire segment talking about foods but a promise when we come back I'm gonna get back to the surprises of your finances which is the whole point of the show here\nAnd how do we avoid being surprised with their life savings\nAnd in particular related to our taxes related to our fees related to our risk tolerance\nAnd our income and remember if anything I talk about on the show even movie theater popcorn is of interest to you you'd like a retirement map review you want to come in and get a one page roadmap that overviews your entire financial situation that is what we offer here Keystone while partners we have offices in Chandler as well as Scottsdale\nAnd we are a group of reform brokers who left broker dealers who left banks who left insurance companies took less money to do so gave up the commission's gave up the kickbacks because we knew there was a better way to do it for you and that's what we're set out to do here accuse Noel partners and if you want to do with hundreds of other radio fans have done and request a second opinion from us\nYou can do so any time I go into Keystone wealth partners dot com go to our website you'll learn more about our for him to go to Keith do uh partners ... we make it really easy there is a button right on the home page that says\nI Would like a retirement map of you click on it and a member of my team will give you call Monday morning and schedule a Fifteen minute phone call with one of our credential financial advisors that allows you to share whatever's on your mind whether it's how you take the skin\nWhether it's how you take the skin off your chicken wings and you're concerned about that because you heard me talk about it or whether it's we just had the biggest tax reform since the Reagan Administration and your advisor hasn't even reviewed your tax return because unfortunately most of you listening have financial advisors\nWho have failed to even provide tax plenty for you in the ten months since the greatest tax changes since the Reagan Administration remember these are your quote unquote financial advisors where's the financial advice let's just call them investments sales people\n'cause that's what most of them are doing that's how I was trained to do it when I was with a broker dealer that's not how we operate here he's still well partners we are set out as an independent\nRegistered investment advisory firm so that we can work directly with you and get all the middlemen hands out of the cookie jar something that's not healthy for us that we all can agree on\nYou know what you're all in Costa is\nI mean you realize that most of what your pain is completely internal we had a client come in and I've used this example a couple of times on the radio show because it blew my mind we had this happen all the time but this is one of the most egregious we had a client come in perspective client called off the radio show called our number one eight hundred seven six seven Fifteen fifty nine that you hear me talking about\nThat's what this person did that I Want to retire map review and talking with her she's been with their advisor for fourteen years and she said I'm paying three thousand dollars a year she had a million dollar portfolio she doesn't pay three thousand dollars a year which by the way was the only part of any of her fees that were line item down her statement\nSo it makes sense she looked at instead I'm paying three K here that's what I see here it is on my statements do you what she was pain when we went through her entire ... twenty four thousand five hundred dollars per\nYear in her cause she'd been without advisor as I said earlier fourteen years Gino how\nCrushing that was for her to go oh my word how long have I been paying this you should know what your fees are\nAnd then be able to evaluate the value that you're getting for that seat and if there are areas that can be reduced very easily and you could receive the same type of value but keep more money in your portfolio what do you think that does your likelihood of success\nDeer growth rate well it's massive you take away this huge headwind that was one of the primary reasons I left my broker dealer and started Keystone when you have a bunch of middlemen who need to get paid who are for profit businesses\nWhat do you think that does the clients and feeds their way higher you got a bunch of hands in the cookie jar as I like to say when I started keys though and I said I'm getting all the middlemen hands out of the cookie jar I'm going to work directly with my clients\nHelp them create purpose for retirement\nDo a great job on the investments and minimize costs as best we can\nAnd that's what we're set out to do so when I retire ... if you'd like to come in and get that retirement ... that you've heard me talk about it's our one page road map that overviews\nYour entire financial situation we're going to look at your feet in addition to taxes\nIn addition to saying hey we just had the biggest tax reform since Reagan here's what you can be doing and we will mapped out for you specifically what you could be doing to reduce taxes were going to look at your fees and expensive suit and make sure you know what you're paying so you're not driving off the car lot surprised at the sticker price so you're not looking back\nAnd going what am I going to pay my advisor for the last twelve years that's interesting I had no idea let's figure that out now\nDon't let a nurse or take over don't procrastinate on this\nThis comes at no cost and no obligation we have offices in Chandler as well as Scottsdale so it doesn't matter where you live around the valley\nYou can get to us reasonably easy come in and get a return properly for mostly it'll be the first time you've ever sat down with an independent the only credentialed new Sherry who's not

with us\nWe don't let your concerns and objectives right on the map and we'll put our recommendations as to what we think you could be doing to improve your situation and you'd be the judge\nWhether you want to act upon that additionally we're in for your retirement income projection whether you'd be okay in retirement will your income hold up can you get more income and are you taking those income distribution in the most tax efficient manner possible\nEspecially in light of his great tax reform maybe even more importantly will help you answer the question what rate of return you need on your money to accomplish all your goals blessing will provide you on your retirement map review is a stress test we've got a nine year old market historically every five or six years we have a very market\nTypically we have one correction a year typically one out of every three calendar years the market's down in the market still makes ten percent a year it's phenomenal but\nWe've got a nine year bull market you have too much risk maybe you've been concerned about all that you don't have enough or if you're sitting with way too much in cash for fixed income\nBecause you're trying to forecast when it's going to drop and that's probably ... you while you're waiting at the market goes higher and higher and higher\nWill look at your risk tolerance and if that's appropriate for what

the program thank you for joining me off mic busting with Keystone while partners on your host Jon hits a number of foreign broker and it's really my goal to separate myth from truth so that you can do a great job with what you've worked so hard to say but in a world where we are consuming information at work speeds the research shows us it's more difficult now than ever before for you to actually\nDo the best possible job and make some decisions with your money you know it's interesting we have access to more information they were before\nAnd we're worse investors than ever before\nIt gets confusing and I hope this sheds a little light this program once a week gives you a little more perspective maybe you're able to take away one or two things every week that help you do a great job for me that's a win if I can encourage you and others your life whether it be your face or\nPursuing your goals or any other things maybe eating healthier exercising or whatever else we talk about on the show that's my goal is that in some way your life's improved by listening to the show and I apologize 'cause sometimes you just have to listen to me ranting about random things like the Julie on a pig\nThat my wife brought home and surprise me with that I wasn't expecting\nAnd that's what prompted the content for today's show 'cause I thought you know I hate surprises I just hate surprise and you know most of our clients hate surprise us especially when it comes to their life savings\nAnd so we've talked to already on the show about don't be surprised with your taxes we just had the largest tax reform since the Reagan Administration when's the last time your financial advisor reviewed your return if you can honestly tell me my advisor hasn't looked at my return since December when we just had the biggest change in taxes since the Reagan Administration\nFire them I Know it sounds harsh but you're paying a financial advisor and I am putting up air quotes\nTo be your financial advisor and give you guidance\nAnd they're more interested in selling you non traitor reads and variable annuities and all these other vehicles that make them commissions rather than talking about how to reduce taxes sort of a surprise to get ready for the price of your lifetime when you're sitting in twenty thirty\nAnd tax rates skyrocketed and you're looking back on two dozen Eighteen through two dozen twenty five going wow why didn't I Do X Y Z with my money\nAnd you'll go oh yeah 'cause my advisor\nWho was really awesome it's taking me golfing and throwing great Christmas parties and selling me a bunch of investments that they never talk to me about tax because one they're not an expert intact and to it doesn't make them any money to talk to me about it and since my CPA just basically files my taxes they never call me in the middle of the summer and share with me ideas of what I can be doing on my taxes\nYou're basically if you're like most Americans you're totally going about this alum that's one of the huge things we do on the retirement ... review and what we do for our existing clients within their financial planning here in Houston well partners\nIs discuss your tax strategy in some cases the most impactful thing you'll do with your money if you're like most Americans you probably think about your portfolio most of it's an IRAs and CSP isn't fourth reviews and for one case and a bunch of different accounts that you're going to have to pay tax on between now and the day you die and it's Seventy and a half the IRS is going to make you take money out and pay tax on it\nWell right now we just had taxes lower in the midst of twenty trillion dollars of national debt any Social Security crisis was underfunded if you don't think taxes are going\nIf you don't think taxes are going up over the next Thirty years from where they are today you're out of your mind and in light of that if they're not going to go down what are you doing right now to hedge against that if you need to know that go to our website accused or partners dot com\nClick on the button that says I'd like a retirement preview\nAnd schedule what hundreds of others have done just

fees and expensive that's what we just talked about before the break\nMost do you have no idea what your pain because most of what you pay is internal and hidden and unless somebody breaks it out for you or you read every word of every prospectus that comes to you in the mail which I Know you don't you don't know what it is\nSo what's the third area that I don't want you surprised when it comes to your life savings risk\nHow many of you were surprised in two thousand and heat your accounts with down a little more than you are comfortable with what about all one when the dot com bubble burst they see as you get near or into retirement are typical client around here he's around sixty years old when you're sixty years old do you think you want to be surprised by having way more risk than
