[noise]\nYou might get some perspective now with Bruce CJ and family use\nGood morning to you and a happy ... almost surely Monday around\nGo ahead and show off talking about what exactly happened a Senator Flake last friday so we'd\nRide your bike burn ward off the U.S sixty and makes you drive senator\nJeff Flake explaining his recent decision to request one week FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOriginally said he would vote yes to confirm Kavanaugh following his hand accuser Christine Blasey Ford's testimony\nOn friday though like announced he wanted to lay the vote for one week to allow for further investigation like telling the Atlantic on Saturday he felt unsettled and the hours between the original decision and later request and he appeared with Chris Coons on CBS is sixty minutes last night so [noise]\nYeah pretty uh pretty amazing I mean you can turn around too as well pebble in I I don't speak view we mentioned this or that\nPossibly a little calculated just throw it I mean with him for like ... there are things have happened for reasons but um\nIt was decidedly a pretty sharp one eighty on friday that's surprised a lot of people even those of us here in Arizona who knows Senator Flake who know kind of his background\nBecause friday morning as we're heading into after the day of testimony Senator Flake office releases a statement and the statement says ... to to moving forward\nAnd then there was the Senate Judiciary committee that was talking about Brett Kavanaugh and whether or not it should be confirmed Republicans had their statements Democrats had there's an while this was all going on\nSenator Jeff flake was growing increasingly uncomfortable ultimately deciding to a request a one week limited scope investigation okay so they're not all here on Cape Cod are for you last friday in depth and after the show I\nI'm going to say we're watching it on TV watching this happen people walking around the room we didn't know what was going on\nWas talking with super producer the museum and and my big question was what changed\nWhat change from the moment flakes office sent out the I Will vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh yeah and the moment he says I Will not vote to confirm unless there is a one week FBI investigation happen\nHe talked to the Atlantic and in it just like actually answer that he says I don't know if there was any one thing\nBut it was just unsettled you know when I got back to the committee assault a food fight again had to be done between the parties like the Democrats saying they're going\nBut now it appears as though there are some limits that are being put on this and not necessarily opposed to them but I think that these are discussions that we had\nSort of the world are directly or we are the focus specifically on allegations ... Ramirez it's unclear severe with the permission from the president ... witnesses evidence\nAnd my new identified witnesses I think what you're getting there is if the FBI goes to somebody at Yale okay and her class and they're talking to them about the Deborah Ramirez situation and one is Deborah me that is the one in the room where he apparently exposed himself\nTo that was the number two on the list of women Iraq and\nThe person who is you know said to be in that room goes I don't remember that situation with Deborah Ramirez but\nI have a friend who says this happen right so are they not allowed to investigate there because the typical law enforcement officer would then investigate that new leader reporter would investigate that lead and ... a lawyer would investigate that lead are you saying that the FBI camped well\nThis is the this was the part where it sounds like the two different things and I don't understand how they can both exist\nHow do you do a full and thorough investigation into these allegations\nBut also limit your focus in scope at the same time like Pamela you just said and and we've heard this from law enforcement everywhere you go where the facts take you you go where the leads take you if they start going quote unquote down this path I have no idea what they would fight may be may find absolutely nothing\nNow I have no idea what an FBI investigation entails I'm just going off you're alive and kicking you know that you're going to be like the FBI did investigate you know Anita Hill's accusations into Clarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One that investigation took\nThree days when you hiding Senator Flake and senator Coons squish into a telephone booth [noise] I'm with a cell phone on speaker in between the two of them\nThey were talking to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein on the phone and they asked him what the FBI be able to conduct this kind of investigation within a week\nRod Rosenstein said yes okay I don't think they're going to turn anything else up than already out there but yes in from all I've listened to from political pundits as well as former FBI agents I've heard that yeah we should be sufficient they must be really good to be able to do it\nWell there's a lot of FBI agents also not just going to sign up for like one guy right you\nKnow going on right now we've got a president the United states Donald Trump who that is being asked a lot of questions about trade because he's made he's announcing a new trade deal with Canada but uh as ... are asking questions you can imagine\nThe FBI interviews have come up and just moments ago here's what the president had to say about the FBI and interviewing all potential accusers take a lesson\nI think they should interview anybody that they want within reason but you have to say within reason they should interview but they should also be guided and I'm being guided by what the senators are looking for because they have to make the choice\n... I don't know what that means I don't either it sounds like both ways but I get it though I mean\nI don't know anybody but I understand you're up for the ones they don't [noise]\nI I understand that at some point in time you've got to\nLike cut bait fish you got to put a period on me and he hasn't exactly the can't go on and provided ... so I think that that's what the president is trying to say I'm not going to hold his hand to the fire for that statement and we really learn much from it but at some point in time you do have to wrap it up but traditionally [noise]\nIn law enforcement\nYou wrap
