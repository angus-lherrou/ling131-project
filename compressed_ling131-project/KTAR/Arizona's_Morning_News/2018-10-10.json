margin of error over the last few weeks or both the governor's race holy mackerel he ... he has a Seventeen point lead and this\nThe governor's race over [noise] ... yes it's the short answer the governor's race\nIs over you know the the poll that really matters is every candidate refers to begins today hot ballots live ballots on kitchen tables around Arizona but this is Seventeen point spread with the governor's race\nIs a is the fruit of a very well run campaign by Doug do see who's benefitting from uh some great decisions great economy\nThings are going well and some serious missteps by his opponent David Garcia who threw in with the far left of his own party for whatever strategic reason and and this is the fruit of that Seventeen point spread it may be wider them that uh when the salt counted\nYou know what's interesting is I was talking with a a Democrat yesterday and an elected a Democrat or who was a little disappointed in in ... the cheese are kind of told the\nThe moderate line as much as she has a she has to stay in that space doesn't she to ah stay in ... in competition with Martha McSally\nYeah that's the only way here since Senate can win a statewide race to the U.S Senate district everything to go right because Democrats have a distinct disadvantage in general elections in Arizona and\nThings are not going right for her now that two big things one is the Green Party candidate who's on the ballot is taking four percent or so of the vote and that that comes right out of the curious and send them a column ... and and she needs every vote she can get to win and the second thing is\nThat having a circus led by Senate Democrats was so ugly and and\nAnd unfair that most Arizonans that actually vote felt like they needed to be they they need to be with the Republican or need to punish the Democrats for that action not reward them and send them as paying the price for that\nSo let's talk about we're talking about stand Barnes

talk about the same for Martha McSally [noise]\nNo they're they're both whether they want to be uh in in leading the race\nWhen the uh when the ballots at the table or\nThe kitchen tables and so no I don't think there's anything to do to mess it up maybe ... if if anything Doug juicy is a disciplined on message guy and he knows why he is governor he is not going to deviate from those messages and they're going to continue to run advertisements painting\nDavid Garcia as crazy left and\nAnd winning the race because of it when it comes to me Sally\nShe needs to keep on doing exactly what she's doing which is this slow and steady thing that's going to win this race she has natural advantages as a Republican just as the greatest resume of anyone running\nRunning for office this year with are female fighter pilot thing and sitting congresswoman and all of that so\nShe's also an incredibly hard worker and you you you if you're meter\nAnd so she's going to continue to be on television the in
