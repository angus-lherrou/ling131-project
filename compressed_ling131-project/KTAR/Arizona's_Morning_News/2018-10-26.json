makes you drive by first\nWe saw it in the morning off with explosives device number eleven meant for former national intelligence director James Clapper being discovered follow suit by device number twelve found for congressman Cory Booker and now we have in our west\nOf Florida Man in his fifties has now been taken into custody just outside of Miami for his connection to these mail bombs that have set that have been sent to several democratic leaders and others critical of President Trump\nPresident Trump is expected to speak about this developing story at any minute and we will carry them life where you hear on KTLA are\nNow or an hour ago the story Pamela was that there were new uh devices discovered I Wanna see we're up to twelve twelve right um which was quickly followed with a tweet from the department of justice that they have a suspect in custody\nSo let's talk about that suspect here's where we currently are\nSuspect was arrested in the Miami area where authorities also took possession of a band they covered the vehicle with a blue tarp the suspect was tractor was cellphone investigators also recovered a laptop and other electronic devices from the suspect the arrest comes after law enforcement officials intercepted no fewer than a dozen packages around the country known exploded\nThere'll be FBI treated each suspected device as if it could have\nSo the suspect taken into custody in a place called plantation Florida he was apprehended in a parking lot\nOf what looked like an auto zone like an auto parts store this it was a business he is in his fifties CNN is now reporting that he has ties to New York and a criminal history that authorities have been digging into ever since he has been on their radar\nHe has been under surveillance authorities have been watching him we don't know for how long but for some reason this morning they decided it was time to act and move and they got him in that parking lot and he is now in custody\nYeah I'm a ... is this the end we will we will find out I think it's fair to say that if law enforcement\nHas a suspect in custody in the suspect's vehicle uh that we understand that um they hopefully are relatively confident that there are no more of these devices are that they found most of them\nAnd if nothing else stop him from sending more we do know\nThat yet because the devices this morning for both James Clapper as well as Cory Booker it's unclear\nIf they were part of the original batch that started with George Soros ... Obama and Hillary Clinton or are these a new batch and as more time goes forward Bruce that's where this\nThe ... and Hillary Clinton or are these a new batch and as more time goes forward Bruce that's where this becomes\nMore concerning because if you remember the anthrax scare the individual who sent the anthrax through the mail so much time had passed that they learn how to develop their ... technique better to make it more deadly and five people died in that instance with this we know that all twelve devices have not\nSo I suspect and and I'm not on the inside anymore but I suspect that\nThey may have identified a suspect even sooner but we're um you know being investigated things that they do twenty four seven uh to get to a point where they could go to a federal judge in ... which\nClearly they did and they have in the custody the big question that's out there is why\nWhat is the reason behind those 'cause it just doesn't make sense of doesn't pass the smell test\nWell in in a again do we really appreciate your time today to Miller president of lying hurt international services group and former Secret Service agent someone who was involved in investigations like this we are learning or we believe we have a name a of a fifty six year old ban from Florida\nWho has a criminal record um he's vehicle was impounded it has a lot of a political slogans uh pictures by the way have threats on the on the van itself\nIt strikes me that this person\nMay have been on law enforcement even local law enforcement's radar and using a lot of things you just talked about the unexploded bombs throwing them in the mail this guy may not have been the most stable person to begin with and and it's almost like you wanted to get caught\n[laughter] yeah British you know you bring out an important point at an all out of the questions is still unanswered why'd you to do it well the Y. and a lot of cases because are mentally ill um people like this farce\nSpurred on in a big way by the political climate back and forth and unfortunately we're we've talked about this there's a rising tide towards violence are and when you see stuff like this happened and you see congressman school we shot at\nA softball field and you see all of these things are indicating the rising level of violence the last thing and you\nWould in the world you want to do is for someone on that's already mentally ill to do something\nLike this now even the I'm In ... it but\nEven with all that's gone on it still doesn't make sense because you have to be relatively intelligent to put a bomb together that works you have to think through the strategy and the schemes\nYou have to be a focus individual on and what you believe on in in in what does that make sense to me is is why would you do all this simply no you're going to get caught now he could be back mentally ill to where he striving for the attention but I'm just glad that you know that the investigative efforts were effective\nThey were quick and now they have the suspect in custody of the one thing you do have to\nConcern yourself with is others like him that\nTheir thought process as it is well if he did it then I could do something equally\nDangerous yeah that is definitely a concern for I think quite a few people are speaking with Tim Miller president Lyon heart international service group and former Secret Service agent and Tam I don't know have you seen the van that was taken into custody\nHas seen it briefly on the news it clearly looks like this guy didn't hesitate shares\nPolitical private real quick for for our audience because it's radio you can't see it out you you're you're imagining like this just regular van and all of the windows are I say blacked out they're covered with political stickers of some capacity and\nThey seem to be supporting the ride and denouncing the laugh I'm being kind to really with this description\nBut it's a band you can't mess every single inch of these windows have been covered with these stickers when he was arrested in the parking lot as you can imagine you hide cameras from news helicopters over showing this and we're getting a site on it but as soon as somebody made the decision\nTo cover that van with a big blue tarp in fact driving down the freeway right now that tarp blew off they actually pulled off around to put the ... back on it tell me what you can decipher from the fact that somebody made a conscious decision that\nThere's evidence here we need to cover this so that others can't see it\n[laughter] yeah that's a that's a great point ... let me just say in in law enforcement\nIt's very typical for them to cover crop\nOf crime scene evidence it is what it is um it it certainly could go towards motives you know hey he's got a bent towards this particular political persuasion but that's a pretty common practice a homicide vehicles are typically covered when they're transported for evidence\nBut political persuasion but that's a pretty common practice a homicide vehicles are typically covered with are transported for evidence hearing reasons I'm In this case it's the whole thing is perplexing um because you you point out various like he had to be\nA on the scope at some level of law enforcement we saw the same thing in the Parkland shooting situation this young man had been on this go yeah here's the bad news guys the mental illness um levels in our country our our\nOur shocking or the national alliance for mental illness estimates between fifty and sixty million people in the U.S are struggling with some type of clinical mental illness so when you have people that are struggling already and they fixed themselves could causes like this\nThis is the result and unfortunately the question that we always ask is how do we stop it while it's for people to get involved\nYou know he noticed something if you if you hear people began to really spout\nOff the CIA notify law enforcement the bad news is is in the Parkland shooter case that doesn't always mean it's that's the problem\nYeah Tim thank you so much for your insight into that I can Tim Miller a former Secret Service agent president light hearted national services group ... tweeted the a picture of the band\nOr you can go check I ran out actual\nNow and this is not from today this is from a guy to solve this band in traffic I thought it was unusual when a van pulls up you covered in stickers and and the guy even said this is just looks weird\nSo we now have those you can go check those out on a
