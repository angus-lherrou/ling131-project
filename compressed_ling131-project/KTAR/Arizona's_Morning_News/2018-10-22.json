over into Mexico how far into are they into Mexico\nFor pretty close doesn't ... as they marched about twenty miles yesterday was\nPretty horrific actually it was hot Ninety degrees or so really humid um people were collapsing or one girl she was ... it it it was pretty harrowing as it makes you wonder why these people are willing or this kind of separate and most people told me that whatever they left behind it\nCan't be um nearly as bad as what they face ahead\nAnd I'm sure it like with any group there is always bad people mixed in but you know we know from our conversations with the field director for ice here in Phoenix the the\nThe picture of the migrant has really changed a lot of families are that are coming up and they are they're looking for the border patrol once they get here they're looking for asylum they're not looking to run from the border patrol so they can go get a job somewhere in the U.S [noise]\nSome of them but that's what's so interesting about this particular

never seen anything remotely this big um that carries with it some humanitarian questions how do you feed these people um where are they going to the bathroom I mean the stench in the square where I Am a ... pretty intense at times if you walk by certain areas because\nThey're real facilities for these people do showers\nThere where I Am and have a ... pretty intense at times um if you walk by certain areas because they're real facilities for these people do showers so it's a major question of what is going to happen to them over the coming days we'll the Mexican government allow them to proceed uh all the way north we just don't do that\n[noise] yeah we're we're ... we're talking with the ABC News is that government who's in the top of true in Mexico with that the giant migrants caravan which the president has been talking an awful lot about talking about actually sending the troops to the border to deal with it\nDo we have any idea what part of the U.S border they intend to uh go to will be California Arizona Texas do we know that\nIt really depends on I I think they're going to split up at some point soon you know the U.S border with Mexico is obviously enormous you know we're talking about two thousand miles there about ... and they're still at the very closest about\nFourteen hundred miles away from the morals Texas a\nNearly two thousand miles away from the ... or farther than that I'm from you want us so\nThey had a long way to go and again you know we're we're talking about families here I'm not all of them but they're\nYou know thousands of women and children in this caravan and after yesterday I don't know how much farther they can go I Can't imagine people keeping up this space in this heat are very much longer certainly walking the two thousand miles but\nUm they have displayed an incredible amount of fortitude and it's unclear how are they are willing to go what is clear right now is that the Mexican authorities don't know what to do with them we saw\nHundreds of riot police deployed yesterday blocking the road and when the migrants approach they retreated and they did that twice yesterday and now they still don't have orders about what to do with whether to block them here in the city of ... or let them keep marching\nSo All right so that's a that was ABC's Matt Gutman joining us this morning from a top of true love Mexico
