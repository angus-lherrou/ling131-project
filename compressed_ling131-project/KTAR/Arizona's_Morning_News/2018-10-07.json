are you OK edit it ain't just wonderful\nI my question today ... ... ... ... ... about four or five years old about eight or nine feet up in there that are very well get started in earnest faith in the end of the early\n... perhaps a little pruning right now a Leslie and they shot a fertilizer and it should perk up you know this rain is actually ... wonderful for it really kind of washes off the spider mites and spider might cause the Italian Cyprus the most problem if anything here in our little desert and dust and guess what it's going\nTo get ... and that okay if I ...\nWell if you want a transplant and move but what I Would just wait for probably another month or so anytime a type probably after the middle of November ah between November in late January be the best time to transplant it it it's probably a little early to do it right now\nOkay All right ...\nWell how large diameter is the trunk on yours Leslie\n... it's probably about eight or nine feet tall they made the ... feet\nOkay so it's fairly young Indian so you'd probably want to how long has it been planted as president location do you think\nAre probably about five years okay\nSo you want to take root ball it's going to be like Eighteen to twenty inches wide and he always deep probably twenty inches deep\nAnd uh and they do transplant fairly well I Would say wait and do it like mid November on and then I pick up a product called super thrive which you can purchase anywhere and it's like vitamins hormones but it really does work and you know I was with my friend one Mercado down enough\nAnd he's really quite a character he's transplanted plants all over the world and he was telling me when he was doing these little seedlings that he was bringing out of the jungles\nYou know these little trees what he would do is actually crush up some aspirin\nAnd mix up some aspirin in because he gets the alpha they asked it out of the aspirin and that he found that to be a great thing in assisting transplanting as well\nSo he would say actually aspirin and you know for his big thing is seedlings he would smash a few bottles of aspirin and it basically dot solve the roots in it but you know it's probably a good shot you know to get rid of the plants headache give it a shot aspirin to\nSay thank you thanks Leslie you too Bye bye well\nThat leaves us was wide open phones you know it's kinda

things at work or very effective at all and ... and it's kind of a timing thing\nBut you know right now is the ideal time to kill it you know this is the time of year when those plants are storing search up and they're not you know when they're going to go slow down for the wintertime so let this rain get over as soon as it dries out don't well what's your ... get as much hype that you can\nAnd hit it with a real heavy dose right now and it'll take more of that down and store it and be more effective this time of year\nThan any other time and then if you don't get help maybe follow up with

again until\nThere's not much you you know you should get a pretty good die back he was the ... camera takes two or three weeks for it to really melt go down it's not really rest in contact or so\nYou know you're you're pretty much the good application right now you're through for the year and then see what comes back up with this spring and then when the warmer temperatures in may you don't really

sunshine 'cause we were in a mobile home so it's a small why but the problem is maybe it's just because of the latest scientists you know getting to\nThe French are on the south or the north side it's growing too um they\nAre they're ... they're going to grow to take advantage of the much sun as they can say they're going to grow towards the light wherever they are planted and when you're not going to really change that you could prove them back some and make the plans for more balanced but they're not actually going to grow towards the light and you know they just might not be the best choice in those shady area is\nThat what it said this time to um get thrown out\nWhile you know you probably you could you don't want to prove them now they're young plants because what you print backs not going to regenerate you know normally when you're going to prove them as you leave him till it's you know kind of Ross time or they go dormant in the winter than proven before they start to grow in the spring\nIf you want to print them a little bit for shape you can do it any time but they're not they're pretty much finished growing for the year now\n[noise] oh okay All right well now wait a while then\nJoy and where they are then you know if you if you do have some more light you know you figure out of the brighter spot you might you might transplant them in the spring and about it\nOh April or so [noise] okay transplant in April thank you all have a nice weekend All right thank you for your information or join your show appreciate called by by oh let's see uh Jackie if you're going to be up next but I Will not\nGet a ride the end of the break here so we can talk a little bit about\nAll the beautiful things we can do I do hear the raid was a perfect time to get out plan a vegetable garden flowers if you're going to trigger guard is over right now you probably want to incorporate a little bit of ships have been to um if you want to be organic you could throw in some blood Miller Bode Miller perhaps of chicken manure\nWhat you could do is you go ahead and print it back moderately right now and you could fertilize it with a full year fertilizer like a ... or twenty twenty twenty\nSo that it had something extra to pop and grow on right away and using one of those water soluble on the phone which is going to get your fastest return on some foliage to fill back and so\nYou didn't go ahead and print it now but just keep in mind that doesn't have a long time to grow it's not like pruning you're going into the you know spring so it's only going to really grow for another three or four weeks five weeks and then it's going to kind of stop and be dormant for the winter time\nOkay so here's miracle grow\nGrow would be perfect just a full your application a miracle grow would be ideal\nOkay and uh what about um flowers um [noise] oh I Can't think of what they're called\n... flower planting season you know from geraniums petunias pansy snap stocks all the kinds of beautiful flowers we can grow now is a great\nWell I had some growing in there they're blooming but can I cut them\nBack or they ain't gonna or what would it be Dinka\nYes you have a summer so that gives you could prove a little bit right now and actually hitting without fully or miracle grow right now would be great as well\nAnd the ... have been around now for three years because we haven't had any freezes the last two winters\nSo normally that's planted more as the summer flour\nAnd an annual but because we haven't had any cold weather is this a lot of real beautiful big big around so if you want them to feel and look nicer you know you can share and backed by fifty percent and go ahead and fertilize them and they will fill back in or you can you know take advantage of the beautiful planting season for the more dramatic colors you can play at this time of year\nOkay All right um and fruit trees when should they be I've got Lehman\nA orange and yeah lemon and orange\nOkay and they ... him as well\nUm I just fertilized someone okay\nWell if they were just for life you know it's better to fertilize it a little earlier because they grow best when it's warmer so they're going to kind of grow for the next month or two then they're going to not even to probably six weeks and they're going to stop and be dormant for the winter time so that if\nThey if they were going to be a print and when would that\nBe the best time to prove and ... is really um\nAfter the frost before they bloom so typically we've proven them if we're going to put them heavily like in a cultivation grove situation we've proven right after we harvest in January or February\nAt home you can print them a little bit anytime for shape and form and it's not bad to print citrus right now just to kind of balance the tree out and have a look a little nicer we're not really worried so much about the sun burn anymore like we would be in the summertime\nSo you could do as a moderate printing now and I think when if you're printing sisters just keep in mind that you really don't want the trunk to be exposed to the sun so you want to have the tree fairly dense canopy and the branches lower to the ground\nOkay All right thank you very much they wouldn't have and I speak at the bank a\nBill in Phoenix getting more than a bill that morning Brian how are you wonderful\nHave a couple of questions for you I've got some yellow bow on the set\nIn my house that started off well there are a couple of years established but all of a sudden now about a month ago they started to get some waves and stuff and I don't understand what's going on with them\nWell we have little caterpillars your bag worms that have been feeding on yellow Belgian bugging the here the last three years\nAnd they show up kind of late summer and they basically are you know skeleton icing the leaves on the end of the branches so they're eating and feeding on the ends of our ... vogue and fears and that will pass you know with with the season so it's\nThey're kind of get a season out right now but what you might want to do is just kind of really be aware of them next year in the mid summer and there is a product called bt or ... what you spray on him\nAnd that's basically toxic to the worms but very safe humans and other animals and you could put that on to prevent that from being a problem next year for this time of year what you'd probably want to do bill is just a little moderate burning it just kind of lead them buffalo\nOkay good good one of the question for you I I'm not an issue with the last year now with these I don't even know what kind of bird it is but it it it seems to pick on my yard that must have been able to they have\nA longer bacon they get in the grass and they just start drilling down into my yard and it just clicked on my yard\nWell what what what what ... and\nAll that but it's this other person is true in in and get my my soil rip it on my grass\nYou know you know what they're doing the bill\nThey're eating the worms they're feeding on your grass roots\nYou know what we have is ... government come out this time of year you really don't see it but if you want to see the worms you'd have to come out at night because the worst about night and it's the old story about the early bird getting the worm\nAnd you'll probably notice they're mostly there early voting but they're eat a little caterpillar this coming out and see it on your lawn a nice little worms and so those birds are being very beneficial and they'll do any a huge paper\nSo thick thick the birds bill oh okay [laughter] I mean\nI Know they're ripping up ... but if you did a habit of birds the worms to be feeding on your grass and you've had that you have dead

uh-huh are they common\nWell there are a lot of different types of would worry beetles we are flooded headed bores here to get into a lot of our native desert trees they really attract them attack them most in may and June when the ... not flowing and then we have some other varieties of boring beetles that get into palm trees and different things as well okay\nI'm a I live in a community where we've lost quite a bit of trees and I thought it was because the irrigation and I was talking to the management company and they said that upon inspection because a lot of the tree in my opinion looked very dry and dead ... I'm ... ... but\nThat apparently the ... the landscape ... as saying that has nothing to do it than a negligence on irrigation they're saying it's all due to what boring ...\nEditor of the reason the bill would bring beetles are able to succeed\nIs that the trees natural defense mechanism is to drowned them in South so healthy ... here in the desert to properly irrigated a produces enough saps the Beatles starts to bore and it gets drowned it lays is larger than the suffocated drowned and south so\nI'm while the Beatles you know basically are the ones that are doing the damage the reason while they're able to exist is because probably as you suggested the trees are not\nGetting enough water okay that's what I thought and they mentioned that they were ... I think I'm not a ... not really\nYou're not as a model that you have to figure that I think they said that they were ...\nWell they they especially get industry to cases in Texas I've been using a lot of desert varieties and if you go hike around the desert Shelley and you see the big old uh\nFor example misty trees often times where the wood dead and it's all riddled with little holes and then you have a new branch coming back out that's because we go through drought periods and the last couple of years have been especially you know drought periods where we haven't had much monsoon and no spring rage do winter rains\nSo a lot of trees have been damaged a lot more than normal and and the cure for them nature's ... water\nYou know an irritation and it's not as critical this time of year there are still boards and they're actively feeding you know you can treat them by putting poisonous you know basically things like and I'm In a court but around the tree that make the trees toxic to the Beatles but nature's way of controlling the Beatles with rain and irrigation\nAnd you need to go out in your landscape\nSo it's a fair statement to say that it probably just weren't well a water to maintain\nThe big portion of the why the Beatles or effect heaven and eat the trees is because the trees are water\nOkay and then one other question I have you on and I'm not I'm\nGoing to be planning a tree in the backyard and de ... not really I Would help\nSoil it's more like dirt so I'm and I'm actually going to go to ... nursery and that in ... your experts there but just in your opinion on ... don't have a green thumb white hair is a good fast\nGrowing drought resistant tree um I did go to one other nursery but I don't want to go back to them but they said that that might be a good idea to do it I think it was ... by\nThe Yellowstone National gene so it's a smaller planned it's really not a large tree how large healthy for you treated gross Shelly\nI really only want something that maybe it has a canopy as maybe honestly like maybe Fifteen to twenty feet wide that said I think that's considered a small tree\nNo no no [noise]\nNo [noise]\nKnow\n[noise]\nDo you mean you have any new term\nThey um wish him on modern wake up one of them the\n... who\nWould have almost no drive zone way out bombs that Kim named Tom [noise] that's why\n\nThe the\nWould avoid you got to be one of the vote on my way of rights will be right back anyway got a\nNew light filled up with a number to call six so to to seven seven KTLA are but the next step we have pat tippy good morning pat\nGood morning science by the way I enjoy your music in the morning to well thank you I have a question I just recently\nLost the only tree in my property and noble and they left\nIt to um eat off on the ... that's my print pruning and leading and everything he said the entire tree out worked really hard on route and everything should I be worried when it plant something new that there's anything in the ground is that it's going to affect it tree\nWell you say you're lost it to beetles pat was it the the grubs were feeding on the roots or was it something that was boring into the trunk\nAnd it was part of the trunk and when I took that way I had to take the other side of the ... so it was a trunk\nOkay so you know pretty much that those were flat headed pours and they're not really going to be done in the soil with route so that they shouldn't really have any bearing on planting a nutrition affected at all\nIt's okay for the next question they asked is um are you familiar with the quiver tree\nNo no not right off hand\nOkay several years ago when um when I moved here um I joined the botanical garden and they have cleaver trees there actually that increased the number\nAnd and I've always ... relatively small drought tolerant tickets their native South Africa and I was thinking of looking around to find one to see if I could planted here but I mean I'm not sure\nThrow them don't want you know what I'm seeing on the Internet is an aloe tree aloe that would be kind of difference that would probably not very easy to grow here as a tree tree and\nOkay I'm going to grow the tree aloe to a tree tree it you know you're talking about a long long time um you know it's it's really not a tree it's more of an album but if you're looking for a smaller compact tree you might look at just a yellow Mexican burned a paradise\nAnd that will make a tree this twelve to Fifteen foot tall it'll bloom you know easily six to eight months a year and it stays evergreen unlike the Mexican border paradise it was some ... you can make a very nice compact read this drought tolerance easy to grow it gives you a lot of blue\nOkay and I mentioned that I can find just about any ...\nParadise just pretty much anywhere okay thank you very much fat by by fact oh let's see next step we have John Scott still good morning John\nWarning uh I've got some bird of a Mexican birds of paradise bushes and um what's the best time of the year and how far can you cut those back\nWell you could prove just right to the ground if you'd like to join in the best time to prove them is probably just let them you know as long as they're useful in the fall which is attractive I wouldn't turn them they're not going to really grow much more they're pretty much done for the season they grow best when it's really hot\nSo if you wanted to just prove to the ground I Would do that December January whenever they freeze back to a December January but certainly before they start to grow in March or just drop 'em right down the ground\nThank you very much shake you but by ah let's see next we've got KP over in Glendale good morning\nAnd when do good morning KP\nHey how ya doing I got a bike is crazy\nGuys probably Fifteen feet tall is starting to lean real bad how can I straighten it out\nWell you could actually uh you know just dig down beside the trunk and straighten it back up the best time to do that ... would be in the spring after the Ross just before it really starts to grow so the best time with you like the middle or into February\nAnd you could just ... trench around the tree and straighten it back to get it straight proving the head back and it'll come back and grow in March and April and feel right in and it will re route a lot that time of year\nThis time of year a few printed back and try to move it it's not going to really re route very well so that it will probably have a tendency to move again so I Would wait and do that at the end of February and a prude the top back maybe up to a third in just dig around the trunk and straighten it and if you have to embrace it leave at stake for a month or two I Would probably help as well\nThey all the way around it or just\nA way you just dig up on two sides you know we'll way from and into the lean on those two sides and leave the other real ugly attached and then just straighten it\nSafe KP by by\nA next up Carol over and Gilbert good morning Cal\nHi how are you today great\n... I have a question\nAbout the angel trumpet\nAnd how to make it thrive I I had a I've been to San Antonio many years ago and\nWalking along the river walk and smell this wonderful sent and finally figured out it was the\nAngel trumpet and I found one of the only place I've ever seen one you're in the Phoenix area and bought it and they had it for several years but really struggled at making it thrive\nWell it'll probably the best Calif you plan on the eastern exposure\nSo it gets more going on in the afternoon shaded want some somebody doesn't like our real hot reflected heat\nIt's not good right well like white out in the wide open with a gravel on if you notice where they are along the river walk there in San Antonio [noise]\nYou know they got a big cannot be a live oaks and other things over them so they're actually growing down there and it pretty shaded environment now they'll grow here in in fairly full ... but they don't want the hot afternoon sun so if you would kind of mimic that environment like you saw them in with their partially shaded they're going to perform much better\n[noise] okay no well I I Love\nThe plant they're beautiful and the smells great it just really kind of tough to to get it to thrive\nWell the other option for you might be to grow it in a pot on the patio so if you had to sell the ... audio and a large container they'll do well that's what\nThat's where I had it and actually I Would I Would kind of move it in the summer from\nYou know in the morning it would be fine on the patio kitchenette that eastern son but\nI pull up back when the sun got pull up an hot\nWell don't take full sun all winter I mean it's not gonna hurt but all the time of year until may be in full sun uh you just really need to protect and mostly in June and then also probably July and August but a ... you know the ... so they would be probably easiest grown in in a container\nNow my other question is who who carries those in the valley\nUm we typically barely Cal I'm at\nThe nursery oh and uh we usually have them in the yellow or white blooms and it's it's pretty common for us to have them I'm not sure what we have in the stock right now I've been running around like crazy this weather got so nice and we're trying to get everybody moved around all the stores but you know if we don't have much stock right now we should have been back in stock within the next week or two\nOkay well I'm hearing the guys that are then\nYeah if you stop by our Gilbert Stuart talked to ... Nancy they'll they'll should be able to help you with them\nOkay push it very much I go by by by by\nThe next step we've got Jason over in Chandler good morning Jason\nHey good morning high I got a few weeks on\nMy back yard I've had it for about Fifteen Years probably ten twelve feet tall\nA within the last couple of months it uh all the ... totally fell off or a died I should say\nIt doesn't look like it's growing anymore it it appears to be dead is are there any way that I can check well\nThey truly ethnically was Alan ... Jason and um you know if the crowds kind of gone out of the tree for it to come back we're you're caught a little later within better puts a fungus side on it back what had more of a chance to grow\nIn August or September but uh you can treat the heart with a fungus side and see if it comes back out there is a good chance it'll come back out it'll take it a year to look like a tree again\nBut what I might suggest to you is you might want to think about replacing it with a mule palm of your palm as a cross between a pinto and the and the queen palm much heartier here prettier foliage looks like a coconut it doesn't seem to have any fungus problems Neal\nHa ha ha really ... okay thank you very much Jason\nWell let's see do we have time for another caller a well probably not before they are sharing and or an Avondale in John you guys will be up next to it after that we have three open wide spoke the number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven\nAnd we could talk about your dreams for that perfect landscape is certainly a lot of fun things to grow here lots of different styles and what weather we're having right now you know really the weather could not be any better for planting so whether your dreams are planning a vegetable garden putting it's a\nBeautiful fall color or for the summer was hot do you want to put it in the shade tree whether it'd be a desert trees citrus tree\nAnd do a heavy pruning the best time to do that would be in the spring or late February so the tree can go out and re fully eight and kind of feeling better and even though it's maybe a little bit better unfold you might see some more foliage come out of some of the woodwork could've been hot enough to actually cook those branches\nThe fear is though for that burned areas on the west side of the trees the sun's coming through the tree now and hitting the wood in the trunk how long ago where did you have the raging fired his grill\nOh that tape that may July August\nOkay so the problem is now is it the wooden there has been exposed to the sun and probably has been damaged\nYou know by the sun hitting the wood after the fire a very simply the best way to really repair the tree would be uprooted back substantially probably paint the trunk of white on it the whole trunk is protected from the sun and and really what should the tree back heavily right before it's going to start to grow late February\nLate February about ... ...\nWell no I really I really wouldn't print and now you might want to go ahead and painted now and you can buy the tree trunk paint that the natural color like the park or you can buy the tree trunk white either one's fine\nAnd if you want to not to be seen words painted you could paint it with the uh the brown type of pain ideally you would have done this a little earlier in the summer but it will still help protect the wood from the sun\nTo buy that stuff although what I guess\nYou could use a water base latex would be fine there is special paint that's that's basically what's nice about this special panic comes the same color as the tree bark so you've got to have a habit not look like it's been on line let me look I don't care what you could use a white latex paint it will be fine\nI'll take I'll Try walk over here and that by ... by by uh Gary and may say good morning Gary\nGood morning Brian uh\nWherever clump of a pygmy they bombed us two of them are the biggest one is about oh I'd say ten feet tall they're looking at just ... you know but I just wondered how much do your water this it's this twenty five years old and they're still alive but\nThey don't have to be water too much you really Gary ... ones like that and if you'd water real heavy once every two weeks or hip system weekly that would be fine\nFor them by hand well water my hands great watering by hand is honestly the best way to water 'cause you're out they're paying attention to what's happening\nAround them too so you have a good well what I Would do with them right now it's fertilizer right now we're citrus fertilizer miracle grow anything you might have will be fine go ahead and fertilize them right now and water and heavy ... just run slower there for a few hours now normally rain doesn't count but\nYou know this week we've we've had enough rain to count so if you'd fertilize him in the water and McGahn right now just a nice good soaking in feeling the way I Would probably be plenty and we'll take that fertilizer down and they really got another month or so to grow and they see green up and put out a few new nice front\nOkay so you're saying uh once every two weeks in the summer or\nWinter written in the summertime once every two weeks if you're going to water them deep and that's going to be for that sized tree you know about fifty gallons of water so depending on your well ... you know accommodate them much cooler weather who are whether once a month probably fine\nOkay very good thank you thanks very ... by a David in Phoenix good morning David pay for any Yes sir\nHey listen we got a quite a storm last night and\nGot thirty seven hundreds of an inch of rain and some strong wins it blew over my FICA straight in my backyard it's planted in my grass backyard and I'm Wondering is this never happened to me before so I'm Wondering what you're you're you're probably in our our rest\nOn top of everything else and I'm Wondering now what whatever my options\nWell the best option for right now you're the reason why it blew over is probably not just last night storm but the fact that we had three inches of rain in the ground was really soft going into this you know prior but I Would prove the top of the tree backed by at least a third\nAnd then straightened it back up and it'll probably be fine it's a little cool for it to re route but um it it should be ...\nWell it has pulled some of the roots with it when it fell that set up thirty degree angle and is laying on its side\nYeah so what you want to do is you want to\nSo what you want to do is you want to you know permanent way back so it's not trying to capture as much when and replacing some of the you know the roots that are broken are gonna have to be re grown so you know proven the top of it way back you know you got some weather right now where if I can regenerate new growth for the next month\nAnd embrace it stays in place and let it ... you probably want to leave the braces on until next April when it's got a good chance to really root out better in the spring okay\nAll right so I just wonder if there was a salvageable\nSo those are pretty much you know there there are such a hearty three that they're probably you know one of the easiest trees and salvage along those lines and and that major pruning or fell back and you know over the next course of growth for the next spring and summer\nAll right we'll try that they share right You're welcome Bye bye or any in Phoenix good morning any\nLearning yes I Need some time you this morning I have had a character for a forty five years that died today so it's scheduled for removal so I'm calling is I Do have a that's\nA landscaping in my front yard it's with Iraq so south facing as full sun and so on and I do want to go that that doesn't tell you I Do not one another care so I'm kinda torn between at ... or a tip\nOn our end I guess they are in ... what is the downside of the tip of\nA that is not going to take the heat as well and with reflect the heat in the rock as I Would have him as well so that I Am with the heat will be will be really hard here you know with all the reflected heat off the rock and so they might be better choices and that I was probably the cleanest out of the group great that is\nGood news because we do have the right um so what's funny is to get there because I you know I obviously I've had in great shape pundits old a character mind\nWell yeah they are pretty slow growers so you know you might buy as big as you can afford because you are buying time you know with you by the difference between like a big Seventy two inch box street and it twenty four inch box is about ten years\nSo I mean it's wise where you are really a lot of difference in the age of a tree or you know other trees tend to grow fast like a mosquito will grow very quickly and that's the right near as long to make a big tree but you know if you like and I and what did you want that character or do you want that big evergreen look they're really hard to yeah I I Would buy a little time and they are and what\nOkay well thank you

I remember it was an August and I'm thinking it was two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did it show and I did a follow up show on talking about how people were losing trust and institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was there were only two groups and and this was before Ferguson by the way some remember that part of it or whatever that you know few months before that\nSo they re ... there were only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent and the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nAnd the fact that the military certainly deserves in my opinion are respected and the rest of it in the vast majority of cases on look you know Pentagon weighs as much money as as anybody does and then this stuff and there's\nA lot of on accountability and whatever but the people that are out there trying to do the job on the day to day are patriots and they are people that are sacrificing a tremendous amount for the rest of us and I have a lot of respect for people that that serve\nBut all that said there are implications to a democracy when the only people that the citizenry has faith in our essentially the police forces which is the military as well as law enforcement\nAnd I made the point that that just becomes a very difficult situation for us to have a guinea functioning democracy\nAnd we have to at some level have some faith in our system or our system is going to have to make some radical changes well what we're seeing is some of those radical changes coming about if we look at what's happening with Brett Kavanaugh where do you think he's innocent guilty whatever totally beside the point\nBut what you're seeing is the total manifestation of blood sport and us politics\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through on the whole cabinet thing and people's lives are going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just because I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the class I'm going to be teaching is before the crash and the ideas is classes and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach\nBut the idea of this is before the market goes down you gotta know what you're going to do when before it happens\nYou've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up but the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given us a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and telling me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realized that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble\nThey put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of game think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half okay\nIf you lost Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now\nHow is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so again in class we're going to talk about all these ideas we're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people focus on what's called technical analysis\nThey're using the indicators and whatnot frankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked winter like four okay you know you have your ... and you're ... you're a CC eyes and ears on hold for thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one\nAnd within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different lengths and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got\nThey won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two and he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right so they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now and the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes and that's a lot of this is that people used something because it's the best they think they've got\nBut it's because they don't really understand what's possible what what one of the things are really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market to supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did that would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but\nWe always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing as opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do\nWhich is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to
