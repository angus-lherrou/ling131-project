buy at a newsstand well a lot more of the news and get out of the wall Street Journal joins us now with more on how old fashioned newsstands are becoming snack destinations and is anyone buying paper newspapers or magazines\nI think at a typical news than they might be selling about five to ten newspapers a day so someone's buying them but not very many people and this is down from even you know ten years ago they might have sold several hundred newspapers and back in the fifties they might have felt thousands of newspapers what\nKinds of products have come in to take the place of newspapers and magazines\n[noise] I'm just about anything and it's kind of frustrating what kind of prompted this\nA column for me as I was in times square and my phone had died so I needed something to read and I went to a newsstand weight in the middle of town square in New York City actually labeled newsstand and I asked\nYou know I I was trying to find something to read and they didn't have a single newspaper um they have all kinds of candy and snacks and cookies and um drinks you can buy 'em your budget you can buy lottery tickets they can buy lots of different kinds of cigarettes\nUm you can by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets and and my PT um snow globe you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws governing what can be sold are there any laws that say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands um [noise]\nWere first coming up ... and these are just the sidewalk newsstands that are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands 'em a fan's veterans city property you could only sell news and\nUm it was even that it was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties the said he agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies integrate them to let them sort of like pre packaged food and\nItems that cost less than five dollars and now the console just about anything kind of food and beverage wise as long as that's packaged in any kind of like knickknack or ... as long as it's under ten dollars they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because\nI think they want to keep them as fans from competing with for a front retailers for good reason\nUm and then the city does have a law that if you're a newsstand who has to sell news and they actually said he told me they send out people to force that last but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines have periodicals\nAnd from what I've seen some new standards will you know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or well a lot of space too I'm\nSelling the newspapers the coastal margins are super low and they don't sell very much they'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and\nAnd soda things I have a lot you know much higher margins\nAre speaking with anti the end of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stores I Would think some of the stores in that area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the new stance or selling\nThat you're right but\nThis has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for you know going way back alive a long time before like you know ... came and so I think even though\nUsually the the retailers all his fight tooth and nail and then he just stands come forward and say hey we want to start at in these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia in the city and a lot of affection so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the newsstands also serve to um\nTo um [noise] it was kind of billboard for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company that um rents out the sides and back for the data for\nFor um selling advertising for the

car from Sanders and Ford was about a Nineteen Seventy four and a half ton three in a tree straight six cylinder\nBut ever since I bought that first one I had to walk by about three mustangs I've wanted a Mustang my entire life what's your favorite for vehicle\n[laughter] well you know growing up in this business of my favorite for vehicle is one from one of a built unlike you I'm a truck guy but I'm a Nineteen fifty six F. one hundred and two thousand and one of those truck or the year because we did so much restoring these on\nBut you know Rosen my first vehicle I was in high school um I didn't get to a vehicle till I was a junior in high school [noise]\nFifty eight ranchero\nAll right yeah I had a few cows and stuff and I wanted to go on a date so a put a ton of cover on the back I could hold a and stuff but also go out on a date so I had a dual purpose vehicle and it was my first customers Asian than I ever did\nEr during that time because the fifty eight ranchero had these tail lights\nAnd I thought I got to do something with that so I took sixty three fairly in ... put it in the back of the rancher fit perfect it looked like a star and everybody said oh my gosh is that cool\nDavid customer a [laughter] and later they were putting some pretty substantial engines in those and chairs and with no wait the back I had friends that could like those tires up all the way down to the to the will Bush and\nI understand that much if you're right we did some great things with it\nWhat were they put in that in that Richard\nWhere we had three Ninety three fifty twos and uh and we've kind of punch them out a little bit made them a little more exciting\nGood American but right there though for rancher Sanderson forward [noise]\nThe rosy on the house Arizona our driven by ...\nCome on and you all for that second cup of coffee the doors wide open the catches them to come in sit down and join the conversation [noise]\nThe conversation this morning\nWith park ranger Laura very Burkhart for modern Zuma castle were just talking a little bit about the castle itself tell us a little bit about the culture pre Columbian ... culture\nRight so the the culture that Occupy Central Arizona or we call the southern ...\nUm we're not sure what they called themselves obviously but ah archaeologist have a sign that name to them kids because they based on the materials that were found during the study er during the excavation of these sites\nThey really distinguish themselves far apart from the monkey on culture\nFrom uh the ancestral Pueblo in culture which many people are familiar with ... sites like ... sure that'd be the ancestral headlong culture\nAnd all these and cultures existed pretty much during the same time period but they had\nA distinguish it a distinguishing materials or certain ways of making pottery basket treat jewelry clothing but they all had a an economic relationship with each other these trade routes would extend as far west as that\nAs far west as the Pacific ocean and as far south as central Mexico um we found a I say we like I was there it was mostly the Nineteen twenties and thirties that these studies were being done first uh\nBut uh they found seashells from the Pacific ocean made into jewelry\nOr the ... the skeletal remains a scarlet ... cause I'm parrots from central Mexico that were brought all the way out into the valley yeah yeah they they were actually found all over the southwest which is really kind of interesting uh an exotic animal\nAre being brought up a for for trade really um and then uh the the culture we we believe that it was first established some time around six fifty\nA but it it really started to distinguish itself around a between nine hundred and ten fifty\nThat's when a agriculture really started to take a foothold in that valley and that's when you see these stone and clay structures start to appear uh like monitoring the castle like Tuesday cute um\nMy curiosity wants to do what what impact would be a ruptured ... crater have on these people and that was was that was the ... century I think what it would interrupt I mean basically all of northern Arizona is covered middle lava flow which makes for a great building material [laughter]\nAnd it also makes for a great fertilizer for the ... but the event itself there's the the the direct\nImpact as as far as my knowledge is ... and and the ... valley is is that part is limited for me but uh the you're right about\nThe soil being impacted for sure that a carbon deposits coming into the soil would have made it richer and more fertile\nWhich would have made it easier for a for farming communities to start forming large scale 'em and you would get hardier crops and that uh with that type of soil um\nAnd we do see at least in the ... valley uh from what I understand sunset crater it was around ten fifty that the last time that interrupted and around ten fifty that we\nUh start to see the stone in class structure start to appear so they're\nThey're ... there's definitely evidence that there could be a correlation there between this major geological event and a um a a a population boom of this uh this era and and there's there's other evidence uh\nI've heard from other rangers that work up at sunset crater and we'll poppy national monuments that there's certain dwellings that are in that area that have like an ash lines around it or over it from that time period so I imagine there is a big shift in where people lived at the time too I I imagine\nYou you look at uh what happened recently at ... national park and and not only affected the national park but it was going through people's neighborhoods they they definitely had to figure out a a different way to live and and different places to stay\nWithin their own community\nWere you divide your time between ... both of the sudden I was right correct or was built in a cave and one is built on a hilltop right but they are built of stone and mortar we're going to come back with Laura Burkhart when we\nGet back and talk some more of those we don't want to talk about the the er visits y'all have going on with these four okay yeah absolute alright it's rosy on the house do jobs nobody where\nWe're at park ranger Laurel very Burkhart for models or the castle as well she divides retire between models or the castle and mom as well as ... I Want to talk about when they put the scuba gear on and went to the bottom ... well what did they are [noise]\n\nStart and Andrew week with one dollar coffee it's they're both with many Monday and finally friday two days a week you get circle have great coffee for only a dollar any size even results of this ... at circles gay excludes ice coffee and espresso\nBring relief from uncle ... morning there were really bad acting phone if proven preventing released like rambling they're working really today in early ... at Walmart the writer and blogger in pharmacy or they're working relief dot\nCom look up in the sky stampede wanting to leave all set up singled out for every woman doing business as Benjamin Franklin Wyoming\nCircling the drain surveys valley ready to walk four hours a day every day and reliable and do a great job of thought to be funny\nAll right oh eight wants to wait maybe five that's Moreno it wants to Eighteen fifty bucks for coupons or frankly wanting VHS dot com slash coupons or five or sixty\nWell hey yo rosy here and I take pride and helping Arizona homeowners make the right decisions when it comes to repairing their household castle are gathered monsoons in summer heat wreak havoc on roast and knowing who to turn to can be a challenge that's why I recommend my friends at ... they are the flat roof specialist with over Thirty years of experience perfecting\nThey're sprayed bowl methods this three co process creates a seamless waterproof blanket of insulation for both new and existing rough spray foam bombs to everything pipes this flashing forming an impenetrable barrier that protect your home\nBoth structures are built with stone and mortar mhm okay a that's a heck of a hard carriers job to get more up to the top of the castle\nBut now the castle built the recess civil ... limestone sure cliff so you have the anchor points and you have the thermal mass you have so many advantages and then like just I don't know what is it Fifteen miles down the road it to you\nThey built on top of a little no two very opposite same culture save construction type\nRight yeah it's a um yeah there are about ... I think it's twenty three miles apart but yeah it's the it's the same valley and they had very similar resources a but their choices we believe we are dictated by the topography of the land um when you're\nAt Manas in a castle a beaver creek\nThat runs right by the park did a really great job of carving the sheer cliff and uh luckily some south facing cliffs and that\nWe we believe that that was a a a good advantage because in this in the winter sun is shining on that structure all day and then uh I'm sure as as you know is living in Phoenix\nAt night your house does not automatically cool down that heat radiates off your walls and so I I Know for me sometimes the hottest part of the day in my house is like seven o'clock at night\nOut right after the sun goes down a and then Tuesday ... ah they they had the Verde River which is the largest river that runs through that valley a so they wanted to be near it on the hill or take them out of the flood zone\nA and there are several ... close in on the west side of the valley that are up on top of hilltop like that and that advantage of not being in a cliff side but being on top of the hill is you have what we call a line of sight living\nSo you can have a visual communication network with your neighbors because everybody lives next to the fresh water source but up on a hill above the tree line you can actually visually communicate um it could have been something like smoke signals that could have been something shiny like volcanic glass\nCould have been something like um they they were really great at weeding cotton and making a making a\nFabric so it could have been something like that but they were visually communicating with each other\nAnd then all of this study you I've done of the pre Columbian culture in Arizona of all the assimilated tribes throughout the state of Arizona something happened about fourteen hundred right yeah and it was virtually state wide\nYeah you see that in in the southwest or that ... that era that there was a huge shift that people moved around quite a bit um\nThe there's a few things that we go off of to explain that time period and one of these theories could be true or they could all be true because we all move for various reasons um\nBut the first thing that we look at is the the climate evidence during that time period or we see a drought that came into that area era during the time period so if you're a agricultural community\nThat is a that's an issue as critical yeah um we also see a evidence of other cultures coming into the ... valley about a hundred years before the ... left\nAnd so now you've got overpopulation\nPlus resource depletion um but we also uh we also consult are affiliated tribes the the um the cultures that have descended from the people that lived up monitoring the castle into ... D\nAnd some of them say that that that was never really meant to be a permanent place for them any way that it was just a stopover points on their great migration to where they were eventually supposed to live today\nAnd so even though it was a a four hundred year stopover point it was still only supposed to be temporary so\nWhat we've got two in the last couple of minutes with a program here is you've got to invite people up and tell them some of the events you've got going on\nUh one of the events that I Want to let people know about a specially in Tucson is there's got to be a a is going to be an Arizona national parks festival and its Sunday October twenty eight\nAh from nine AM to five PM at Reid park in central Tucson and all twenty to Arizona national park units will be there represented will each have a booth with information and activities\nThat would be a great day trip yeah you know\nWe're really excited I'm we're all the rangers are personally excited 'cause we all email each other but we never really get to see each other very much\nSo ah so that's going to be great and there'll be music and cultural demonstrations and activities for kids and a couple of food trucks so if you get hungry you can you can have a snack\nOr read the great part of a ... great part ... park\nSunday Sunday October twenty eight\nOr mark that on your calendar Laura ... last little invite you like to get out to the state of Arizona\nYeah so I take a keep an eye out on our Web sites because ah we're going to be adding for November it's Native American heritage month\nAnd on Saturdays and Sundays for each weekend for November we're going to have special guests and events going on every Saturday and Sunday um with our with our tribal partners or they're going to be cultural demonstrators\nArtists musicians storytellers jewelry makers I'm Katrina Carver as a and it's we do it every year and it's such a great event and um people always end up uh\nHaving some really great conversations with our demonstrators in learning quite a bit about the people that have done in the southwest for thousands of years\nFantastic Laura Baron Bert cart park ranger ... castle monitors Zuma well and to\nLook for a when you see her out of the trails W herder on her first ever radio debut you did a great job thanks yeah All right so we got out of jail lead or do you heard or first right here at rosy\nOn the house so rosy on the house Arizona our driven by ...

height range\nLondon\nWe appreciate the call Dave good luck with your tree selection and planting a if you are putting\nIn a new tree like Davis and you've got to get water to it are you drip or other\n... what's your preferred irrigation option\nWell I'd prefer using ...\nYou really can improve on flood irrigation it mimics nature better than any other type of watering you do have to contain the flood irrigation by creating a ... but that's not very difficult to do you know whether it's at a three foot radius or six foot radius or a ten or twelve radius\nYou can create a a berms so that the water when it flows out of the bubble or will flood the ground a um you know over the ... over the root zone of the tree and in slightly beyond it is I ideal so will encourage route development out into the native soil\nBut yeah that that's really my preferred method of um irrigation is is using bubble or you can accomplish the same thing with a drip irrigation system you have to really like I said earlier in the program you got to really get it dialed in and the secret is to do is to allow the\nThe stations to run as long as you can you get a very deep saturation and then don't water is often you know the ... the the idea of watering for five minutes a day every day is is a terrible method of of delivering water because it just creates a very shallow um saturation and\nIt's just not as effective so and you want you want your the distance between you want the the soil between Uri emitters also to be saturated not just these little spots you weren't irrigation saturation patterns to coalesce they need to they need to touch one another so you can either run the water long enough\nSo that the horizontal saturation of the water actually touches the horizontal saturation pattern of the mid or nearby so you're getting a nice coverage of water\nSo if you can do that and you can do well hum drip is is is a is it can be a more economical way to to deliver that water but you got to do well\nAll right and it it's funny you can ask a lot of people in the opinion varies quite widely [laughter]\nWell I just don't think you can improve on flood irrigation if you can uh if you've got trees that's really the the best way truck shrub there's a lot easier to use drip of course ... root systems are so much smaller\nLet's bring a guess Barbara back on the line from Tucson I'm not
