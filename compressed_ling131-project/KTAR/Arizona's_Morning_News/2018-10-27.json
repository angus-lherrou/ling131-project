mean you go to places like the universal studios Hans and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them\nHaving no touching rule and these guys can pick them up they can throw them around they can put their hands around their neck\nBut they're not allowed to actually physically hurt them and some of the participants they leave with bruises they leave with surface scratches but they all said

out driven by vendors and for\nCommercial breaks are dangerous and I've got a calculator in a few minutes to do some numbers here's what I have\nNineteen ten when s R P is built there's two hundred thousand people in Arizona Nineteen eighty five Seventy five years later the census was recorded around three million thirty two years later today twenty Seventeen there's seven millions each one of these critical voices that right now it's doubling\nIf we keep up this patient sixteen years there'd be fourteen million people Arizona and\nI Know they've calculated number bigger than that and talking about a whole Sun Belt of Nineteen million just from ... to Douglas\nWhere's the water coming from [laughter]\nTo support the growth\nAnd we're looking at you know critical levels in Lake Mead that rationing would start is that going to solve its problems we hit rations and the developer say well I guess just just to ... thousand acres I was going to put twenty thousand homes on and make twenty billion dollars on I'll just walk away from\nNo it seems like a water flows toward money doesn't it so [laughter] so\n... drink orders for fighting listings for drinking [laughter]\nI'm happy to take a crack at your your large question which is um where's the water going to come from and that's to refer you to a really great website called Arizona water facts dot com which is our water our department of water resources\nWater facts website and there you can see that our state compared with the mid fifties our state has I don't know we went from\nA million people to seven million people our economy has grown twenty times what it was in the mid fifties and yet we're using slightly less water than we were then\nSo we it's very important for us to keep in mind that we have deep coupled a population growth and economic growth from water demand it doesn't mean that we don't need more water to have economic growth and population growth\nBut it does mean that we don't have to have a corresponding correlating increase in water we've actually been decreasing our state wide water demand\nSince uh Nineteen eighty or so and for lots of different reasons but we shouldn't have a sort of instant idea that oh we got to go find more water so that we can have more economic development more population we can we were getting more efficient about how we use water all of our fixtures and appliances use less water than they ever did\nUm we landscape our yards in a different way when I grew up in Phoenix and I think every single household and Phoenix had Bermuda grass and ... and maybe palm trees people are now taking\nDifferent approaches to landscaping more desert landscaping lower water use climate adaptive plants some of the biggest efficiencies have occurred in agriculture to when we do all those efficiencies we stretch our supplies for more people more economic development more crops per drop\nIn terms of from the outside you know you talk about that population growth just in Arizona well farmers and ranchers around the country are being told that by two thousand fifty the world population will have doubled and we have to present we have to produce Seventy percent more food\nOn probably less land than we're doing right now we're putting up houses were taking farming out of out of production because most of the time houses over the top of what was once farmland and so so it's a serious question of\nBalancing that you know if we're not going to be able to create more water how are we going to balance you know 'cause the other thing is kind of need it and then water is food and so [laughter] so that it's not it's it's not something that we should be that we should be deciding without without that consideration\nAnd cities can grow up with apartments and condos in high rises\nBut it's it's not something that we should be that we should be deciding without without that consideration\nAnd cities can grow up with apartments and condos in high rises stuff you've been for generations for generations my ... my kids are six generation so so and all of that family history not have you ever been able to vertically grow your pasture\n[laughter] I Wish we could there is some her to grow out there in a vertical farming happen actually and that will probably address some of the world food needs but you know going back to the concentration that Sarah was talking about agriculture you know even in in ... county which is what's facing kind of this this rich you know this cut back in the imminent future\nThey have eighty five percent efficiency and they've gotten to that point over the last thirty forty years\nAnd and that's a great efficiency number for agriculture they they've done that through their irrigation systems they've done that through land leveling they've done that through lining irrigation canals they've done that through growing GMO crops they've done that through um rotating crops having no till farming\nAll of these things protect the water balance in the soil and they do lots of other things and so\nFarmers are really kind of pushing the envelope in terms of what else can we do to to be able to save as much water as possible it'd be the most efficient we can with it and still actually grow food and so um so that's part of this conversation too is that how much more can can farming conserve and still produce to me that growing population demand\nDrove I drove past ... every Saturday when we're broadcasting kj art and they've got you know there are signs out in front of the dairy just with statistics about how much more they're grown with how much less water and how much less land\nAnd that trend is just gonna keep continuing that way or the efficiencies that we have in our home in an industry are going to change one of the best\nQuotes I heard was from Jerry ... speaking at a Grand Canyon university one time or he said\nThere's opportunity is in adversity lotta opportunity where I was I Would that mean is it a very diverse topics and there's a ton of opportunity here you said at the beginning of this segment about waterfalls money or money follows water whichever\nBecause I don't know about your or my family I was born in Arizona my family's from Louisiana love Louisiana miles from Memphis it's been a lot of time in Tennessee I Love both of those um loved the Rocky Mountains of Colorado have family there I don't leave Arizona\nWell and I think maybe one of the reasons people I think when things people care about the Arizona is maybe the agriculture that you can see that you live you know you live among the food production I think people care about local food production I agree and we'll talk more with Stephanie ... president of the original Farm Bureau and Sarah I'll get to\nYour title after the break 'cause I don't have enough [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nHe gave on issues that mattered if election by voting inform on November ...\nClean election commission

painting company in Arizona as well as holding an a plus rating with a better Business Bureau one of their Scottsdale customers owl\nI think we we forget about food security\nForty fifty years ago a big percentage of household income something like thirty or forty percent of household income went to food and we live in an in an extraordinary time where it's it's just a fraction of that now\nAnd we have a very food secure country there that doesn't mean that there are families that have a hard time making ends meet and getting the food that they need but compared with where we have been um in history we we are very food secure and that gives us a ...\nI'm making ends meet and getting the food that they need\nBut compared with where we had then I'm In history we we are very food secure and that gives us a form of national security so I I always bring that up I think it's very important for us to keep our eye on food security and that food is affordable if not you know without overstating it's affordability is\nMore affordable now than ever was\nI think the challenge with any of these augmentation options is they're going to be expensive and it it's very hard to know when do you start investing in it and develop it so that you do it just at the time when you have the customer base\nReady to pay for that water and that's been our challenge with CAP\nWe asked farmers to be the customer base eventually the farmers came back and said this is very expensive water we need some relief\nAnd so so CAP and the the other water users made a deal and said okay\nWe'll discount your water but you have to take lower priority and that's why we're at this point now where all the impacts would be hitting Janelle ... ag because of this agreement\nThat was really rooted in this problem we have we need a customer base and I I Want to add it we've we've been talking as if we're about to have a big water crisis and we're not we plan water in Arizona on a very long time line and we're talking about I mean the the D. C. P.\nAnd what might happen if there's a a cut is imminent and it's very important that we figure out our way through that but as far as you know Arizona goes\nThe cities were not on the verge of you know rationing or a big crisis are needing to\nYou know build a pipeline to uh the state of Washington and have an army activated to make that happen\nUm there has been a lot of long term planning and preparation for drought preparation for shortage most cities have diverse water portfolios and so they they have made plans to stay resilient in that in that in in a way you know ... county really kind of stands out in our county egg is being\nI'm impacted more than anyone else by a potential cut on the Colorado River\nAnd we have with finale or culture is the second largest producer of food and fiber in state of Arizona humid would be the first\nAnd so it's really important to the rest of Arizona What happens with the segment of agriculture and it and like Sarah said yeah I mean they're the cities have have taken these precautions and they have stored water I'm like I had said previously it is really more of an imminent loss to agriculture itself and so it is one of those questions of\nOkay because it's not you know because it's not a an imminent moment for the cities and for you know you're not going to turn on your tapping and it can run out of water but because of that\nIs there room to share the shortage then was agriculture is there room because Syria talked about that agreement that happened you know when the farmer said okay well we'll give up our entitlement to the cities and the tribes in order for less expensive water but part of that agreement was a promise and that promise was you'll have so much water\nFor so many years at a certain price well that was supposed to be out to twenty thirty\nAnd so now we're talking about well you really only going to have a portion well if if it stays is if it's being plan right now they would lose all of that water um probably by twenty twenty and so so that was a promise that was made you know so you negotiate you say okay I'm willing to give up my water\nFor less expensive rate\nBut you're going to give me water for a certain amount of time right [laughter]\nAnd now it's like ... and during that time farmers are investing millions of dollars right they've been all kinds of farmers have invested seven hundred million seven hundred fifty million dollars into conservation and best management practices and all of a sudden it's like we're actually going to have twenty twenty so that's a scary thing for the farmers\nAnd like you said earlier or it's not only the food for people but it's food for food beef is a big part of the Arizona act we'll and a lot of that it's grown to feed the beast it feeds\nA beef in theory deserve biggest that's our biggest sector and in Arizona and they depend upon that that are forged gross in ... county\nAnd agriculture's one of those things where we got rain and hey we've got a little bit of water you know that there's no quick solution and and you can't just go plant a few of them have food tomorrow for your\nNow [laughter] we can start getting real world and I say\nIt's a it's a business in science as a science based business yeah I I Do feel like um since we don't have the other participants in the D. D. C. P. discussions um it's a little bit incumbent on me to say that I don't think there is some sort of hostility for agriculture\nUm people get in these discussions who are in these negotiations that you know this is a a difficult situation for ... and that's why there are\nThere are forty people in on this committee that's doing the negotiation who are spending including Stephanie untouched\nThere are forty people in on this committee that's doing the negotiation who are spending including Stephanie untold time by a in these negotiations in other and they're in these meetings will have an audience of two hundred people who care about water and the\nDifferent industries that use water what what some would say uh is that what agriculture agreed to was lower priority and that now sort of this is the time when lower priority kicks in and that they agree to that and that's the argument that\nSome of the other users on the CAP are asserting\n'em in there and they too have made big investments in putting their water in the ground um and maybe developing infrastructures infrastructure to remove the water so there are a lot of competing needs and considerations here\nAnd I don't think anyone wants to see impacts fall exclusively on ... county agriculture\nAnd you made a statement about the three primary uses of watered down one of the race I think you should share that with\nThe top three uses of water are hydration sanitation and growing food\nYou take away any one of those and it doesn't complete the cycle you got to how they're in trouble in trouble [laughter] yup okay well we'll we'll come back at the last segment talking about just take away well what's the take away from all this we're joined with ... the director\nThe ...

an eighty by one sixty at the urban farming and it does is urban farm\nYou're supposed to be a house and like a place to park a car and drive way up in the front porch\nAll of that all of that in fact I have about forty fruit trees in the front yard and when I Do tours at the urban farm by the way we got a tour next weekend next friday and Saturday at the urban farm she can come and see it if you want 'em\nAnd I would sign up for that at urban farm dot org urban farm doesn't work\nOut when I Do tours I bring people out in the front yard and I start counting fruit trees I first start telling them I got forty three fruit trees in the front yard and they're standing in this big grassy area and they look around and it's like whoa where\nSo I'm a I Love Hedges and you know for city code the highest fence you can put on the front part of your property is probably three feet right\nBut you can grow at hedge as tall as you want so I have an apple heads down the south side of my property that has eight apple trees in it I have fourteen citrus trees across the front\nAnd another twelve citrus trees down the north side of the property and it just looks like a nice hedge\nAnd I have in the citrus Hedges I have naval oranges trophy to orange is I've got lemons I've gotten Mandarin quiet so I've got lines um there's a grapefruit that's a really nice real red grapefruit and the heads as well so\nNot only is it a nice privacy fence for my front yard that also makes food\nAnd when you're talking privacy if you wanted to double up that function you know those lines trees and those suckers has some born [laughter] yep exactly ... lines and privacy had\nAll the scenery and annoying neighbor on the north side of the property you don't want coming through\nYeah exactly so there you know that that's how I Do what I keep the trees and Hedges um I also keep them small there was a really really important reason to keep fruit trees small and it goes like this a peach tree can get thirty five feet tall and it would take up\nAnd to keep fruit trees small and it goes like this a peach tree can get thirty five feet tall and it would take up a footprint of maybe twenty feet in diameter it's going to produce four hundred pounds of peaches and a two week period\nAnd in the city most of those pieces at the top of the tree are\nToo high to reach bird food or food bird food so in urban or treating it is a whole concept called urban or treating we keep our trees small my perfectly proved peach and in the front yard is all of about ten feet tall I'll get about Fifteen pounds of peaches off which is one day of\nPeaches and it's all done through pruning so we keep the tree small and in that same area that has a ... that could have a thirty five foot tall peach tree in it I can put eight or ten or twelve other trees if I'm keeping them small\nAnd you said fifty pounds of peaches off that one and how much does a peach weight takes two or three to get to a pound probably three to a town yeah fifty pieces off of it no probably\nTwo hundred and fifty peaches a year and another armor [laughter] Jerry's over they're raising the producer Gary [laughter] so yeah but it's all in that writing is on a two week time right\nSo here's the other key piece here we can plant peaches raping from may fifteenth\nTo July fifteenth by selecting a variety type sites selecting\nDifferent variety type so by keeping the tree small we can put more varieties in and then we call that successive ripening so that's ripening over time rather than you know all the ... you know all the same peaches at the same time\nAnd that's what you call consecutive harvesting that's called consecutive harvesting light that you've always got great one or two word descriptions for all your little techniques that you've developed and goes I've been doing it all longtime refining so\nShe'll hours route stock ripening times all the time and then we'll do a lot more detail that is involved here before we just go pick our first plant stick it in the ground right\nSo here's the really important thing to know you can go into most nurseries in this town and they will sell you a fruit tree that will never make for\nSome time say no sometimes oh that's just what corporate sent us I had a a big box store tell me one time well that's just what corporate sent us and those trees are for up in Prescott anyways\nAt a big box store somebody wandering as isn't going to be buying trees for down here they are going to be buying them in Prescott at the big box stores so\nUh there's some ... and one of them is called chill ours we get about three hundred and fifty hours of chill that's and that's degrees under thirty nine to race so\nIf you were to plant a tree fruit tree that required six hundred hours a chill or eight hundred hours a chill\nWe only get three hundred and fifty here it's never going to set fruit I Know this because I've done it\nAnd those types of fruits Macintoshes are cherries you know there's a reason\nThey all come from a low bar there north yup\nColder climates exactly and by the way we have no cherry's that grow successfully her no pitch cherries\nThe gross successfully here I I Know I've tried [laughter] see that's the thing about my perjury program I have been experimenting and planting fruit trees in earnest for over Thirty years here in the in the valley in fact I planted my first for trees in Nineteen Seventy four\nThat's just when I was playing so I've\nDone a lot of your experimenting for you show the trees that come from my program or count honorable\nAnd what do you have going on today berries true value oh very surveys show a couple of times a year we open up our urban farm pop up nursery I'll be there my crew will

to fruit you program you sign up and there'll be delivered in January when they all get delivered like you mentioned earlier\nCorrect so the September through December timeframe is learning how to plant your fruit trees how to make them successful this is what I Do on line classes I Do in person classes I've got\nMy three ... your fruit trees class coming up on line this next week I've got so you want to plan of fruit tree coming up on line urban farm dot org the front page you can sign up for those free online classes takes about an hour at time and uh you know honestly whether you get trees for me or not you want to come and take these trees because you're going to learn a lot\nAnd in that time between now and the planting we've got time to put an irrigation get to design select which varieties and\nDo all do all the pre work and then when we get our trees they're ready to go on the whole exactly now on those three ways to kill you've got a a note here you're going to give us a little preview on some [laughter]\nYeah so there's two major ways in a minor way that I have seen hundreds and hundreds of trees killed first one is we cook them\nYou put them in a very hot microclimate hot micro climate has gravel it has blocked walls and you expect your tree to survive in a really really hot micro climate you don't put gravel around the base here trees it's not a mulch\nIt's not going to have your trees thrive and uh my one of my rules around planting fruit trees is a ... at least to six foot diameter base in with six inches of woody mulch\nThat is going to help so much and come and take my classes because I discovered something this year that I Believe is the silver bullet of growing fruit trees in the desert\nI'm not going to tell you today I got to kind of take classes but it is something that lowers the soil temperature in August in my front yard\nFrom a hundred and forty degrees at ground level to eighty nine degrees at ground level\nThat I think is going to be the silver bullet of rowing fruit trees in the desert that ... it blew me away the difference it made so the other major way that people kill their trees is they over water them ... so if you want to your tree and it looks a little droopy what do you think\nNeeds more water than these more water see what do you do get more water and then it was a little more and then what happens I must be really need to add a lot of water [laughter]\nExactly fruit trees in the desert if you have them planted correctly what the basins around them and my silver bullet and place [noise]\nNeed to be watered once a month in the winter and twice a month in the summer a good deepwater fill up the base them with water if you're watering more than that it's likely you're going to be killing your trees\nSo don't over water your trees and you know by an eight dollar item it's called him waste your meter we sell them at our nursery most nurseries have them follow the moisture meter if it says it needs it needs water then that's when you give a water\nAnd then the third way that's a little bit more minor but if you're planting your fruit trees in the lawn\nAnd and hang on before it gets a lot on a moisture meter ... how long does that reading take her to something just sticking the ground you have to look in the around it works just like that okay so if I got on my urban orchard mhm\nI could just carrying around from one yet as I've got citrus enrolled one that I've got um peaches and row too I've got out of ... and they're all on different ... uh\nInterest in rural one that I've got um peaches and row too I've got ... and they're all on different ... uh irrigation line that I can easily take it from one to the next right well and I did my one for each tree\nRight exactly it's just that you just carry their eight dollars just carry with you you said drip\nThat's another way so watering falls under the category a drip irrigation fall into that category watering a drip is not a great way to water your trees\nRemember I said they need to get a lot of water all at once and then dry out and between ... generally if you have drip irrigation you got a one gallon per hour driven met her and it comes on for what four times a week for an hour\nWrong way to ... water your trees so if you do have drip irrigation you need to put eight or ten or twelve emitters around the base of your tree and let 'em run for four hours\nAnd I do good and as soon as I have the time and the money I'm putting bubbles and got it because what happens when you put eight to ten ... around that eight to ten a spaghetti lines for rodents to chew up for them to break for them to live\nWe have a solution for you to come and see me at the nursery hung out today and I have a solution for you on that\nI turn it on ... I spent ten minutes for drip going or replacing parts of\nThe houses here so I got his ... I asked us down after the broadcast and find out\nNot cool um and then the third way as to plant in lawn Bermuda grass will out compete your trees and seen it happen over and over and over again so remember the six foot diameter six inch basin around your tree mhm when your planting in a lawn you want to put a dig out a disc out of the yard six inches deep six foot diameter\nYou plant your tree on a mound in the middle and you still that base in with six inches of what he mulch\nThat does two things for you it builds really healthy soil but the other thing it does as you probably have sprinklers in your lawn right mhm if you've got sprinklers and your sprinkling a fruit tree that's way over watering it\nSo what the ... does is it puts say barrier an inflation barrier in place and only the top inch of the ... gets wet\nAnd then once once a month in the winter and twice a month in the summer you deepwater your trees\nAnd then one more thing you just need to we'd walk around the edge of the base and and keep the grass out for the first year year and a half and then once the trees established your goals and\nHere in the outdoor living are with former great we have one more segment coming up on urban or treating a your goal ultimately at the end of the day when your time's done you would have liked to send you know what I taught\nPhoenix, Arizona how to grow its own fruit tree and became its own food island yeah\nThat's a great way of putting it I loved that can I use that absolutely I thought I was repeating [laughter] why are calling it a food island I Love that [laughter]\nIt's hard to stop a train time your condition exist is located in the ... get a quote on a new system or schedule service for any and all your HVAC whatever sort of brings harsh conditions you can count on trade there relentless testing is proven to withstand the harshest\nRainy the freezing temperatures to special financing for forty eight months or just gets up to one thousand dollars to qualify new trade system subject to credit approval for eligibility today details and their stretches the trade in Africa\nMilitary assistance mission providing financial support to Arizona active duty military\nWe help ... which is our lowest paid enlisted service members we pay that bill directing make sure that that service members taking care of\nFounded by Markey bonds military assistance mission provides financial support and morality to our current Arizona active duty military personnel\nWe qualify for the Arizona working for a tax credit ... because we only serve Arizona and am Asian ... dot org\nNicely some service has been keeping Arizona homeowners comfortable for over sixty years so they know a thing or two about providing their customers expert advice when it comes to installation and maintenance of air conditioning units that important with the extremes of our climate from triple digit heat chili nice this is the time to examine here you know\nThese these technologies constantly advancing and considering the age of ... it might have to consider a new system now\nAnd I said governor with terrain there your brain comfort specialist which means they must follow trains bringing standard delivery maximum efficiency reliability income for nothing can\nStop a train now with the cooler weather your thoughts turn to getting outdoors and enjoying the best time of the year [noise] but isolate phone service reminds you it's the best\nTime to look at your air conditioning systems sue did it one day and night trying to keep your cool have you noticed higher than normal energy cells now with the time to consider a new train system with plenty of time before the heat for it\nI Try to keep your cool have you noticed higher than normal energy bills now with the time to consider a new train system with plenty of time before the heat returns and more time to finance it you can buy now and pay overtime\nIsolate film service can install a new freeing system and assist with financing by giving you zero percent interest for forty a month\nAfter I see ... percent interest for forty eight months paying full within forty eight months and not one anymore in interest take advantage of this special now an upgrade to a new train system and let the experts at eyes leaves home service take care of you now\nNo worries later eyes leaves home service for ... for one eight forty four twenty two sets for a ... or one eight forty four twenty two poor ... eyes least dot com that's high S.

screening we've got to a place we bought down in midtown Tucson need some a window screens and we were looking at some of these ah security screening that they market\nUm as in how they would compare to\nLike the old brought our windows dark\nHum as in how they would compare to\nLike the old brought our windows dark right um or they are they any good\nWell the demonstrations I've seen they're pretty good [laughter] they're pretty good thing I have to say I I'd never installed any um but from what I can tell from from everything I see a ... your your concern is primarily home security\nYeah okay 'cause I've got to replace some of the screened anyway we were looking at that and saying well it's worth putting security screens on\nI don't know what the cost of them are\nI'm not I'm not familiar with either might like the ... the other thing you were considering is just the wrought iron frame bolted to the outside of the house but on why sure like the look of the security screen is a lot better than those\nAnd realtors will tell you that as well you know that that's one thing that screams\nBad neighborhood of old ... bars over now there's a way to do them decorative and make them look nice and\nUh catch some old world sculpting on the metal but that you know you're you start pricing yourself out of reality pretty quick but those crime guard screen demonstrations I've seen are pretty darn convincing yeah I that's definitely the route I Would\nI Would go and all you need to do is determined for a few seconds I mean they're not going to sit there and eat and beat beat a what unless it's an extreme situation where\nYou know they don't like to make noise they don't like to be seen a burglars in and out smash and grab you determine for a few seconds they're gone so I think statistics\nSay that the one the the number one point of entry buy a home invasion or cook is the front door so\nMake sure you got a good secure screen front door over the top of your would solid core door make sure you got good dad both with a one inch throw on it\nMakes your the screen the security screen door has non removal pin hinges in it as well has a good a boat with a one inch throw to it\nAnd Rome he's right I Believe statistically they'll tell you that someone is only going to spend about thirty to forty five seconds trying to get in your home and if they can't in that amount of time chances are they'll move on down the road\nWhat you got to remember is try and set your house up in the crime guard screens or a good way\nThat your house does it look appealing it it it does it look easy to break into a\n... they they especially like front doors that are screened from view where the neighbors can't see the front door people down the street gifts for because of a plant or screen wall or something like that make sure the front door has good line of sight for all the neighbors\nTo see it yeah splintering would sends a whole lot different than shattering glass shattering
