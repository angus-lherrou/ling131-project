you say Jewish community among ... because uh I Know there's a Jewish community in Los Angeles for example that's more of the uh um Orthodox Jews ... with with the ... that's not\nWhat we're down there are some there are some of those definitely there are some\nBut this was just known as this is a Jewish community\nRight exactly and I've got several friends who still live in that community and show talking with them and getting updates from them this weekend is I'm from Pittsburgh and quite familiar with with this area so my heart breaks on a variety of different levels as well as many of you here's the very latest\nForty six year old Robert Ballard has never been on the radar of local law enforcement he's now charged with twenty nine federal crimes and it's scheduled to appear in

work there is an organization out there and I apologize with the acronym ... trio she they provide\nWorshipping he is to blame for those actions but this is not normal um and and I'm not necessarily saying the president is to blame but but words\nWords had meaning in speech can inspire violence it can\nAnd you have a moral responsibility in my opinion as president of the United states with the biggest bullhorn\nNot just in this country but in the world well to denounce doesn't believe and it it's it's it's very disheartening to me because I've struggled with this I've been a registered Republican my entire life up until this year\nAnd I expect more of the president than what we're currently getting I expect more prepared for disappointment like what we used to get from Ronald Reagan you want to hear how a president should handle hate how a president should handle violence\nAgainst other Americans well let me take you back to Ronald Reagan here's how should they handled folks\nA few isolated groups and the backwater of American lives still hold perverted notions of what America is all about [noise]\nRecently in some places in the nation [noise] there's been a disturbing re

out of step with our society you are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that is America\nAnd this country because of what it stands for will not stand for your comment that\nThat's what you're saying and asked this question I mean the president has built a political brand based on edgy rhetoric mhm so the flipside of that is sometimes people take it over the edge and while he's not the one with\nThe Trump saying that would be an admission that he said something wrong and in his world that's never happened\nSo he could never seen anything like that plus I don't believe you believe that that's what we need another leaving the point but maybe we need to stop looking\nLooking to Trump to save us from that I agree knowing he may not be the one with a gun in his hand he may not be the ones telling people to do it\nBut boy he's just pouring gasoline on that fire and then stands right and go I didn't know Gosling caught on fire\nSo is he directly responsible and is he doing you know and he's not going to why would you expect him to change all of a sudden it's arguable I get off the people that like well the president ... ... what in God's green earth is showing you
