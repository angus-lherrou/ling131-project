[noise]\nAnd a good morning to you a happy Wednesday there is a mother caravan large group of migrants headed to our southern border\nRide your bike burn for us sixty and makes you drive versus being home the march of the migraine or like you describe\nIs more like a caravan but the proud about Thirteen hundred migrants from on doors now more than doubled and they've crossed into ... on their way to the U.S border one mind written telling reporters were going to drop in on Donald Trump he has to take us\nThe president this morning's weeding not so fast says he's informed the leaders of Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow this to continue all payments made to their countries will stop [noise]\nYeah so I guess we have to go back in and and take a look at the kind of the geography of the area because this group\nOr it has been described I I I've seen a low of Thirteen hundred a high up three thousand if you will\nSo a sizable group of people are coming from Honduras north through Guatemala and then would continue into Mexico and the sensibly make it to our southern border Texas Arizona California unclear as to where\nWe've seen this before him oh yeah this is not the first the first ah rodeo caravan of migrants men women and children are are fleeing\nFor a variety reasons some purely economic uh the kitten support a family and their country some uh I I'm assuming\nBased on what we've learned the border are planning to make some sort of a clean for asylum that their lives are in danger in some way shape or form if they stay in the country I'm either way they're coming\nWell our our news department is on a fantastic job of really diving into the Guatemalans that has been released here from ice from after they've been going to the churches in town and we heard from an exclusive interview with I sat\nDown in Guatemala I see advertising you know that they've been on their TV news reports about hey go to the United states and you can see come Eric ... and so that's contributing to the rise of the amount of people coming to the border\nAnd when we were talking about this person said ... how long before Honduras and El Salvador get wind of this visit there exist when she gets around exploiting the loopholes in the American asylum\nPolicy because as somebody who seeks asylum versus the board across or\nI've always said is different than what we're seeing is or how did the same at least right now\nYeah and it's and it's not a hundred percent clear\nUm what what I can give him and his kind of the motivation and how are these groups I Know there's a a charitable organizations or\nUh what do you want to call migrants' rights groups that are helping coordinate this because to get this many people kind of moving as a unit yeah through multiple countries over what is it a thousand miles or more\nYeah and there were ... and there are certain things he didn't want to get into some of the specifics because\nUh you know he said well a lot of things I'm gonna have to refer to my lawyer Larry claiming because I haven't even seen the press release yet so he he didn't want to go into too many details it's kind of a an an overall on Iran right but it's going to have anything to you don't want to do anything to potentially damages case\nOkay but you're talking about liable which is false statements damaging to your reputation so what was in the New York times op ed that was for my boss and damaging to your reputation and he wasn't willing to answer any\nThere were a lot of the specific she wanted to go through his attorney so we'll we'll come running out of the voting out to the attorney but but basically false assertion he did feel like that that put you know after he said after fifty five years this could hurt my standing and and we saw and then there's court documents too but\nYou know could hurt a standing among Republican donors which makes you think wow maybe he still thinks he has a future in politics so well ask them okay does something up\nYou know you never say never in politics or some people said last this last election I came in late ... money and it was a tough road remember only one third of the people who voted\nOkay those those that boat didn't vote for you though you've finished third out of three [noise] um\nSo he is part of his lawsuit is that he thinks he still has a political career and that if he runs for office in the future these comments at the New York times made would damage a\nA a a run down the road for whatever political on it you know in whatever office\nRight and and you saw I think we saw was a pop potentially McCain seat and twenty twenty that that these we'd been rumored so you know there's that and and also something I thought was interesting as a hundred and forty seven and a half million\nAnd a lot of money that a lot of them I didn't go that number two one forty seven and a half million up to one forty eight that's exactly what I asked them\nI don't know that still lawyer that may be what they're worth papers words I don't know where it came up with a ...
