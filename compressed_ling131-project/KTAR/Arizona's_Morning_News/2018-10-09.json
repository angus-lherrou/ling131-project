[noise]\nGood morning and a happy Tuesday to you we're going to kick which show off with well the latest example of a broken immigration system [noise]\nRide your bike burn for us sixty and make sure Dr immigration\nCustoms Enforcement ice has started to release more than four hundred asylum seekers here in Arizona\nNo coalition of churches as well as some other organizations across our state have there'll be gun accepting immigrants that started this weekend close to one hundred immigrants dropped off Monday evening at shadow rock United Church of Christ [noise]\nYeah these issues um [noise] I Would say complicated but then again I think it's dirt simple once again what is happening where you have and this is primarily families are we know from our own Katie a our reporters at Rome's seem a lot of\nWomen with children or as an example and we've gone through ebbs and flows along our southern border it wasn't that long ago that they were separating family putting children in detention centers\nIn some cases hundreds of miles away from parents I'm going to use the term losing the kids a long way can't match them back up\nSo we had courts intervened and and a lot of the court's got him and said you can't do that they put restrictions on it\nAnd ice is basically saying we're playing by the rules that they gave us\nAnd that when we encounter people who are seeking asylum and present themselves that are crossing seasonal present themselves do border patrol agent the clock starts ticking and when the clock runs out we just put them on a bus and drop them off at for example a Phoenix\nChurch yeah but that hasn't always been the case um [noise] it has been under the Obama administration that you know when you present yourself to a border patrol agent or other border crossing and you're looking to seek asylum\nThat routinely rather quickly you're going to have a credible fear interview where you need to present a you know what's going on in your home country and while you're seeking asylum\nAnd if you don't present some sort of security risk here in the United states than you would be released in this like a man it's humanitarian parole I think is what they call it yeah and I never met her argument you got to make your argument but under the Trump Administration has taken quite some time for people\nTo make their argument and not only that but you've had different ice facilities\nThat have been locking up asylum seekers for quite some time I was reading a story earlier today Bruce of a woman who had been held in detention for ... ... months\nYou know and and again there's new rules rules denied by the courts in some cases they're not new but they're now actually ... their own policies are not enough that there's somebody looking over their shoulder might be a way to put it\nAnd I think this is the again stop me if you've heard this one before just another example of how broken the system is because\nWhat would I Wish was happening was a big knowledge of gravity that gravity exist\nAs that necessarily mean that the Democratic party does know that's why I'm not registered as a Democrat\n[laughter] either I'll tell you that much I think that's typical for some people as evidenced by the fact of the people I argue with every once in a while but not calling yourself a Republican doesn't mean you're a Democrat light rail remind you that in this state\nThe majority of voters are independent or not and are are not ... you guys are the fringes the people who self identified R. and B. pale and I as independents are the majority\nYeah and and I I think it is funny because that does become the default oh if you're not a Republican you must be a Democrat I promise you I I'm not I'm Sorry you\nCan't hold beef springs in your head but it in\nAnd and there are there are certain um there are certain ideology ideological beliefs of the Republican Party I still believe in smaller government less regulation there are parts of the\nDemocratic Party that I agree with you know I'm gay marriage and you know\nPro choice so yeah I'm In the middle on this um and and I have given up my my Republican cars where ...\nWhere are women going in and and and where where do women have an opportunity or or should I say who's who's appealing to them these days\n[noise] I I don't know I I honestly don't know who exactly they are appealing to a while I you know I can speak for myself that just because I'm not a Republican doesn't mean I'm a Democrat but that is where\nA lot of women are going on they're leaving the Republican Party in Nineteen Ninety four forty two percent of women other identified or leaned Republican in two thousand Seventeen only thirty seven percent of women identified or leaned Republican and it\nKeeps going down and people call the Trump effect is a is it fair to blame it all on Trump you know I\nI don't hold is present responsible for all of it I think that the Republican Party and the way that they handled themselves over the last decade or sell his what led to from being in power um I think part of the problem too is that there are some really great Republicans out there that\nI feel have just kind of shrank into the shadows and\nHaven't challenge this president the way that they should because he's afraid of ... exactly representing the party so I don't necessarily blame all of it on Trump but\nHe is an easy target he's an easy target because he has a tendency to insult women from Carly Fiorina to Megan Kelly to make a ... system and then you know dressed\nIn Mississippi at a rally this week he mocks Dr ... for the allegations um yeah he could be the lightning rod for it but if if the end all and be all of of women leaving the Republican Party ... now so\nSick of Republicans running in the state of Arizona are are are women looking at Republicans differently because of the things\nTrump says if you have it forcefully out and said that is fundamentally wrong I disagree with the president and I would never speak that way about a woman if you don't come out for ... is it basically you're endorsing\nNecessarily you don't come out forcefully I guess what I look when I look at candidates it's how much do you praise and on line\nWith if you're sitting there saying he's the best thing since sliced bread well we don't agree on a lot of things that we're going to find out how many will Republicans who haven't who've just trying to say this isn't happening will be suffer\nWill they suffer in the selection is women leave the Republican Party and women look at Republicans and
