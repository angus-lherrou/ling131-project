Everytime you send out another report and uh you know we've been reporting this morning that the Democrats are really kind of cut into the Republican leader in this early ballot stuff right\nOh I absolutely the uh the last couple of weeks as there are no quite exciting here um what about one point one million early votes this morning we expect to be well over one point to today after we received the process from America county\nUm and that will be more early ballots that we will have this year than we had in twenty fourteen so is this is it that makes it a record\nUh well it makes it a record for mail in ballot uh we presume that it's going to be a a Rob vote total record uh as far as a a turnout record 'em and it has a pretty high\nWe already have a pretty high bar casts sixty percent so um it's going to be around sixty percent or whether it's ... record breaking a I guess we'll tell a and yet as you said the last a week or so the Democrats have certainly uh early ballots have have entered I guess you would consider a search territory\nUm they had been a the gap between the parties had been kind of settled at ten eleven talking points and then uh last week or so and and consistently since then uh the the gap between the parties has been a plus six or seven Republican uh that that means that we are looking at certainly ending the U.S\nPlus six or seven Republican uh that that means that we are looking at certainly ending the election or with the gap in the single digits which is a very close for Arizona for for mid term\nFor majority we were talking with the secretary of state a senior analyst Gareth archer about the latest uh early ballot numbers but let's let's talk a little bit about election day so\nUh you know I I I've at various times in one of these people's like oh I get my ballots all filled out you know if my wife stays on me enough and then other times I find myself delivering the ballot\nTo ah you know the actual polling place uh what kind of numbers do we have in Arizona as far as people early ballots and showing up on election day\n[noise] so we're expecting a about a quarter of the electorate to show up on election day how those people will be polling place voters and half of them will be um people who are dropping off their early ballot at any polling place so that that's something to to remember you can drop off your early ballot at any polling place\nUh it doesn't have to be the one that you're assigned to 'em and uh usually that electorate is is very reflective of what the the the final electric for the early ballots are um sometimes they do favor the uh we've seen in the past is that sometimes they do favor\nA Republican balance by ever so slightly maybe one or two points at that point in the in the game there's so many ballots already baked into the cake that uh that that that the\nParty is split between the parties are for the election changed that much based on that final election day number you just love

was a major in the air force\nAnd saw the example that he said it really just felt this call to duty that I needed to step up and serve in this different way\nAnd so that's why I'm here and that's why I'm running for the Senate you know some people plan their whole lives you know they want to be in the Senate some day for me it was more of a\nCall to duty look myself in the mirror what can I Do to

thing we may not always agree on the issues\nThat doesn't matter but I Know that she will take a well informed approach to every issue and do what she thinks is right and that kind of authenticity and commitment to doing what is right\nThat kind of strong integrity is what we need\nBy the way I'm just completely distracted because all that and here's boomer I Know that having reading in the background so we're talking with Martha ... and you don't want figuring out who voted for what when it comes to pre existing conditions very confusing for voters if you've been watching the commercials are just really hard\nFor me just let me ask you this if if\nLosing preexisting conditions protections means a repeal of Obamacare are you willing to sacrifice little smart\nLook we need to protect people with preexisting conditions and I am committed to making sure that insurance companies are forced to cover people with preexisting conditions and I voted for that\nWe cannot go back to the past we all know someone there's someone very close to me I don't want to you know for their privacy talk about it for who went bankrupt because he was diabetic and he couldn't get access to health insurance before Obamacare\nThe Obamacare intentions were good to help cover people who are falling through the cracks but the model of how they did it was poor and it has failed\nIt's a federal government tops down one size fits all a trillion dollars a tax is\nSeven hundred billion Rob from Medicare and the individual health insurance market it's failed under Obamacare is those people who don't get their insurance from their employer Medicare Medicaid or VA\nUh it's about seven percent of people and this is a really really important to remember is that if people either entrepreneurs small business owners early retirees people going back to school people would be between jobs\nThose are the ones that right now under Obamacare are falling through the cracks because many of them are uncovered as we speak so having legislation that says we existing conditions are covered doesn't mean it actually happens\nAnd so we have to fix it and moving forward it's a complicated issue health care but just know that I roll up my sleeves like I Do with everything and I'm going to protect people as we work towards better solutions that provide more options at a lower

called music licensing in the United states and this is how artists make money off of their songs being played on a radio station being played at a nightclub a at a restaurant if you are a cover band and you are a play music ... so\nSo there are royalties you've heard about that right that artist make their money from so they have there is a company that they license or music or they're they're actually two big ones\nAnd let's say you are I don't even know where the Trump event was but it's a it's a public call what say or a\nA concert venue or a a convention center that place that venue
