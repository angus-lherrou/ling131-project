answers a GPA or has an exclusive interview with Phoenix field office director\nFor ice trying to get some answers as to what's going on [noise]\nJoining us in Studio right now she is the key to our news director Marc Mauer and she's also the one that just recently conducted this interview a sat down with the Phoenix field office director for the U.S immigration and Customs Enforcement record\nIce you sit down with Henry Louis Cheryl this week and tried to get some answers because I think for a lot of people wouldn't we hear the stories we hear bits and pieces of it and I'll be the first one the knowledge I don't understand how it all goes together it still sounds like a bit of a haphazard\nProgram or system can we start from the beginning yeah it's complicated immigration is complicated bank yeah who knew who was this complicated by the way who anyway let's start with who are the people the majority of people showing up at the border today\nRight so and the change the face of the immigrant that's coming up to the Arizona border has changed dramatically\nAnd he used to be you know from Mexico City perhaps just males young men yeah Russian workers workers now we're hearing that it's family\nUnit so it's either a parent or parents with a a minor under the age of Eighteen or a guardian with a minor and they're coming to the border mainly from Central America and one country stands out country of Guatemala eighty five percent of the\nPeople that show up at the border from Guatemala according to ... the director of ice now I've heard\nOur exclusive reporting on this all morning and there was a part of it Martha that really jumped out to me\nBecause I've gone to great lengths on his very show to make the distinction between any illegal border crossers and somebody who is seeking asylum in this country one is crossing the border illegally one is a seeping persecution in their own country\nSo when I heard your interview with the ice director and he said this changed a lot\nFor me take a listen folks on the news in Guatemala they're saying that you can get a work permit if your family if you're coming with your child and that you're going to be released their advertising\nThis in a way yes and and you know we don't have those ads\nAre those TV commercials are news reports or what not but what the director tells me is it's it's what has gotten to Guatemala to where it's easy to come\nWell actually the hard part is getting here right but they're telling them what am I on and not only the news reports it saying hey what's happening in the U.S is that people show up at the border and their process but at the end of the day they're released which is what we've seen in the last few days but what he also tells me is smugglers are also telling people it's\nThe country is never going to go we are going tore anymore and on and made it as a country all what it is and so to be on the forefront of that is fantastic and I applaud the governor and I love the jobs I Love the research and if we can become as you put at the uh the Detroit of self driving cars\nIn the country I think that would be amazing but I also want a little bit of an oversight on this\nBecause let's not forget there was a situation in Tempe where you had an ... or self driving car that struck and killed up a dollar in you know after we dove into that we know that the driver was watching the voice on streaming service when is it all happened\nOver shut down there you know their self driving here in Arizona Arizona and at the time we email which you see all over the valley particularly the east valley view if you're kind of in the crosshairs as well\nBut when we don't have regulation we don't have information and in California where they they require certain points of data to be given to people over ... we learned that way mo can go on I was trying to find the numbers here and I can't seem to do it but it was something like they go\nLike a hundred thousand miles before the driver has to intervene\nIt was the ... the self driving car is autonomous for much longer than the ... driving car ... the super technology required human interaction a heck of a lot more than the way most self driving technology both using different systems so it\nThe over though are regulators found out that it went just twelve hundred miles below the cruise went twelve hundred miles per intervention in bars was down to like Penn so you see and I grabbed the where yeah\nThere's a discrepancy there and so I think that this is fantastic and I love the technology and everything but I also want some oversight on it\nYeah and and maybe ... is weird that balances I mean if you want to be\nAnd you want to incentivize these companies to come here they're not going to pick a place where they've got state regulators looking over their shoulder all the time I get it I don't know if you can have both now and I also want to say this and I think it's all great the governor do see\nA an intel announced this um they're they're talking about committing a couple of million dollars to this\nMust be out in the Senate chump change that'll paint the outside of the building and do the landscaping around it okay if this was this is not a commitment um of significant let them know you may be the start and it may build into something more argument knowledge and great you know I thought but will it\nLet's be clear though it's the commerce authority that's committing one and a half million a million more is going to be coming from the Transportation Department and then you mentioned intel it's got its own undisclosed roast financial contribution so there there's going to be more than a million dollars that are going to go towards that one is\nThe state of Arizona didn't say were committing billions to this not worth the better not right they better not all but think about it if if you know private industry let's get another one you know and I ... I'd have to go back you know how to Detroit become the\nAuto capital of the United states\nAnd somewhere is going to become a self driving capital of the United states is it going to be Phoenix is it going to be Arizona and what does that mean jobs industries that are around it I like that we're looking forward ... nothing bad about that I'm Glad that we're not trying to become the world leader in building coal fired plants you know I'm I'm Glad we're least looking ahead\nHere since ... she has there's a lot of video of her out there saying things some of them are decidedly crazy and she's got another series of comments out there you can make an argument disparaging the state of Arizona but will it hurt her we'll talk about her audio coming up next\nBreaking news and your favorite Katie a our news personality [noise]\nWith a K T.
