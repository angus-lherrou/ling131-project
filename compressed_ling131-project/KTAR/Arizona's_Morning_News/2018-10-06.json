are you guys are churning that renewable generation right now is we are you all do it a good job here this morning\nIn a crank up a little more today and we'll see if we can get Jeremy how y'all are generating this renewable energy\nSo a lot of it is so we're\nJust some grid scale solar some residential solar some commercial solar uh we do have a community solar and there's also um what right now there's nine ... megawatts of wind and we've got a little bit of a little bit of hydro and you're not a hundred percent sure okay\nY'all y'all have the the ... on the conventional um\nFossil fuel

it generates puts into the grid we supply power to a a lot of Tucson and then we sell some to nab Apache huh\nActually I I think wherever there's\nA need and we can sell some energy\nWill do it so you're buying this energy and separate curious thing about electricity because there's nothing to do with the un use electricity you have it has to be generating a consume the same time does it ... it's instantaneous you constantly reading and anticipating by nanoseconds how many how much consumption is going to come on line\nFor you to kind of like throw it all up yet and throughout all day we were talking about on peak and off the and how responsible it is for Arizona homeowners to start buying off the move your consumption off peak I agree it's a good move and your help folks do that by some of the propositions\nNot on a wealth of propositions a bad word to use your election but some of the ... campaign campaigns a bad word to use as little as has some programs some of the programs that job offer to help people get a little bit more efficient in their purchasing\nYeah yeah um they change all the time so I'd recommend calling up to see is ours and asking um what they have um they may send you to a professional check out the website it's got\nStuff therefore duck blaster testing duck ceiling a air conditioning\nCheckups a\nThermostats you know all the things you can use to to

remodeling\nJust leakage yeah one hundred percent of the homes have duct week it's\nIt's the amount we try\nOver fifty percent of the homes have more than twenty five percent that we could so y'all have a program that will help homeowners seal those up\nYeah yeah it's a oh gridlock hair yeah but yeah there's a there's a broken their a call up and um or actually go on line and there are participating vendors or a a Tracy companies that come out and do that they have and as long as it's participating\nContractor um they can fill your ducks and um get some type of rebate\nNow folks to fifty percent of the homes have more than twenty five percent linkage I'm telling you that means twenty five percent of your air conditioning bill in the middle of the summer is going to air condition

W per square foot just ... speaking that's a good ball park okay really devote Fifteen hundred square foot home is going to consume Fifteen hundred\nK. WBAI yeah and maybe more in the summertime yeah let less in the spring and fall and then in the winter depends on what your heating sources okay so in that perspective\nOn the renewable energy we do have GDP is plugged into some wind generators yeah are they in state yeah there are all what's it called me gets red hearts passage just outside of Wilcox okay and it's interesting right because solar you get it during the day\nAnd the way the wind blows their um from what the operator and telling me is in the morning\nAnd in the evening on the shoulders the wind tends to blow more there and I think yesterday I saw that we got a written fifty one megawatt what is this dial on your house right there so that's the total is that ... yeah you're producing two hundred meds right now yeah right now okay so that's the solar and the\nWhen the our entire reasonable ... who the portfolio excuse me\nThat she's almost she's she's begging right up on that two hundred and mark right now yeah\nGood job they were running around to twenty yesterday it okay um we've got more coming online or the guys that work in a new group are doing a fantastic job of getting things out there uh within the rape case that we had going through a\nSolar insulation applications are have gone through the rough so we're we're busy\nThe good thing well I really appreciate you coming in because we do talk a lot about the a PS rate um\nThe bases for sheer numbers and the number of customers that they have you know as a majority of our listeners but then they got probably a lot more attention and press coverage and they were hoping for in the elections of four and six years ago\nFor six years ago and the corporation commission hearing that ... you know they they they they raise the rate plan issue to the very for for yeah\nThat they did but y'all are doing basically the same thing they're doing I mean we're every utility company is trying to push the consumer into responsible amount of staggering their consumption ... exactly and\nSome of the ... the program we talked about earlier are there to actually help you use less electricity and maybe to push it off on the shoulders or even
