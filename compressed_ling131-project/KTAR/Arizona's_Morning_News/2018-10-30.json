Arizona's news station J. G. A. R. news [noise]\nYou might get some perspective now with Bruce they've Jay and family you\nHad a good morning to you happy Tuesday we jump right into the show with a discussion of\nThe fourteenth amendment so lead\nRiding your bike burn ward off a U.S sixty and makes you a drive\nWith ever sort of the show talking about them as well but a person familiar with the internal White House debate says the topic of birthright citizenship which was part of the fourteenth amendment\nHas come up various times over at least the last year\nNow president Donald Trump tells Axios on HBO he wants to end birthright citizenship for babies born to non citizen and immigrants not authorized to be in the U.S now most scholars believe ending birthright citizenship would require a constitutional amendment\nYeah maybe we have to start with ... ... did you want to start with the with the comments or do you want to start with an explanation of the fourteenth um and I think we need to start with let's the fourteenth amendment because most people probably can recite it to\nThe Fourth Amendment to the U.S constitution says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the hero section there of our citizens of the United states and other states or in ...\nSo the fourteenth amendment is a ... and the clause that you just heard responded there is the citizenship clause that guarantees the right of US citizenship for all children born in the United states the\nFourteenth amendment was a\nReaction to a ... a spin off of it goes back to the Eighteen sixties six\nUh is the period of reconstruction after the civil war because those you'd remember some of your history slaves in the United states were not American citizens there for their children were not American citizens and this was a attempt to write about\nWrong is that is that a fair it's a fair it's a it's a very broad level but I think let's stick there right now wears you started yeah you can get really in the weeds on this so why are we talking about the fourteenth amendment and why are we getting a history lesson on it well the president has said he wants to get rid of it\nBut the president is talking about doing it hasn't done it yet is to do away with birthright citizenship that the idea that if you were born in the United states you are a citizen of the United states\nSo last night at a surprise the reporter for Axios on HBO had gotten a bit of a leap from what I understand I've been following this story this morning and he had gotten a lead that when he had the opportunity to sit down with the president he asked the question ... and here's how that went\nMorning and he had gotten a lead that when he had the opportunity to sit down with the president he asked the question and here's how that went\nSome legal scholars believe you get rid of the crisis and ship without changing the way and executive order exactly uh have you thought about that is totally off it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional a member 'cause\nYeah right um so the reality is he actually had a good out\nUm but his is going to go ahead and go anyway I'm even though he's not welcome there but also I Will be willing to acknowledge that if you were a local or state official if Europe Pittsburgh or a ... a Pennsylvania state officials are already your option is\nDo you stand on the tarmac and greet Trump or walk with him to a hospital or do you attend the funeral\nYou see what I'm saying like like those those elected officials those whatever you want to call leaders are going to say I'm going to the funeral\nWell that is what the mayor of Pittsburgh is saying he said at the president is looking to come to our city I Would ask that he not do so well we are burying the dead our attention and our focus is going to be on them and we don't have public safety that we can take away from what is needed in order to do both I\nThink of the fear they have of of more of these wounds targeting the the funerals of these people\nSo if you have that where yeah it it it's that you know you're you're putting politicians in a difficult position but are you putting the president and the difficult position as well like you can't win in reality but I I think he can't win because of\nHis own words and actions yeah I mean if he ... himself in this position\nIf he doesn't do Bruce it's back if he does go Bruce it's bad I mean the the president is in a lose lose situation and he's not going to make everyone happy and I frankly I don't think he wants their care can everyone happy now I think that there could be\nA more calculated way of doing this may be waiting until the weekend to go letting it settled a little bit\nYour goal is not to comfort ensued he's\nLooking at an election on Tuesday as evidenced by all this other stuff the house rallies he wants to attend these got more uh uh you know horrific things he needs to say between now and Tuesday in an effort to further so divisiveness so it really going to Pittsburgh is a is a hindrance to get them this way\nSo we've got the the president who's facing a lot of opposition in fact some thirty thousand people have signed an open letter saying that he's not welcome in Pittsburgh until he announces that white nationalism in stops targeting\nMinorities here's a little bit from the former president of the synagogue that had the shooting over the weekend and here's what she had to say about the president coming to Pittsburgh take a listen\nYou welcome the president of Pittsburgh in the wake of the [noise]\nAre you

people who stand by as who believe in value not just Jewish value of of all even values and those are not the values of this president and I do not welcome him to Pittsburgh\nTo keep in mind again the comment Trump promised me today\nMake it harder for him to go to Pittsburgh when he starts talking about immigrants but the reason the shooter went into the churches because he believed that
