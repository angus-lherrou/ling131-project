things to do out there in a beautiful uh October we've had the best I can recall and that this is about the ideal perfect growing whether you know we're days in the you know the seventies the nineties

seven\nCindy in Mesa good morning Cindy\nHill morning Hi Hi\nThanks for taking my call\nJust two quick questions I have or like it's in my backyard they'd been there Twenty years\nAnd ah one is I Wonder what is the best time to call in Arbor it to trim those trees and then the other is in the summer months I just seem to lose her to leave it gets pretty thin\nAnd I don't know what changed but you know what I can do about\nThat well here's what I Would just send you hide it from them would really be after our typical ... would you be the first of march be a great time to get in improving your ... and you can reduce or size and that's gonna make them healthier and happier you know if I could sit really pretty drought tolerant\nBut in the summertime they should be water and heavy about once a week or so and that you can water once every two weeks if you really get a good deep irrigation but about once a week on bigger fight this would be kind of ideal\nAnd if you want to keep some of the drop down a there's a couple of different things that may be causing drop number one is like if you're ever green and they just drop all the time and for them to drop as they're growing is pretty normal and if you reduce the size of the tree with with the printing in the spring it won't drop as much\nType and for them to drop as they're growing is pretty normal and if you reduce the size of the tree with with the printing in the spring it won't drop as much and the other thing is we have had some problems with some uh different white flies and things in the trees that have really kind of\nMade the trees then more so you want to make sure that they're healthy and if you see the white flies you'd probably want to treat for them as well\nOkay so I guess it can't over water I guess maybe that's what I'm doing\nWell you it's pretty hard to over water if I can spike or very forgiving trees they can take a tremendous amount of water but they can survive when they're mature on on you know very infrequent water there were some overt sky harbor airport that sat there with no water for about three years and I was\nJust amazed I mean so they can they can ... you know be pretty drought tolerant I wouldn't recommend that to any one as far as a way\nTo grow wind but realistically weekly watering in the summer it would be ideal for mature trees\nOkay well thank you thank you said you have a nice weekend you might say\nOh let's see next definitely got Stephanie in Scottsdale but after ... we have open lines number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven good

delivered in with the ... bag that actually got an ...\nAn egg plant and maybe two years ago mayor and a half it to a certain height and then it just stopped growing and I've experienced it before it green I can keep it rained and fertilize it and water and everything I'm supposed to do\nAnd then it grows little or attempt to grow a little and they leave and they just kind of don't they they pulled up and they don't know for them and as I said I have a different type of trade that I had planted in my front yard did a couple of years ago and it was written down we discover\nIsn't it live a few years and died\nWithin a ... you know it was not\nOK so really that tree that you bought from\nYou know that that's a good friend of mine John ... Greenfield citrus nursery in yeah great guy\nHead I don't mind giving them a plug he's a he's a good guy we're we're friends and do business together back and forth and lie about it from him well he's against it so anyway ah Algerian tangerines a slower growing citrus than most it's an old variety here that has seeds one of my favorites is you know sweet\nOr your properly experiencing some pretty heavy thrift damage\nAnd the little trips and insect that gets on it in the summertime and scars new growth when it comes out\nBut uh the number one thing I Would have your check is to make sure you're not keeping it too wet especially in the wintertime so in the wintertime it should be watered about once every two weeks in the summertime probably weekly or you should fertilizes if you want to grow out of that and grow fast fertilize it once a month starting in February through September\nMake sure that the trunk is wrapped normally Jon hasn't wrapped in burlap when they planted them\nAnd uh that burlap we should be left on so that protects the son from the trunk and if it's not growing out in the spring when they start to grow again in March or April you might want to go ahead and spray the trip on it but normally hear in the valley we have enough lay swings to control or three up in the tree will usually grow out of it\n[noise] okay I have a I'm a I don't\nThink trip damage I say that talking like from somebody who knows nothing big band here's why I planted another a tree\nProbably Fifteen feet away from it and uh that tree I bought at Costco and I bought it oh maybe last year and it's not experiencing anything like that at all but my question would be what I Do not have this trip\nWith no river really tiny you can see this rep I can actually see thrift with my glasses on a bright sunny day with a piece of newspaper white paper you beat the and the you know the the\nTree on the on the paper and and you'll see the script but here's the difference between the tree variety\nProbably bought a Costco and the tree you bought from John ... if you bought that or a Tangerine Tree from John ... it's going to be on a sour orange rich stock and it's going to produce delicious fruit\nBut um you know you could actually send some photographs in on that uh the leaves and we might have a pretty good shot at guessing what it is if you happen to have a fruit still we could probably tell for sure but\nThe reality is the you know from it's probably easier just to start planning a nutri but if you want to play with it and grow it you know we had a tree at the nursery window avenue when I was younger my grandfather had actually grafted twenty two varieties on the same tree so that's all real doable and if you want to play with it you know it's kind of fun to do\nI was younger my grandfather had actually grafted twenty two varieties on the same tree so that's all real doable and if you want to play with it you know it's kind of fun to do\nOkay well thank you very much thank you Joe ... of that I buy well is this\nWas the moral power lines folks number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven Richard and Phoenix good morning\nHi Brian thanks for during the show it's it's it's really productive illicit is in the morning um I had a crush on elementary one but on manure put it I've got about an acre lot it's mostly grass but around the outside you know there's a lot of dirt and I've got planting trees and all that going on um is there a difference between\nThe power of like the newer versus non said it\nWas when ... especially if you're married or if you have neighbors and you know it makes a big difference but um you know it depends on how the new Moore's actually composting what's been done to it\nYou know with with chicken manure for example if you pour right away from the chicken coop and you're bringing out the ammonia that comes off it you know is actually as a ... and really smells terrible gives off a tremendous amount of nitrogen\nSo that ammonia I'm basically we had one time a big pile from ... down in our farm or was it was kind of tour advantages we asked take months if we could get some raw manure and they had a rainy time and most of the newer from their firemen Stanfield goes to the Indian reservation down there to the auctions and Steven those guys use if we were able to get it\nAnd they produce a hundred times a day\nAnd these big piles of manure set out there and we didn't get around to spreading it when it came fresh out of the groups and it was like wet concrete\nBut the prevailing winds turned our palm tree farm iridescent green just what's the ammonia that came off in the nitrogen volatile nation that we got the benefits so that can be a huge benefit\nAnd asthma newer as Tom posted in more of a lot of that ... nitrogen does a skate but for the most part you know the newer is going to be used as we could use cow manure it not so much for the nitrogen just to add organic material to the soil it usually is not very high and nitrogen if it's one to two percent that's pretty good for ... or\nSo and it depends where it comes from if it comes out of a feedlot or a dairy and how much you earn spin on it a those things I'll make a difference to Richard\nOkay I appreciate the casket it's too real quick insure or um or betting about over the last five years about to survive in our front porch covered\nUm they get they get some a little bit of sunlight but it's already trick to I mean we we've tried to water at all and I mean there's some ... says that works and others but thirty anything to do to get consistency of how much should water because we're killing them\nWell Richard this for a lot of different varieties you know we and the cactus you come to the nursery and come look at we have you know native species here from our desert with our climate and then a lot of cactus tropical that come from Central America\nAnd uh so it was a cactus and that whole group of plants you might have a plant that came from Africa and when it pretty wet area or Central America or you know you have something that's more native like ours um it's really kind of important to know what type of soil their planted that\nYou know you can plan a cactus in the heavier soil mix with you know having some natural soil in there and your water that cactus maybe once every two or three weeks in the summertime [noise]\nA lot of cactus are grown in very light commercial cactus next which is going to drain very quickly and you can water those in a nursery we know we might be water and those cactus in the middle of summer especially some of the four seasons things daily\nSo it's going to depend on the variety and it's going to have him on the soil type that is growing in\nYou know what I Would really suggest is whenever you select a cactus in the nursery just asked you know and and take a look for yourself see what type of a soil mix it's being grown in\nAnd and kind of find out what the cultivars are you know some common things like golden barrels come from Baja California so they are really pretty drought tolerant but what they normally would get there is more humidity than we would have\nYou know they get that coastal kind of influence over there but I'm so there's quite a difference but you know in some cactus do well in full sun others you know do well in the shade most of them will grow outdoors with pretty good light but your water is going to depend more on the type of soil that you plant them and then another factor\nPursuit that paid any attention to that so we'll do that All right thank you Brian and then my turtle and just as we always get our tree our Christmas tree up at your Glendale shop power the price as a Christmas tree so sure\nWell Christmas trees are kind of short on the market I'd been working with our growers you know we've we've got two main growers to grow Christmas trees that we've dealt with for the past twenty five years and they're really\nNice family farms and then we've got this ... kind of a crazy fund eclectic guy that he harvests trees\nOff real high elevation in northern California and now we have some trees that come from Wisconsin with some of our Frazier's but I'm a Christmas tree prices are probably going to to go up a little bit because this kind of a short\nYeah we have some trees that come from Wisconsin with some of our Frazier's but I'm\nA Christmas tree prices are probably going to to go up a little bit because it's kind of a shortage on Christmas trees and you hear that every year but this year it's somewhat true I mean there's a lot less treats available the normal\nYou know we're going to have a decent supply because we've always been good to our farmers and they've been good to us and returned and I wouldn't think there's going to be a lot of difference in price from last year in our prices have been pretty similar for the last Fifteen Years\nAnd not really changed that much but that was really tricky about Christmas trees this year makes especially difficult as having that early Thanksgiving\nAnd you know for me personally I just really don't enjoy having that early Thanksgiving and having customers don't want to put up a tree you know a month before Christmas and are there are trees that will do that and if you're going to put up a tree that early\nI Would recommend one way in Bambi silver kept it comes from high elevation or one of the trees coming from Wisconsin which will be a phrase your first and the reason why is because in cold climate the needles are more set\nAnd the trees are actively growing the majority of our Christmas trees come from Washington and Oregon with the majority actually coming from Washington and it's a you know somewhat rain forest types climbing up there where it's really not that cold\nAnd often times we don't have real hard freezes you know before the end of November and uh so I really would encourage people to put trees up you know somewhere from the seventh of December on and not to be too early with this a real early season you know Christmas trees or something that we've done now for well over Thirty years\nAnd they've been a lot of fun and they can bring a lot of joy but we want you to have the best product possible so there's varieties that we won't be cutting a like ran for his in Douglas first we won't even have those trees in the nurseries before the seventh of December because they won't last it they're harvested too early\nOrphaned by trees from the one deal struck Christmas trees for the last Twenty years and we've always had trees are always deliver guys are killed her great down there so I'm gonna I'm gonna give them a pop quiz on the wane Bambi trees\nWell they they'll they'll others silver and they want to know about way and but when it's a fun funny person\nHow do you defer to the streets down there do they\nWell Hitler silver tips what they are the words of article more layered tree and when when you're choosing a Christmas tree if you get the one that has the least needles on it the more open trees because they're not trying to pull as much water through the cameo player the bark they're going to last much longer and you're home\nAll right Brian thanks for your time they can Richard happened I can apply to\nA

six so to to seven seven\nFive eight to seven we could talk about that you want to grow water plant fertilizer kill and our first caller this hour Mr Joe and Apache junction good morning\nBoy do I got a question for a while to get a a movie that great food what's the best food stocks gathered onto it surely could\nWell you know we're going to plant some commercial ruby red grapefruit or at our farm and grapefruit or one that will grow on on lemons too you know so typically oftentimes have grapefruit where they're grown a macro fill our vocal Marianna grapefruit in effect grapefruit in itself can be a pretty good route stock\nBut uh what my friend Bryan over with young citrus and Brian just a little older than me but uh Mr young I was really kind of recommended using\nThis curries as what they're using right now for the ruby red grapefruit but there's a lot of different styles but the nice part about a ruby red grapefruit is it'll probably produce pretty good quality fruit on just about any roots stock\nAnd um so I Would look more at the tree than they would reach stuck on ruby red grapefruit now that's different from oral ... if you were one of grapefruit you have to have on a curries or orange type rich stock but the ruby red I think you could honestly grow Joe on on pretty much any type of leverage doc\nOkay what what is yours\nWell the ones I just order which we're going to plant in twenty twenty because it's how long they have to have these trees growing we used to grow um ourself when I was young we grew in mind sour orange the trees I just ordered are going to be on ...\nAnd um the trees that you might find a veil a book could be on any one of those it could be on a C thirty five or ... you probably won't find one on sour orange um but um you know I don't I don't think it makes so much difference Jo with ruby red grapefruit Hi thank you thank you Bye bye okay\nWell that was wide open phones folks give us a call number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven we could talk about anything you want to grow water plant fertilizer kill you know we're hearing this great gardening season really kind of the best time of the whole year to get out and plant and\nAnd also a good time to do a little yard clean up out there and if you want to grow beautiful and you'll you know there's nothing prettier than the geraniums that we can grow here this time of year but the petunias now it's cool enough for pansies to snap the stocks you know you can have a beautiful flower garden it just smells fantastic\nAnd is really bright whether you want to do it in pots or or you wouldn't do it in the ground either way if you want to grow winter food you know it's really easy here to grow lettuce broccoli cabbage cauliflower kale\nAnd he could plant onion sets this time of year you could plant uh radishes if you want to you can plant carrots if you want your he little garlic those ... plants and then the greens are this is the time of year it's not really the time of year for fruiting plant so if you have to do is you could try and keep them to the winner of the last two years we haven't had any for us so\nI wouldn't give up on tomatoes you have now\nAnd if you want to start peppers for spring and if you want to have a big job\nThe last two years we haven't had any for us so I wouldn't give up on tomatoes you have now\nAnd if you want to start peppers for spring and if you want to have a big jump on your peppers and grow your own from seeds or you'd probably want to plant those pepper seeds somewhere about the end of November to get a plant big enough to plan out in the garden by the last ... which is typically the fifteenth of February\nWell give us a call you guys y'all can lead the conversation whatever you want to talk about we can talk about there's lots of things to grow here we have our beautiful native plants we have the iron was the ... and the misdeeds combined with our ... and the little hedgehog a lot of beautiful plants\nBut\nNever\nDid they\nWelcome back to the garden youthful Sunday Morning and uh we do have three lines open the number to call six so to to seven seven\nFive eight to seven Joe in Scottsdale good morning Joe\nGood morning hey I've got two questions or questions on to treat the first one is at Texas olive\nAnd uh I I found out that yesterday why they call it a Texas all of the ... the librarian at one over there we had dropped ... everywhere I went in the summer and it's doing beautifully and I really like it um is there any way I can spray to prohibit the olive oil from coming in or can I\nJust knock off the little I noticed my starting to bud these little budge a little clusters can I just knocked those off and all that harm the tree if I did that I mean as it doesn't need to set fruit\nYou know it really doesn't need to set fruit Joe and that you could probably prudent in this time of year improving the ... before they fall or is it bidding process you could try some floor our possibly try a little bit of vinegar on those flowers so that they wouldn't set\nHope there's such a beautiful it's really just you know kind of tolerate and but you know really that's one of my favorite little smaller trees oh I Love evergreen beautiful white flowers all summer and with flowers on those a comfort [laughter]\nOkay well okay well anyway I I can live with I just didn't I seen it at the library for years but never this time of year I guess and I didn't know I see what they call it detects if it makes quite a few holiday\nMeal they probably had the printing crew there you know clean up before I met my second\nQuestion is I have a chased tree or um and it puts out the beautiful a purple little flowers but that was like clusters of grapes almost [noise] hello\nYes okay I'm Sorry anyway went after they go from purple to that the brown color should I Do anything to them or they fall off or\nWith a little seeds get all fall off and they usually don't germinate too much round your yard but you know that's kind of the nature of that tree it's well it's a beautiful three all summer\nIn or you know what I kinda like to do with him at the nurseries to prove them and send them in the wintertime kind of almost like a crate Myrtle you can kind of back on the outside especially if you want to limit the size of the tree cut a lot of that old forwards meals all blooms off\nAll day and be ready for the next year the spring you know a great time to prove that tree would probably be right around the holidays at the end of the year\nOkay wonderful thank you very much for mission thank you have a nice weekend job too Bye bye bye [noise] oh the next step we've got Jose in Phoenix but after Jose folks we've got some open lines number to call six\nSo to to seven seven five eight to seven good morning Jose good morning high\nA would learn about the fertilizing queen palm trees\nYou know Jose queen palms really do like quite a lot of fertilizer but it's getting kinda late in the season for it to be a much benefit this time of year um I Would really recommend you know starting with the fertilizer pretty happy about the fifteenth of February and then probably again April and probably again the end of may\nOkay yeah it does any any kind of fertilizer\nWell what do you need a couple of different things one is there like a lot of manganese and like more manganese\nOkay yeah it does any any effort then\nA well what they needed a couple of different things one is there like a lot of ... and he said like more manganese and we ... we have in our soil we have enough manganese from most plants but they like more so I Would put manganese spikes in there and a little spice you can buy now you could put the mania these spikes in right now but that you're thinking about it\nAnd they're going to last in the soil among leach through so if you want to put the manganese spikes in right now it'd be fine the other thing the alike as magnesium which is the same as apps and salt\nAnd uh you know if they're pretty good sized treat you could put a couple of cups for ... per tree and that's not going to burn it's going to be beneficial to them as well and then in the growing season what they're going to once again what more nitrogen so the time when they're gonna need that\nNitrogen as from really march you know through the summer and um so if you want to fertilize them you know in the spring with those with this kind of a basic palm tree fertilizer even citrus food if you're adding extra manganese magnesium ... do well\nVery much thank you have a nice weekend it's just [noise]\nWell that leaves us with wide open phones folks I guess we can talk about some other kind of fun things to get out and doing the garden this time of year or you can call we can talk about anything and it is you might want to grow\nCertainly a lot of styles here you know we're in this you know semi tropical desert climate were two years on without a frost there's papaya is hanging over fences with big fruit never seen before in my life and it could be that this winter the storms come from the north\nAnd melt the papaya plants but that that would be more the norm but you never know and are certainly a lot of fun things to try and different things to do here\nAnd uh you know those things like mangoes what you're doing quite well because we haven't had the freezes\nAnd when we don't have freezes or if you're willing to protect you know we can grow a lot more of these tropical types of plants and he was a beautiful bananas here I mean you can grow the vanilla banana or car Monnett bananas are kind of pretty and do our fruit usually not very large the trees can be really pretty sad if you want that tropical look those kinds of things work well\nAnd like we've talked a little earlier we have our own beautiful native desert plants and then we also\nHave some of those that we kind of an improved gone over the years and not that we really did it by their nature did but we have a ... it's called an American mosquito\nAnd what it is a hybrid and it's a combination of our own Arizona native ... a Texas hunting Muskie a Chilean mosquito Argentinean ... an American Missy from all different parts of the Americas and what's nice about this tree is it doesn't break in the wind\nAnd that it's very sturdy rooted and it also doesn't have store and so it's a it's a nice ... if you want them to ski it's also washer and more evergreen many Muskie Fridays are much like a Chilean as much stronger than a Chilean Muskie\nSo whatever your dream whatever your desire or whatever you want to plant give us a call the number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven\nWe have price you're on the phone and the music that we could talk about whatever it is you want to grow and certainly lots of styles and this is the best planting season you know of the whole year if you were to pick a month here that desert when you can plant\nAnd get a garden going plant a shade tree still plant desert trees grow beautiful color it's right now in other places they have hard winters and they can't grow color you know except for the short seasons summer here we can grow beautiful flowers whether in containers are in the ground planted this time of year\nWe have all of her front tropical plants that we can mix in them you know when you travel around the world a lot you'll see ... v is growing almost everywhere from southern Europe to the tropics\nAnd a bit truthfully I think some of the prettiest ... v as anywhere on the planet\nGrow right here in our deserts with our lower humidity and are changes in temperatures you know this is the time of year when our brass on our broken V. as can get absolutely beautiful and as such this is probably not the time you want to prove them a over the next month or so those ... are going to term bright red or\nPurple or goal whatever variety have but this is probably the time not to be ... printing are tropical take advantage of the beautiful flowers and they have\nAnd really enjoy them in our garden because he really can make a huge difference and\nYou know ... are kind of always a love hate thing I mean they are a little messier with the blooms flowing around but uh there's not many plants that love the heat in this environment any better than above them via\nRan Tempe good

Davis nursery\nI Know it was Mr ... bands nursery his name was\n... yeah ... you know is to ah\nFind these a coral trees and sell them at his place or a chart stole but is it possible to get in the world trade is uh I Know there are mental for for uh the winter months but\nHave what what do we usually we usually carry a coral trees I'm In the spring so if you if you're in St Peter's come by our nursery there in South Phoenix the one in Gilbert and we'll have ... we probably\nA coral trees I'm In the spring so if you over here in Tempe just come by our nursery there in South Phoenix is the one in Gilbert and we'll have groceries we'd probably have some in stock right now there is as you mentioned that you know they can't be frost tender\nBut yeah the time that we'll be bringing more in it is you know going into the spring and they bloom beautifully in the summer there's lots of different varieties of poetry summer like a large Bush um can make a large degree and Joe depending on where you're located in Tempe or they can do pretty well\nWell I played a baby this one so I don't know if you you put it in a big ... keep it in a big uh a little while for the weather or a just a planet the cover it up but it gets cold\nRate where are you located in tip you well cross streets\nOf well I'm In I'm In the lakes because ... basically\nYeah so that's not a really cold area and you know our our weather tends to be trending warmer so I wouldn't be afraid to plan a quarrel tree out in your yard there in the spring my and it's a group one over at her house or she had for years and years over thirty second street in Indian school and it would have you done\nI'm gonna give it a try or the other thing is I've had some great a Seventeen year old a ... pie\nYeah so what I Would probably do is just added an extra water and when it's real hot anytime it's above about a hundred and twelve\nYou know in the weeks and I would go ahead and fertilize which you know like say a lot of people don't fertilize I don't fertilize a lot of trees in my own yard but I Would fertilize them in February and may and uh September just go back to a standard fertilizing with a good citrus food like organic pro or another good set for his food and so you're saying\nDon't follow the three times a year deal\nNo that is following the three times a year ago [noise] okay I Know it depends what you know it was done are you using a ... year what even fertilizing with\nI use the ... I don't know the brand of it I find it loews I use the and Mueller stuff\nYeah you are if you're buying one of the commercial ones is not manufactured in this market or what you'd probably want to add to it as adds some soil sulfur\nAnd ... and I are in the late ...\nOkay and that's going to be something that most of the national varieties one lack that are more specific to our soil\nSo the best advice would be to buy one that's made for our climate the\nYeah that's why we liked the organic pro brand is because it's made here you know for the valley um we grow our citrus in our commercial groves hum and our main fertilizer we use there is a Hickman chicken manure\nAnd we by somebody else a chicken manure and we spread that in there and actually you could even put that on right now because it does take it a while to release it doesn't release very fast\nAnd because it's organic nitrogen has beaten by the bacteria and break down but we end up adding that and with our particular water out at our farm and hide or we use a lot of a magnesium ... too but you probably wouldn't need that here in town but\nYou know like that that hit ... a chicken manure if you would use that as your base and maybe give it a little extra ironed key late little sulfur you'd probably have the best fertilizer program you could have [noise]\nAll right I appreciate that thanks very thank you Bye bye\nLet's see next up we've got a gym in Phoenix good morning Jim\nConverting Hi um I'm\nCalling in to see to gather your opinion I guess on using um a hot seat Bush for privacy screening around the patio\nA gym I think it's an excellent idea for a short term if you're not going to have the house for a long if you're looking for something that's going to grow up really fast and cover it quickly\nAnd keep it for less than five years I think it'd be a great plant or in the long run I think there are much better plants that will be easier maintained and maintain a much denser you know better whatever liquor\nSorry well I was for example Okay Jim how tall you want your heads to be\nOh probably around eight feet about eight feet\nOkay so what are the old old standards here is our orange and salaries that\nAre a lot that sour orange in our I'm actually really they'll they'll sit for allowed\nNo citrus allowed even if they're ... ruined his Hedges huh right now those people are on Arizona's ... haven't they see in our state seal\nThe five seasons zone and they're making you next thing you know you can't have any copper in your yard no cattle run round out back either but anyway um so if you can't use that one um some some other ones to look for you want something dance and\nSecond and that tall um you could use a fight is which is going to be here and fight it's high it's going to want to get tower\nThere wants to look for you want something dancing thicket and that tall um you could use a fight is which is going to be here and fight its height is going to want to get taller now where are you located Jim across streets\nI'm thirty second street Lincoln\nThirty second street and Lincoln they won't let you have sour orange ... of those people were being tough in there now come on ... that's ... that's ... peak\nMan oh man it is yeah so um I don't think you'll be happy with the er and you're in real rocky soils to you know if you're if you're a patient you could grow or some of the ...\nAnd there's a Roman Myrtle that might be a little hard to find I could probably come up with them for you at the nursery that makes an excellent hedge at high will they let you have all of\n... ... you say yeah I think that what you have all of two and I haven't seen Rick ... yeah but so the olive they'll make a really\nNice dense hedge that you can share if you ... back and keep them as a dentist hedge they'll make a very nice ... you know in that soil in that area you're going to probably have a bit of a problem with Japanese privileged because it drains too fast for them\nUm so that probably wouldn't be one I Would recommend um [noise]\nYou know I I wouldn't look at the all of you know I Would look at the fight is if you want to keep them prove just going to stay on printing and if I guess the good part about using fight gets in your neighborhood your up the hill they're a little ways and it's pretty warm you don't have much of a process so that would be the fastest thing you could plant\nAnd uh you know for the hot seat you can do in but if you don't see many nice twenty year old hops you'd I just\nIt just going to live that long well they don't live that long and they get then people get tired of them they ... you know just over time they are just not a great long term plan\nOkay well let's say I'm Glad of cogent yeah come down to see us as a nurse or German or you're not far away we'll we'll show you all different kinds of options thank you very much thank you Bye bye ah Christine and why do good morning Christine\nMorning I caught the last week and then I was wrong about my orange tree main half alive and as the leaves curled up more\nIt turned out that the entire trunk as gr it'll buy 'em for a Rick ... cents on the photos to the Maricopa County extension plant hotline and Glenn right the ship is\nReally nice guy down in ... and he he\nCalled me up and he said well you're spending suffering from ... several years but that's not what killed it here I Am an opportunistic\nA market that will come in to weaken tree and I guess this particular season this week so now my question is I have a role of um\nCraze with a cap psycho law too\nAnd I'm Wondering what is it good size of ... to ... in that spot\nAnd how much of the root structure do I have to take it out before trying to plant\nWell you ... you know as far as trying to plant um pens on how big Diane with the trunk was never ... by hand or with a tractor but you know we felt like a twenty four inch box or thirty six inch box ... and you're just buying time buying an older tree and big difference in how fast they grow some some varieties lemons and lives in grapefruit and Angela grow fast\nOthers like naval orange grew very slow so it depends on how big you want the trees grow how fast you want to grow what culture where you might choose and then always was secrets you want to choose the variety that you enjoy but have you know it's probably the most important one\nThat I Would love is correct Cara but that is a naval type and that's probably growing\nPretty slow growing\nIt would pick out and my husband says a lemon lemon vibrant and they grow like Wade\nHe's not choosing you elements are vibrant and they do grill like it's OK\nWell thank you very nice\nFifty five Anglin's are very nice guy he works as water the Arizona department ah let's see uh art as surprised good morning art\nDo but I and I are\nMy call a I've got some oh yeah there is and they don't look a lot like are the ones in the neighborhood here as wondering if I Need to feed them or ...\nWell could be a couple of different things are are they are the leaves browning on them at all no they're not\nOkay so are they did they have read flowers when they bloom in the summer or just for a short time\nYet I've got flowers all that now for that matter you know\nBut it's just a real short looming cycle like for a month yeah that's a dwarf read all the end or aren't and it's just a more compact much slower growing plant doesn't flowers much in the nature of the plant that you have\nLike to get more leaves on\nA well fertilized them in water more and you can\nOr as much in the nature of the plant that you have like to get more leaves a\nA well fertilized them in water more and you can do both those things that's going to make them grow faster but they're never going to grow fast like some of the other culture parts do\nYeah the thing that they was wondering about is the uh the neighborhood I live and we have a lot of common area well hello yeah and there's and they're all the answers are needed water or anything\nLike art and art there are different variety they're not the same as yours okay yours if you want yours to grow fast in large like that you need to take him out and change in because you're varieties not going to grow fast like that\n[noise] okay thank you Bye bye are ready to take a short break we'll be right back with what Phil

investment performance online trading academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or registered investment advisor online training academy is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education enjoy the show [noise]\nHi this is Ken and you're on the right side of the trade between the black helicopters and CNBC there's the right side of the trade the right side of the rate is brought to buy online training academy Phoenix celebrating Twenty years is the world's most trusted name in professional trader education\nWell we just got back from our annual conference there are literally hundreds and hundreds of people who work with online training academy all over the world and it's always great to kind of once a year everybody gets together and you see a lot of old friends meet some new ones that whole thing but that is not why you tuned in to the show\nBut it it's actually it's a very exciting time for us and and in Phoenix particularly we're excited about a number of things a number of our staff WON Awards as being best in the world are operations manager Mary green one as the best operations manager in the world\nThose of you who are students I Know a will certainly respect that Mary finally got that\nAt well ward and got her do as someone who is just under a great job with helping students and making sure that we always have a very smoothly running operation\nBut also as a center once again we won what's called the brand champion award and there's a word has only been given three times and we have one at all three\nAnd then to me it's the most important in the words that are given out\nBecause of what it's about use we're the people that do the best job of representing the ideals of the company and the ideals of the companies are all about students' success and we really do it online trading economy Phoenix try to focus on the students' first\nAnd and the philosophy I've always tried to impart to people it's students center itself and the first thing that we have to do is focus on doing the right thing for the student then it's kind of we got to keep the lights on what do we do for the center and only at the end we really worried about the individual achievements and accolades\nAnd that is served as very well actually this week will be the the eighth year that I have owned the center there and uh we've come a long way and it is to do you guys as students listeners and all all the staff to just work so hard\nAnd so again I just wanted to kind of a shout out to everybody on the staffer for just all their hard work but\nAlso it made me think about what is it that\nWe do I think maybe differently than anybody else out there in the industry that makes us so successful and I will tell you if you look at overall reviews for online trading academy\nWhen students do their surveys after their their you know enroll in classes and whatnot what did you find out that for all the online trading academies worldwide of five stars\nSeven Ninety seven point one percent of them give either four or five stars\nNow of course in Phoenix is Ninety seven point seven to but whose but but you know are are good or Google a reviews we're four point nine out of five stars better Business Bureau with five stars out of five stars\nI'm you up at four and a half hour or five stars and we don't employ any kind of reputation management we don't pay people for reviews we don't give people discounts for right nice stop\nBut we really do make a commitment trying to help people and again going back to this idea well why am I talking about this one this important uh you know in in seven years of doing the show I've never really gotten into these issues but it's really the key is to wire students succeed\nIn the markets you know and I'm not sure I can get all these thoughts in in one show but I'm gonna try\nKey as to why our students succeed\nIn the markets you know and I and I'm not sure I can get all these thoughts in in one show but I'm gonna try if you really think about what it is that makes people successful or not successful it's not just knowledge and there's a lot of knowledge that's important to get into some of the knowledge during the show today\nAnd the values of the company are all about focusing on students' success and we work really really hard at it and it made me think about\nWhat is it that kind of we do I think well in supporting our students which took me to an even bigger question which was what is it really take to be successful in the markets and talked about in the first segment the first thing you have to understand is what the market's really are which\nIs totally different than what has been sold to us\nThey're not discounting mechanisms of future cash flow you cannot study a company's conference calls and know which companies are going to win and lose because first of all you're never going to know more than Goldman Sachs and city group and the people that run the companies\nThere's always going to be able to have an informational advantage so why should we try to compete where we have a weakness\nThe second part of it is is that the things that make a company successful change over time it's not just about the technology\nIs devoted to raise money the ability to market the ability to sell its about outs about sourcing and logistics it's about corporate culture it's about leadership it's about competitive response all things that change over time now one of the difficulties is\nThat the market's done nothing but go up essentially for nine years although maybe seen some change in that right now but when the market's going up every strategy works\nYou know back in the nineties is always talk about never confused genius with a bull market and I think there's a lot of risk and that today as well everybody that's been buying stocks and you know most people aren't doing great but they're doing kind of okay\nNow they have no real plan for what to do when the market goes down and that's like one of the really key pieces of information how do you not just survive when the market goes down but how do you thrive how do you develop a mindset to where you look forward to the opportunity of the market going down\nA conference one of the people I was talking to Jon O'Donnell's one of the founders of online trading academy he's our chief knowledge officer and I said so how do you do and he said just waiting for the crash so I can be short and that's how we view this and it's not that\nYou know we ... we wish harm to other people in the market to go down but we know the market's going to go down at some point and again you're starting to see some real weakness in rocky and his and\nMaybe this continues and maybe it's a reflection of interest rates and maybe as people worried about what happens after the election or any of thirty other things we've talked about on the show over the years\nBut there's a lot of things out there that one day have to come home to roost what we want to do is not dread that but just realize it's a fact of life\nAnd we want to be able to be successful when that happens we don't want to hope that we we we lose a bunch of money and then somehow over time we get it to come back\nThis the individual stocks almost never come back indexes come back because they're not the same stocks and this is something else that most people don't really understand about the market\nThey look at you know the Dow Jones industrial average in first they don't generally understand it's only thirty stocks and it's not really representative of of the market but okay\nFine but then they think that it's kind of always the same stocks but it's not the stocks in the index is get changed out regularly which means that companies that go bankrupt to perform poorly they go away and new socks come in so it's a marketing tool and it gets back to\nThe market is marketing it's people trying to convince you that this stock will get your clothes wider than white that this stock will make you more appealing to the opposite sex or whatever it may be and and I'm Serious that's what this is\nWhat happens is institutions buy stocks at low prices and this happens on an intra day basis and it happens on a very long term basis\nBut they buy the stocks when they're cheap they didn't tell you how wonderful they are they do other things as well to drive the prices of the stocks up and then they sell them to you would have high price and lo and behold like any retail industry they make money because what they're doing is buying something and selling it for more\nThe retail trade or loses because they buy too late in the cycle and they don't know how to make money when it goes down and they don't how to know how to recognize the signs\nThat the market is changing direction and again we're seeing some signs right now that we may be starting that process if you look at what's happening in ...\nIt is changing direction and again we're seeing some signs right now that we may be starting that process\nIf you look at what's happening in Asia stocks were getting whack pretty hard most of the Asian indexes are down at least ten percent so far this month some of them are down think China's down about thirty percent this year okay and this is the other thing that people don't fully grasp is\nThe market moves very very quickly to the down side and I'm explain why this is in class and why it's faster the downside than the upside but when the market's moving to the downside of people don't have time to react\nAs we've talked about on the show here before when the market plunged in two thousand and eight prices for the S. and P. five hundred went back to Nineteen Ninety six levels the market literally gave back Thirteen Years of profits in the year and a half and people were totally blindsided by it but\nThat money didn't disappear someone made that money somebody's sold before it went down some people did what's called go short which allows them to make money on those falls so this idea that the market crates and destroys wealth is wrong\nThere is an illusion of wealth creation there's an illusion of wealth destruction and explain to you how you see past that I mean really when you come to the half the class is and I don't remember which one is it gets the red pills that you take the matrix whatever color pill you take that it allows you to see the reality of life\nThat's what happens when you come to the half day class now the problem is is you can't go back okay can't be like Joe ... Antonio or whatever his name is and then be able to go out and eat steak because you're just being set up but just or if you've seen the matrix\nBut if you want to come out to class and really understand how you can succeed in the market you can get to free tickets in a free tablet by being one of the next dozen callers\nAnd aid for for eight eight seven twenty three thirty seven you can also get the tickets and the tablet by\nTexting the letters O.

Phoenix that's because of how we select our diamonds we go to the three diamond capitals of the world and pork Tel Aviv andme Mumbai where the diamonds or touch\nPolish and Vince sorted by their GI

guiding light a light that shines brightest when wearing bell bottoms under a disco ball [laughter] I Know mom wouldn't want us to cry now she want us to dance\nYou know what a wide where where's the top in this market\nSo so with currencies are wanted these currencies are just kind of middle of the pack right now and you can make money on these very quickly in both directions as well so we want to understand what the right instrument is for us to be invested in trading in\nAnd understand again this probability risk manager and meant and using the leverage to make our money worked for us again harder than we worked for it so again these are all the kinds of ideas that we teach in our classes\nIt's what I'm going to do if you come out to the half the class as well now the next set of skills that we really want to think about is people you know think about well you know this is so specialized I'm just going to let my adviser handled this with all due respect there's some people out there that advisors that are good people trying to do the right thing\nBut the reality is the vast majority of them are simply commission sales people they are drug reps masquerading as doctors they are selling you what will make them the most money not necessarily what is best for you\nThe reason they sell you a new release is that is the highest commission product that's out there okay you're paying in many cases eight eight and a half percent up front\nYou can't get your money out for years without a penalty you're giving up a huge percentage in some cases maybe over Ninety percent of the profits that are making on your money and you're taking the risk how does that make any sense\nOkay when they're selling you stocks are selling you I mean these big banks literally have meetings on Monday Mornings or every morning and they tell their people here's what we're going to sell today\nAnd how is it that that is in your best interests to have those people making decisions with your money and and one of the things I always try to get across to people as look\nEverybody's looking out for themselves okay you and your advisors aren't bad people but they've got to feed their kids to and so when it comes down to what's best for you and what's best for them part of what's best for them as what he's the most commission part of what's best for them is what's going to keep their boss off their back\nYou know and by the way you know when the market's going down and one of the reasons people take these big losses is their visors always tell them hey you know don't sell now why did they tell you not to sell they tell you it's because the stocks always come back\nBut understand stocks themselves don't generally come back when indexes comeback it can take Fifteen or Twenty years why would you give up half of your investing life potential because most people thirty five or forty years give up half of it hoping to break even how is that is your best interest\nThe reason they tell you that is that as long as you own stocks you won't take your money out of the account and they can keep generating fees the minute you go to cash you might take your money out that's why they
