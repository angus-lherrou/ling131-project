that\nJuniors are not put on JV the district gives preference on JV to freshmen and sophomores who have more years to polish their talents\nTheir son is a ... or excuse me as a junior junior in high school and he did not make the varsity the coach said he was on the bubble and because he did not make varsity they want him to be able to play JV the district said no\nJuniors don't play on JV mom and step dad zipped down to an attorney filed the lawsuit were suing and they lost\nThe the the the suit on the grounds of age discrimination\nFor an hour and a junior in a senior and sex discrimination\nBecause they say that the district historically let's female juniors play on the girls JV team well you won't let male juniors play on the male GB team as well but it seems like a bit of an inconsistency and you also have um\nThe age you know so just because my my kid is a junior it prevents him from being on the JV team\nBecause you and you listen I'm not going to be the lawsuit is ridiculous don't get me wrong\nBut it is kind of interesting I mean I guess when you think about it this way because you can move up you can jump up the ladder but basically they're saying you can't fall down the ladder so if you're a sophomore but it didn't fall down is actually making a lot of moved well he he maxed out and he maxed out at the BP he can't make it to the ...\nBecause you have a sophomore play on the varsity team which can have a senior play on the fresh for using um\nYeah I mean I get the point you got to go up I get the point that's being made but I think that it's actually really hurting this cat and I feel for them it's hurting them because you have mom and step\nDad that have filed this lawsuit of which they lost in federal court because they lost with the superintendent they lost with the district and they lost with the school\nAnd now even though in court docks he's referred to as John Doe and mom is referred to as Jane Doe body out of school we know who this is so in that school for the I can only imagine what his daily existence is like in high school where kids are absolutely\nBrutal I feel for the cat I honestly do\nThere are a lot of kids that have their goals on making varsity and it does and that doesn't mean you sue your kid can still play ball he can go and play for summer rec team or club or whatever it may be it just may not be the team that he wants to be on and\nUnfortunately that happens in life\nAnd this is this is them trying to protect him or shield him from the harsh realities that you're not going to win it everything\nAnd you know what I I think that it will force the district to take a look at their policies because it does seem strange to me\nThat if a junior girls can play on JV why can a junior boy I play on JV I'd be making the same argument if it were a junior girls who wanted to play on JV and they weren't allowed but they allowed the boys to like good for the goose good\nFor the gander or
