it's the foundation of who we are but as long as we continue to use immigration as as long as it continues to be used as a political issue we're not going to get to any meaningful solutions we're\nTalking with the Democratic candidate for governor of Arizona David Garcia our conversation continues in just a moment but just like we did with the governor to do so you were a nobody stands and the way of detour Dan right and here he is from the valley Chevy dealer traffic center\nAfter I'd be glad you're in Studio damage because there is a dangerous road way out there that somewhere out there we are going to find one but it doesn't look like fat as they could be north found on the set of genes green way that is where we've got a reckoning on rap and it's also been moved off right Wes found us sixteen your\nSchool there's a crash off left up against that median off but it's got all lanes open I just don't like the way you're squeezing out each of Elaine\nI lean to the right if I were you for seventh avenue ... got crashed just trying to deport Roger you by the mortgage the increased property values meaning might be able to finally drop your mortgage insurance asked a lot more you see now you can start saving hundreds of dollars every month Scott sixty three eight seven five Ninety nine forty today ... ...\nWe've got a chance shower still today partly cloudy skies and a high of Seventy one partly cloudy tonight a low fifty seven in the sunshine and Seventy eight for tomorrow your weather's brought you by Howard air whether replace repair called our air [noise]\nArizona heard of that ad our guest is we've been saying already this morning at David Garcia the Democratic candidate\nFor governor of Arizona ah All right so we've talked about the border and we have a we talked about the you know how your campaign has been going let's talk about education 'cause this is a you know you've been really the education candidate or from the start uh I Know the Arizona teachers it's not a union is association here but they are associated with the the\nThe Arizona the water national Education Association a tad a Jew from the start so would you like to see a larger raise for teachers than the twenty percent that they've been promised I realized that teachers are going to get twenty percent and uh this could go away in some way shape or form and are you willing to raise taxes in the future to uh to fund schools\nYeah I appreciate this question because this is the question Arizona to talk about when I'm Out on the road folks when they get face to face they talk a lot about public education\nLike a what we need to do in this state is treat our teachers like professionals and we're not treating them like professional today\nIt means we need to pay them as professionals that don't have to work two or three jobs to stay in the classroom\nIt's not a profession as long as you have to work two or three jobs to stay in the classroom\nBut in addition we've got to get back to teaching again who doesn't cost any money getting away from standardized tests and back to teaching real world outcomes is something we can do and it'll change our teaching and learning in the classroom also get our students ready for life or after high school which is what we need to focus\nOn do we need to measure the also the progress and and dumped doesn't don't standardized test to a certain extent do that I agree we don't want to teach to test but don't we need standardized tests well\nIs not about not taken the test okay so this is about it not counting for almost everything right and not a difficult concept right you take the test it counts for part of how we evaluate school what's happening right now\n... what's happening right now it counts for almost all of how we evaluate schools so this this is not you've you've taken a class where the final was the entire great that's a little of what we've got going on right now you've taken a class where the Bible was part of the great it's it's a straightforward shift in that you know in that direction\nUm and from my perspective is those kinds of outcomes we need to change\nYou know Arizona the one thing that if you look at at our state if we want to put us on a different trajectory it is about investing in education it comes up over and over and over again so are you willing to raise taxes we we've got a specific for full plan to get this thing done number one\nWe need to prioritize new revenue into education and stop cutting so that the revenue coming in can be prioritized to education\nSecond we've got tax credits in Arizona that still continue to take dollars out of the general fund and put 'em in the private schools that that that need to be close\nThird we got tax exemptions loopholes that we've got to look at carefully and ask ourselves or the still in the best interest of the state or should these dollars go to the general fund and investing in education\nAnd then last Arizona's two hundred and Seventy thousand of them signed an initiative for a dedicated revenue source for education it was taken off the ballot by the Supreme Court but I Believe Arizona and are ready\nFor a dedicated revenue source that's what our teachers are looking for because uh you know if not then any future legislature can continue to hack it public education that dedicated revenue sources important I'm In favor of going to the legislature to put strict put one together or if necessary go back to the people of Arizona\nWith every year first task is governors to introduce a bill that would fully fund and your opinions school\nI put those in I just put those in basically in order and that order is you take an existing revenue prioritize education you take advantage of every possibility unique existing state budget through tax credits through other exemptions and see how far that gets you and then ask yourself ask ourselves do can we can we closed the rats with an initiative\nYou know we the teachers out there when they eat and after four years I'm not saying enough\nIs the what happened was you know the governor at that point it offered them a two percent raise over four years nowhere near what we need even with some investment today we are still eight hundred million dollar short of two thousand eight level\nOr they were being left behind with respect to education and it's not just by the way to K. twelve level if you look at high tech jobs in Arizona we want to bring in quality jobs they almost exclusively come in tied to one of our higher education institutions\nThe universities in the community colleges and investing in that level of education is a great investment in Arizona's economic future\nWe have a couple of minutes left here with a democratic candidate David Garcia for the governorship of Arizona how hard is it to campaign for change or when the economy is doing so well I mean\nWhether Doug juicy deserves any credit for that or not um things look overall pretty good at least compared to a you know last ten years or here in Arizona how hard is it to the campaign for something like ... it's\nIt's not difficult at all because that is making its way down there every day Arizona it's um I have for example we had a very good volunteered given us a hand he was a teacher\nHad to stop because he needed to go take a second job because he couldn't stay in the classroom that that that progress that prosperity is not making a down to everyday Arizona and\nThey are working two three jobs to make ends meet we do have a job coming into Arizona a lot of lower wage service level jobs for example\nAnd folks are looking for a future are looking for a path with themselves and for their families you talked to families by the way and they know their schools are in trouble um because of funding they are they without a bond or override which is what they're fighting for they know that the legislature isn't doing their job and they're looking for some leadership\nYou go out to rural Arizona and the prosperity you're just talking about doesn't exist out there\nThese are folks looking for an opportunity just to keep their towns alive focusing on water and natural resources by the way which is a very big issue outside of Maricopa County um and there's very little discussion going on in those areas so the the prosperity you're talking about is really centralized at the top and is not making its way down to everyday Arizona\nThe other one of those places where I grew up I spent about some of my years growing up on the Navajo Nation and uh with uh the Navajo generating station possibly closing a a you know the the revenue that the Hopi Amitava both get from the coal up there uh it might dry up and these are the best paying jobs by far in that area are are you\nAre you okay with ah with with coal energy with was somewhat dirty energy if it helps to keep some of these rural areas of afloat this\nA great example of investment in in using education I'm In favor of adjust transition\nAway from the Navajo generating station and that means that those most impacted by that transition get an opportunity to get to the front of the line get retrained retool and be on the front end of an economy there is an opportunity up a Navajo to shift towards solar and the a place to where it can be done\nFocusing on an investment in solar programs for example that DNA college\nThat can get folks who are going to be impacted get them on the front end retrain them put them in a position to learn to ... to ... to ... to uh maintain and install solar and I think you can see a transition to a new economy up there\nAnd he was in Saudi Arabia meeting with the king and the new reports that Turkish police have found evidence that Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate there\nKatie a our eyes on immigration President Trump tweeted this morning he's informed the president of Honduras that unless a caravan of migrants heading to the U.S has stopped the U.S will stop giving aid to Honduras effective immediately\nYou're never more than Fifteen minutes away from today's top stories on Arizona's new station Katie a our news [noise]\n[noise] [noise] All right so David Garcia just joined us a few minutes ago here on Arizona's morning news the\nDemocratic candidate for governor we have the governor\nWho is wanting a second term on with this last Thursday and the same time frame the same amount of time you don't want to keep everything fair here right\nAnd one of the things we talked we talked about the border uh we talked about or something that he's answered before which is that uh he says he doesn't want to just abolish ice and have nothing in place he has some ideas on how he wants to reform the immigration system which of course governor has very very limited say and that I mean they can just basically\nYou know petition their members of Congress and a and the and the president and these kind of things but the education that is a part that's something that the the governor has a big say in\nAnd uh one of the things we talked about was whether or not to David Garcia would raise taxes in order to fund education um you know governor do see it promised to twenty percent to raise a don't knows everybody's going to get that but that's what he's promised and here's Garcia on education from earlier this morning\nYou know Arizona the one thing that if you look at at our state if we want to put us on a different trajectory it is about investing in education it comes up over and over and over again\nSo are you willing to raise taxes oh we\nWe we've got a specific for full plan to get this thing done number one we need to prioritize new revenue into education and stop cutting so that the revenue coming in can be prioritized to education\nSecond we've got tax credits in Arizona that still continue to take dollars out of the general fund and put them in the private schools that that that need to be closed\nThird we got tax exemptions loopholes that we've got to look at carefully and ask ourselves or the still in the best interest of the state or should the dollars go to the general fund in investing in education\nAnd then last Arizona's two hundred and Seventy thousand of them signed an initiative for a dedicated revenue source for education\nIt was taken off the ballot by the Supreme Court but I Believe Arizona and are ready for a dedicated revenue source that's what our teachers are looking for because you know if not then any future legislature can continue to hack in public education that dedicated revenue sources important\nI'm In favor of going to the legislature to put ... put one together or if necessary go back to the people of Arizona\nWhatever you're All right so I'm gonna cut myself off their uh because I'm used to everybody in my house doing it um [noise]\nWe basically he said yes so because we had a text that came and Jamie right and I am I wrong unless somebody said he did not answer the question of whether or not he would raise tax write\nSo he basically said yes and here's why because he talked about the limiting tax credits and eliminating tax exemptions which would raise the taxes effectively on some people and he mentioned this initiative that had been thrown off the ballot\nBy the uh by the Arizona Supreme Court\nThat would have created as he put it a dedicated revenue source for education which of course would raise taxes\nOn on on upper income earners nonetheless that is a raising of taxes so the answer is yes\nEven though you're in here yes come out of his mouth when I asked are you willing to raise taxes the answer's yes okay just wanted to put that out there 'cause some people are like you didn't answer the question yes he did\nHe didn't answer the question he just didn't answer it with a simple yes All right so there you go uh we have more on David Garcia's

one tries gotcha thing they have their scripted response so we can all the church is this that there was a kabuki theater going on with debates in general\nAnd so the only way that you can win or dare I say lose a debate is to be unprepared for something that happens or literally pass out in the middle of the debate hit your head on the lectern\nAnd end up on the stage and then people go I\nDon't think it was kinda close but the one that won the you know what I'm saying why do we have the the ... pretty low neither\nCongresswoman mix Sally nor congresswoman cinema passed out hit their head an
