vote may\nNot be the way they vote in the final one\nSister Kennedy [noise]\nIs clear which are the roll call vote are happening just moments ago as all one hundred senators will hold as to [noise]\nUm this latest procedural voted and enlisted I mentioned his resume sharp a little bit ago pedal last thing I Want to do is turn this into high school civics class again but there is there is some how the Senate works type stuff that I think is important because I can acknowledge and realize that most of you have real lives\nAnd that you are probably not hanging on the every word of the everything that happens inside the Senate you're genuinely concerned about the uh today's or this morning's vote the vote that happened in the last hour does not in a tea does not confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court it caught a cloture vote\nNow I don't expect anybody to know what that is and I really worked hard to get a very dumb down version of a definition of a cloture vote cloture for dummies me\nOh if you're using it\nFor a dummy calls ... culture is basically a vote to go ahead with a vote yes it's it's Senate rules procedural oddity okay so what happened today was we're going to be that we want to go forward with\nA guy that that's all this and it's like it's like having a meaning to schedule your neck\nThank you yeah that that's a good analogy okay so they're going to vote of the vote and this is procedural which means they have thirty hours yes the clock is in fact ... talking taking talking a clicking away asked they've got three hours to debate this and then\nThey will be a vote now what happened to not vote\nThat's so clear this is a a very good indication of course of where things stand tomorrow and it's hard to believe at this point that any senator wouldn't have made up his or her mind they were forced to cast his ballot today again the surprises including Republican senator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski voting no and a Democrat from West Virginia\nJoe Manchin voting yes that keeps the Senate at fifty one forty nine a majority for advancement it's hard to believe that centers don't know at this point where they stand\nAnd that also means we can afford to lose one more vote for because of it ends up as a fifty fifty ... vice president Pence comes in and breaks the tie a I won't I won't make you guess how he\nWould yeah right

illegal but you know what are the harmful effects and you're modeling behavior for your kids but\nThere is this idea of\n... and you even you know before that like if you have a teenager and I know this is all very illegal folks but we're playing ... hypothetical matter because it's also reality\nIf you have a teenager and they have um a a a beer ... okay let's stay in front of them and they have um a joint you know to the cigarette\nAs [laughter] okay [noise] um they're both\nBad they're both ... what are the lesser of the two evils if your child chose to consume that\nAre and and the code anecdotally I Know people who have had who who drink alcohol and the problems associated with that\nAnd people who smoke marijuana and yes there are problems associated with that and my perception Pamela is marijuana use the less dangerous of the two at least in the long term\nNot for teenagers okay not for teenagers to carry out now that their brains because they're still developing are so much more vulnerable to the effects of marijuana more so than alcohol\nSo is there danger supposed to flip over [laughter] I honestly I don't know I look at odds with side there were there\nWere a thirty eight hundred adolescence this huge huge study that was done in the American Journal of psychiatry and in order to get true results of this if they were participating in the study\nThey agreed um that they they wouldn't be sharing information with mom and dad or any other authorities so that they could get like the real data from it and then they went through a period of time and they were I'm taking a look at some like cognitive tests of these scenes\nThey're looking at memory recall you know the reasoning short term memory things along those lines and what they found out is that kids using pot regularly\nCould suffer laughing repercussions in their thinking ability that marijuana has he more damaging effect on teenager as long term cognitive abilities more so than that alcohol that beer\nMm no I mean just to a certain extent I can get through that makes sense and getting to be very clear ... both of them have negative effect\nI salute rating on the ... absolutely absolutely we are on\nAnd and I guess just anecdotally I look at it I've seen just let me put it this way I see so many more lives destroyed\nBy ... by marijuana that's my ...\nAnd I and I understand that and I know the stories that you're referencing and I've been around people that use ... okay I guess my my pushback according to this data though Bruce is a lot of those people that you've been around I'm assuming they've been using it as adults fair enough yeah\nThey I don't remember but in my teenage years no one was smoking marijuana and if you if they were looking at a young
