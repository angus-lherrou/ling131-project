this morning that uh he has every right constitutionally I I think to do so um but at the time in the south to a head of his visit here to the valley\nWell as you know the president's coming to Arizona it has been a state that not only support if the president in the primaries and the general election was one of the key states as we launched the campaign to steal a massive outpouring of support\nFor President Trump and you remember the first rallies we get down there and we stood up we had to keep ... done many many airport rally but this is an issue and you know there's that anyone\nThat directly affects the people of Arizona if we can control our borders were not a nation Ronald Reagan talked about it in the eighties and every other nation in the world has the right to control who comes across the border and if you come across borders\nIn the eighties and every other nation in the world has the right to control who comes across the border and if you come across borders illegally and other places here to count ability but for some reason\nThe Democrats in our country think it's OK to leave open borders and this president said it will not be tolerated and we will use every means possible to prevent people from coming to our country illegally and that's the job of the presidents to protect us from all enemies both foreign and domestic\nYou know we've we've seen the national guard on the border but we haven't seen you know the the the currently serving you a U.S army or Marines or anything like that actually a deployed at the border that is a ... that is a distinct change or do you think the American people are ready for something like that court Lewandowski\nI I think the American people are absolutely ready to ensure that the people who are coming into our country doing so legally unlawfully\nAnd if that means that we have to put our troops on the border to make sure that that's happening that is what takes place around the world you can't go to Israel and not go through a checkpoint you make sure that you're coming into the country legally you can't go to other countries\nAnd not make sure you're coming to that country illegally were they have armed guards in many places if not all of those places to make sure that they're protecting the sovereignty of their country why should be any different and while the the National Guard has been a phenomenal job\nThis notion that this caravan is coming from Mexico and is going to just break in for lack of a better term into the United states and put a burden on our system and potentially cause crimes and our country is one that this president will not tolerate and his up to him\nAnd under the discretion that he has as a beach officer of our military commander in chief to use the resources necessary to protect American people and this is a good use of those resources\nWe're talking with a former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski about the president's visit here and his tweet this morning where he threatened to shut down the U.S border is there a strategy here is is this something tactical what he's doing here sending out to this ... this tweet or or is this just the president being the president that little impulsive\n[noise] no I think is very tactical I think what they've said is is Mexico isn't willing to help prevent this from happening and his records with that ... who can't allow other countries to ah to give permission to pass through to come to our country illegally we do a lot of business with Mexico and\nIt's very important that they understand that there are consequences to actions they have the ability to help stop this caravan from coming through ... within their own borders they cannot sanctions that they cannot allow it and what the president is asking for\nIs help from our friends to make sure that they don't allow that caravan to come through Mexico has a big giant wall on their southern border\nWe should not expect anything less nobody is better than we are so she got the same rights as every other country which means\nIf you want to come here there was a process there is a way to do it properly and this president going

Democrats for being weak on enforcement and using the issue to rally his Republican base heading into the mid term elections\nThe president threatening on Twitter in all caps to quote close our southern border with Mexico doesn't stop what he calls an onslaught\nWhat's intact about two thousand migrants who fled Honduras and are making their way north and the caravan Mexico has said that migrants that have proper documents can enter that country but those who don't have to apply for refugee status or face deportation\nAll right so I'm a as usual this is this is ... has its underpinnings and racism I I get why this plays well to a base to build the wall kick the Mexicans out part but um how\nExactly would be military on our so let's go back to what you just said there would you say about racial underpinning hum I don't believe that because well I'm not I've never heard of talking about Canadians coming in ... well well because ... Canadians\nThey aren't loading up busloads of bands of thousands of people coming into this country illegally so I guess I just want to push back on that a little bit not embrace was I'm not going to buy my book over one of the discussion about it\nI Believe something has to be done now is it militarized wing our border going to shoot him when I finish isn't militarized wing or border I don't know if that's the answer because yes it leads itself to questions like what are you going to do to shoot him can you close the border it's surprising\nThat's the answer because yes it leads itself to questions like what are you going to do to shoot him can you close the border it's a present he can do what he wants it to a certain degree but there is an issue and it appears as though\nThings like legalize marijuana and other drugs and impairment fact\nWell you say legalize marijuana I mean you look at Canada for instance yesterday recreational marijuana became legal within like\nEverywhere I'm Sorry the partner look around Arizona and you've got you know California to our west and about and so and so forth that have legalized recreational marijuana and you got a lot of folks are saying it's just a matter of time before it happens here\nWe don't have medical marijuana and one of the questions that even Colorado has grappled with ever since they became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana\nIs how do you test for pot in particular because it's not like alcohol if you are impaired the alcohol I mean you can take a breathalyzer test every police car the newsletter around right now on a valley road has that\nWe understand that if you if you have if you you you blow a whatever you know a lot of times it's also obvious like you would need a breathalyzer going the guy can barely stand up be slurring his words this person's obviously drunk\nBut with marijuana in particular you've got things like metabolites you could have smoke last night you're not necessarily impaired now that if you were to take a drug test it would still show\nSo when you talk about construction workers in particular\nYou think about it like this you gotta hypothetical gotten Mike Mike okay shows up in the morning got it I haven't read moving a little slow responding slower than usual you think you know what\nHe's high yeah like it's going to affect his quality of work so what do you do well you're worrying about his physical safety the safety of others the logical step would be telling like to take a drug test right\nIt's it's not quite that simple you have them you know they'll ... somewhere and send them home because you're concerned and it might take up to like three days for you to get there was ...\nSo that the test came back negative you make out of work for three days and give it actually sue you for lost wages\nAnd you didn't even take into consideration that makes the news that oh and might get much sleep last night then you waiting factor there is a new focus\nThat look at the ... instead of like looking at the cause impairment drugs alcohol even like asleep and the KKK employers should focus on the impairment itself I think that makes loads of sense it makes loads of sense he could have starting to see a shift more towards this kind of poll well working backwards\nIf you are an employer and you have employees that that may be doing things that are dangerous to themselves or others OK I'm leaving you poor sales people are sitting in a cubicle right now I'm\nYour concern is safety right I mean you know kind of at the very end it's it's the the safety of employee or the safety of customers or safety of the general public ... you could argue for liability reasons or just because you really like ... whatever it might be\nA concern of safety difference does the impairment make\nWhat difference does why they're impaired make is if it is lack of sleep all the way up to opioid abuse what difference does it make if they are dangerous the job right right exactly work backwards or you impaired yes or no why are you part of it\n[noise] so yeah maybe thinking that you know and it's gonna be really hard to test for impairment on like
