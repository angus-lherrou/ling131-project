realized that I didn't get my kids their flu shots and by the time it was getting really bad it was almost too late to get their flu shots and so I felt horrible I felt like the worst mother and the world where my mom ever\n... so I made sure that they would definitely get the flu shot this year and already burst there are cases here in Arizona in fact according to the Arizona health department there is a lot so check this out\nSo we got our first week worth of numbers and we have had thirty cases of the flu recorded in the state of Arizona\nAnd here we got him he has on a health department talking about the vaccination\nAt our concern is is is that a vaccination level decreases below a certain threshold it puts those he wouldn't normally be at risk at risk for getting those particular diseases\nHigh seas or lifted okay you're showing\nThe herd immunity argument right there is that's not a joke as measured what it's called that if the number of\nPeople who are vaccinated falls below a certain level it is it is it is dangerous you know I Want to encourage all of you know to go down your your flu shot oh I guess you go do it [laughter] I'm so hard no well\nIt's okay you can be a hard now and if you happen to get the flu everybody here will hate you for a little while 'cause you'll get them all sick and they go home and get sick\nI disagree with that first off you if you get your flu shot you'll be fine\nWhat do you what do you care about and we did have the flu shot shot clinic here that I avoided [laughter] like the plague speaking of another ...\nNo I'm hardly alone let's be honest I'm hardly alone now here's one of the things and I am not a conspiracy theorist or not but uh I've always heard that that that getting the flu shot is not a guarantee you won't get ... of course that's that says viruses mutate OK mhm number one\nYes those I'm asking questions because I may not know this you may not know the answers to but you're a lawyer so I Want you act like you're a doctor just be very different definitive in your answers got it\nCan I get the flu from getting a flu shot no okay I thought for some reason that might have been a medium there\nI have read many places where it says no you cannot get the less surveying Chavez most if not all flu shots from what I've read\nA lonely planet doctor now what I Do read a does not carry the live germ or whatever that are being okay um and so that's a question that a lot of parents ask I don't want to take my kid end to get a flu shot if you're giving them a live flu germ right into the bloodstream\nBut I've also heard the argument well it by the time we get the flu shot the viruses already mutated so is that flu shot going to\nDo and you guys already ineffective right kind of like computers are outdated the menu by them can the flu shot make me Ralph\nYes because my son is seven years old and got his shot and within Fifteen minutes of getting his shot he threw up in the basic
