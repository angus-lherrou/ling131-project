just go and the reason I say that is that you don't have any devices that have gone off\nSo the question and I don't know the answer to this are they actually real ... are are they set up to actually explode maybe they have bomb components to them but are they really wired to go off\nA ... you know the I Will tell you the bomb techs will know that at this point that they'll also know that he's a sophisticated or unsophisticated as far as a bomb maker I think it's going to be the ladder\nUm and the combination of what you may get off of all these bombs like DNA fingerprints a unique perhaps characteristics of the bombs in other words let's say he used a clock or digital clock that is super unique you might be able to run down where it came from\nA but you're also going to have to look at how it got to these locations\nJak or your hand delivered or went through the mail but all those give you a potential through cameras and people to interview as to how those the package actually got to its location\nYet you don't have stamps on it but I've been hearing that possibly this did not go through the u._s. mail\nRight right I mean he may have a set up all these packages to be exactly alike ... got the address is down and then said ... maybe I shouldn't put them in the mail and figure it out either delivered by hand which I think is definitely the case was George Soros\nA ... is CNN the the the discussion is that it that might have been a career but again that gives you some avenue to investigate somebody had to hand it off to it obviously right right so so we'll have to say but a lot to work with here if you're the investigators\nOr we're talking with former FBI agent Brad Garrett who is a terrorism analyst crime analyst for ABC News I read a lot of people are assuming because of the targets chosen by this bomber or potential bombers that it must be somebody who's a an extreme right winger but law enforcement really can't assume anything can be\nNo ... they certainly cannot assume anything uh you know the the the real issue here is in a you don't ... let's just say for example that the maybe these bonds are operational that doesn't mean he can't have bombs that are going to have bombs that are operational\nWe don't know who else who he's he's mailed or delivery bombs to at this point uh and that's I think obviously the big concern and clearly the

from now or glass they think some of them had glasses\nKind of like the I eat these we hear from Iraq or Afghanistan\nIf your intent was to just scare yeah why do you send a live device because from even though none of them have exploded we're being told they have had the capability they ... they didn't just look like one guy said well I mean it wasn't just the shore\nSo they have the capability to explode okay and why would you go through a the capability to explode and be putting in these extra projectiles for\nFor more damage if you've never had the intent of them going off\nYour ... why

than who I Choose to vote in or out of office whether it's the oval office whether it's on Congress whether it's in my local school board the only power I have over politicians as my vote so another reason why you need to get out and vote on Tuesday November sick\nBut we had ... who do you vote for who isn't one of these bomb throwing looms\nThat things are not the only that's only part of the equation in my opinion I Can't change other people's behavior the only behavior that I can change is my own so for me I think that we need to stop\nHow does this does it stop by politicians toning down their rhetoric and the temperature sure but we really have no control over that for me it stops by us refusing to listen to it and expecting more from them\nAnd by refusing to listen to it and expecting more from them that comes to what we can control when we talk to family members when we talk to\nFriends who come out an issue from a different political side than we do instead of digging in our heels reach out your hand and have a conversation\nInstead of retreating to your reflective side see if you can learn something from it it can get loud it can get heated but keep a respectful because that's where you grow that's where you learned that's how this changes\nI Can't change with the president says at a rally or what Maxine Waters says at a rally but if we keep rewarding bad behavior we're going to see more of\nCongressmen and senators shot on softball fields as well as more of these bombs being sent to political individuals it's unacceptable and it needs to stop and I think we have the power to do that\nI think that was a wonderful speech I think it has actually no bearing on the world we live and\nSee what that's the problem Bruce that mentality right there is the problem\nPeople have their own truth\nThat is the problem they don't they they agree with him I don't believe that as long as it doesn't require them to do anything differently whatsoever you know how many idiots and I called them idiots I've watched I've just made a post on Facebook making fun of them\nAbout all the people that claimed this was a false for social media and and that and it may be this big bully that why would see them and take a picture of business obvious if they're making this up and you know here's the wind of it why they have their own truth I think they're ignorant I think they're uninformed\nAnd they have no desire whatsoever to learn anything new to stop it knowledge ing them stop acknowledging the trolls stop acknowledging the individuals who you say are idiots stopped giving power to the politicians\nThat are ramping up the rhetoric and then they'll stop doing it I Do believe that they don't do you have trials if you keep feeding the trolls if you just waiting the negativity expelling whatever you feed it to grow stop\nFeeding it we want you to chime in on the open Mike line six so to two hundred two seven three three where does this change
