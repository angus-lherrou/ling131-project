real far as what you want to talk about an hour ... here to tell us about what is behind ...\nThe reason this teacher from Mesa was on my front doorstep is because the things about education as early that's correct yeah so what does this do exactly ...\nBasically it is an expansion of something that's currently already in place so as of now\nThere is a certain amount of students that is allowed or are they can qualify for these empowerment scholarships and um if a child has a disability or if they come from a lower income area or their parents are in military or something along those lines\nAnd as of now there's a certain amount of um students in Arizona if this were to be expanded it would go into place you expand over the next four years to one point one million airs on the students'\nStudents' you aren't necessarily just said ... okay so automatically when you talk to them plenty of people who were for this and against us yeah\nAnd if both sides it's hard talking to a parent with a child that has a disability and why they need this can be very ... you you feel for them and um I spoke to Jenny Clark her son has dyslexia and described yet and their family uses this and um she ... she told me\nWe know that kids are not one size fits all not every child fit in a district or a charter school and we believe that all children should have the opportunity to make that choice and\nShe told me that with further research there was not a school in their public school district that had\nCertain services for her son to um go to school and be treated for his dyslexia and describe yet so that is a very compelling side and then you also have I'm not only save our schools Arizona but just public education backers\nThat are saying well where is this money coming from and we serve Ninety five percent of students and why can't we just work with these parents things of that nature and so I'm I spoke with Don ... who\nHad plenty of things to say about how this is a waste of taxpayer money and how public education is already very underfunded in Arizona this is only going to do more damage and things of that nature so\nUm I mean just as you we all know here at the station education is that a lot of attention on it lately and this prop is just keeping that conversation alive\nYou know it's interesting though are one question I uh I Would like answered it and I don't know what the answer is when there's a lot of those answers on this or are they going to take the same amount of money that would go to a kid or to the kids to public school and use that same money to go to the private school there by\nYou know the public schools are going to have to educate kids so why should they get the money for\nIt you know so there's a lot of questions about the

David Garcia\nUh we've been talking a little bit about education and who you're talking about some other things must continue on education which is the second here because here's a question I have it as the husband of a public school teacher\nUm she's not convinced that just giving raises the teachers is going to improve schools I mean there's other things have to happen uh and she's not nests she's not for a you're not for or against three o five necessarily but\nDo we need to do more when it comes to public school besides just giving teachers arranged\nOh absolutely and I want to say thank you to Mrs sharp for the good work that she does inside the classroom and our teachers do do a really good job our kids are improving fast and math and reading in Arizona\nThan any other kids in the country and I want our teachers to receive more credit for that but it's more than just teacher pay increases that's why we were stored additional assistance\nA hundred million dollars last year and three hundred and Seventy one million dollars over the next four years and Jim you and I probably would agree it's not just resources and money it's also reforms that are going to bring results in outcomes\nInside the classroom I'm someone who believes in school choice I Want to pay for it to be able to send their child where they want to send them and that's why I'm a yes on prop thrill five\nI talked about this a little bit during the debates there's a a a young man Jordan visitor who has cerebral palsy and autism\nHis mother Kathy has been able to access educational therapy because of these e essays educational savings because this is going to expand and beyond that it's going to expand it and it should be expanded why would we want to have a limited when Arizona children needed I told the story about the young man a Adonis why he's a freshman\nOr blind individual he scored two touchdowns in his freshman football\nGames or his he essays go to buy his braille books my opponent would take those braille books away\nTake away the options for Jordan visitor there are certain populations that are specified under code but parents have those needs so the essay if it is expanded its limited and it's incremental that's how you move good policy forward we can bring additional resources and do our traditional K. twelve\nSystem and provide options for teachers [noise]\nAh All right so now under the border of we can't uh can't afford the border because we have a very large one with or Mexico or your opponent David Garcia says that your borders strike force isn't all that effective and he's a cited some weather events\nReporters lapses on patrols along the border due to lack of funding ... are there are times when the border and areas around it the aren't being patrol the that are allowing people crossing illegally I'm going to mention one more thing uh the border patrol things were going to see a doubling this year in the number of people who are coming across uh a boat or at least of the human ...\nThis is where you see the biggest difference between myself and my opponent so much so that we had to put together a website fact check Garcia dot com fact check Garcia dot com [noise] um I think that we should have border security I think border security as national security we put together the borders strike force we have twenty four seven\nLaw enforcement in the state of Arizona\nOr the the methamphetamine the fat and all the heroin that these brave men and women in law enforcement have interjected as something to be celebrated\nI'm On the side of law enforcement David Garcia would defund the border strike force he would remove the national guard he would abolish ice and he would tear down any wall or physical barrier on the border there is a real difference between myself and David Garcia\nWell he couldn't actually tear the wall down if it was building may be a it'd be federal ... as well as\nA a border of governor you provide input and your partner with with the federal government David Garcia in his own words said imagine no wall in southern\nSaid imagine no wall in southern Arizona that's his vision for border security minus quite different I Want to focus in stopping the bad guys the drug cartels the human trafficking the child sex trafficking that's the reality of being the governor of being the chief executive of state\nOf being in charge of public safety it's a responsibility I take seriously and I've embraced it look working in partnership with the department of public safety our borders sheriffs and law enforcement on the border\nYou know you cannot talk about an election and this year or in this era without mentioning as another man his name as Donald Trump um do you agree with President Trump that we need a wall per se do we need a wall\n... we already have a wall two thirds of our border\nHas a wall right now one third is wide open and unprotected often the illegal activity that you see is is is in the open and unprotected part so so ... where where where needed yes we should have a a wall or a Secretary John Kelly now General John Kelly says\nA physical barrier so I Believe in that I Believe in surveillance and like I said this is to focus on drug cartels\nAnd human trafficking if you look at what we've done at the ports of entry because our relationship right now Arizona's relationship with Mexico\nHas never been better and that's our number one trading partner times for we've reduced wait times at the ports from eight hours to one hour while increasing security so we're letting the good guys the trucking the transit the trading in the tourism\nFlow much more freely for our for our friends and neighbors that love to go down to rocky point and enjoy long weekends down there but we want to keep us safe environment here and our law enforcement is working with law enforcement in Sonora governor governor cloudy up have love which the first female governor in the history of senora\nAs someone who is spend my partner not only an economic development but putting pure leader with pure leader whether it's tourism or a department of transportation or public safety\nWe're talking with Governor do do see this morning on Arizona's morning news or when you're on with a Mac and get us I've tried to warn you about that but you come on with them all the time uh last Monday and you said you are you don't always agree with President Trump what you've always been able to express your opinions in a in a respectful manner\nOr we're going to ask Martha McSally who's on with us at seven forty this morning and it's an action packed are going to a ... if the president's coming to campaign for and if he does will you be there\nOh I'll be there I'll be there when when the president comes to town I'm there to greet him it's it's one of the special privileges as governor and you know on my second day in office I Want to to greet president ... who was visiting sky harbor airport President Trump spent here several times I think Arizona is a President Trump's\nFavorite state to come visit I think he's been here more during the election I don't know if it's been a as much post\nOr an election but of course if the president comes here to the governor is going to greet them ... well that makes sense I I just wondered if you go to the rally well well it's the political season not now is the time for\nFor rallies and if the president comes to to do a rally I'll I'll be their mouth and I are going to be campaigning together\nQuite quite a bit and uh so so we will be at rallies or around the state and if the president comes it will be there as well\nWe've got to worry about the the ... do they want to disrupt things right I mean well it was bad last summer\nI always think at the at large political events you're always going to have some people that are there and and disruptive but you know we believe in the freedom of speech the right to assemble and petition your government I think it's one of the great things about being an American\nDo you have any inside info on whether or not the president's coming out of the governor\nHe's he's been looking at dates to come there's so much going on in Washington DC you know of course he's managing their country and the federal government and the right now we've got some natural disasters but I Know that he wants to be here and there is some tentative dates on hold as soon as they are confirmed its its public knowledge and national news it just that nothing's been up\nA solidified yet\nWhat is the one issue or that you you wish people would ask you more about I I like what what did I not ask you about this morning that you think the story needs to be told about Doug do see and and what you've\nWell this is part of why you have a campaign as you want to really get your message out and we've been talking about securing Arizona's future\nI think it's important to people remember where we were just four years ago I mean our budget was broken our education system was mired in lawsuits and our economy was flat today the budgets ballots those lawsuits are years behind us our economy is booming so much so that we can give teachers a twenty percent pay increase\nThis vicious happened I mean Iran at an agenda that I wanted to kick start our economy restore K. twelve education and the reputation of our state was important to us we've got a momentum in the state of Arizona\nI Want to secure that future I Hope people want to see the same because I Do think my opponent has a much different agenda would much like to make Arizona or a carbon copy of California that idea of of doubling income taxes rolling back public safety and increasing regular\nIllusions that that's that's not a winning direction that sort of winning plan or a governor to do she thinks that for more information Jim people can go to Doug juicy that\nYou're going to get to see that I'm like what are you being a

had eleven senators in our history as a state where young state and will the so the first time and uh like I I've spoken to barriers already in my life that maybe don't focus a lot on that at the time you know you're just trying to you know fly fighters back when I broke that barrier you know to be the first woman to flying combat\nUh there are many women who are qualified before me and I just was given the right up\nIt time with the right to Britain qualification so that's how I kind of this to\nUs and we'll fix becoming a ... ... for the first time or at least the polls we've been looking around Europe um are you are trailing congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema but the but that was by a small enough amount that it was within the margin of error or should we believe is falling and the president was getting crushed and every poll and then he under the boiling very\nWell the only poll that matters is when people turn in their ballots are so but I think uh they ... the trends show an indication look you know we had to go through a primary and my opponent did not uh she's been up on TVs and April with millions of dollars on ads\nAnd uh you know we came out of that just a little over a month ago and uh we've been in the margin of error pretty much since then and the the the energy and enthusiasm is on our side\nOr we're seeing that every single day on the campaign trail uh we're seeing it with our volunteers we're seeing it across the state really a so we gotta fight this thing out I mean there's a lot of money pouring into my opponent 'cause they know if there's any chance\nTo flip evident ability already last quarter yeah\nI mean she's she's going up on TV for like a million dollars every five days are trying to drown out our message um and uh you know present herself in a way that doesn't fully present to the voters her entire life in our past and what she has given her\nOr energy and her leadership too and so it's important for people to be able to see what the facts are as we go down this final stretch people are voting as we speak\nYeah they are are you are on with ... a few days ago by the way the governor was through what I Want them you you should listen to me are American did all sorts of Stratfor career really are but you basically said that you you really have no choice but to come out with negative ads for the general election because here's some sort of had such a head start in a running this general election ads\nAnd the way of uniformed protesting us any pink to tutor someone although I I really don't\nThink the ... is a who was on last Monday appreciated your strategy it's\nUnfortunate that Martha has chosen to run a campaign that's based on lies and distortions and frankly dirty smears\nBecause we've seen so many negative ads are you flip to the polls are leading now a resume they're working\nWell look um I didn't put ... to to uh you know she's the one who decided to go out and protest our troops\nShe decided to lead a protest where she had flyers depicting us as skeletons the troops the skeletons calling us the terrorists you know protesting right after nine eleven saying we shouldn't use military action against terrorists she has years of being a radical left active if she doesn't want the voters to know that\nAnd so a lot of money can portray picture of her being right of center which is where Arizona is\nBut actually that's just not where she comes from and what she's given her life too and so it is important for the voters to know that if she wasn't going to present herself fully like they needed to see what those facts are\nShe's yeah it's interesting if you hear that defense she's yet to explain why she was protesting our troops and why she was calling us the terrorists and why she was advocating for Johns instead of victims of child sex trafficking\nLike she can answer those questions because those are her words and her actions and the voters need to take a hard look\nI in contrast spent twenty six years in uniform I deployed six times in the middle east and Afghanistan three hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tent ward hog defending our freedoms and our values and now I'm deploying to D.C in the house to continue to fight for those in all deployed in the Senate to do the saying there's a big difference\nBecause ... you know you won't go to go you know crossed that negative ad line is what I'm looking at us and by the way I Need to point out this had nothing to do with your campaign you didn't authorize is your campaign to not just with this uh defend Arizona\nWhich is an independent expenditure group or is it like the cold and dark money because it makes it sound really evil right um you know shows this uh through the whole room shows a Phoenix blowing up under a mushroom cloud is this too far due to serve all this kind of advertising ... well\nI have nothing to do with that is right now and we're not even allowed to talk to them um so I mean ...\nAll of them on the radio in the right the more important\nThing is that people need to look at the ... the radical dangerous record of chairs in cinema in the past I think these are legitimate\nQuestions to ask her to defend her record on uh wanting to shut down Luke air force base on flip flopping on the Iran on the Iran deal which gave you know a billion dollars of\nResources into the largest state sponsor of terror that's responsible for instability in the middle east and and the death of some of our troops like this is real or you know positions that she's taken in the past and so I think instead of asking me about something that I have no responsibility of producing why don't people ask her about her record on these issues that she's trying to cover\nOut it doesn't it make it I mean my wife ruled arise and uh she's you know she's she's made her mind up and they'll just say you know yeah [noise] she's a she tends to lead right I'll just say that but she said well this is a little over the top um so you know it's a long\nYou haven't crossed yeah no I'm not gonna wish people would like hey you know I Know you're trying to help me out here but\nAgain in general um I I Wish we would stick to the facts and stick to uh the\nStick to the different records and the and the the different backgrounds that we have in in your options\nUh and in particular I mean again if you look at what's coming out of her side um you know calling me morally bankrupt seriously I mean I raised my right hand and put my life on the line for her freedom\nTo be out there protesting um but we respect our veterans in Arizona so why don't we talk about the issues why don't we talk about your votes or let's have a civil conversation why don't we set the example\nUh that's what we've been trying to do a through this whole process and I really hope the voters will will see through all that\nKGAN our news expected\nMinutes of commercials nonstop news trafficking whether ...\nI'm

Michael the third most powerful hurricane on record to hit the U.S mainland card to have their destruction for roughly two hundred miles\nFrom the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before at the tops of Spain sustained winds dropped to a tropical storm strength National Hurricane center says Michael did not lose its hurricane status until early Thursday when it's when finally dropped below Seventy four miles an hour\nYeah you're obviously when you're looking at some of the um images from the area along the panhandle Panama City Mexico City sounds obviously in Mexico city obviously Panama City Florida um\nThat are obviously the hundred and fifty five mile an hour wins um ripped through these communities and and turned homes businesses and schools into a stack of to fix\nThis hurricane was an absolute monster and the damage substance wake is do you have to be fully understood\nThe damage this morning as we have Fox now almost twenty laugh is never ending [noise] people's belongings votes on top of laws and rules that are friends into kind of all ... and it goes inland it doesn't just stop right at the coast\nSo yeah I mean you had daybreak but the storm hit yesterday around noon Arizona time so a lot of that damage that was being creative people we're seeing firsthand like they were witnessing it out there in Dallas or at least have people's maybe they had those windows bogged down exactly and so now\nIt's where do you go how do you begin what's left of your belongings that potentially have been destroyed through either a hurricane or I'm also hearing several tornadoes slant on that somebody gets hurt\nAnd we don't think about the ... hurricanes can spawn tornadoes in that area\nAnd as we're seeing this widespread catastrophic damage it's not just the damage to stuff so it's people\nWe have thirty five hundred for the national guard with more than one thousand high water vehicles Thirteen helicopters and sixteen boats for humanitarian assistance security operations and search and rescue\nSearch and rescue and I know you look at that that destruction of that damage there's to people stuck in\nAnd I I Want to say it's tough to find silver lining new things like this the death toll is I Would say remarkably low that\nScent of their graduates and how would you say the words I searched tech I'm probably mispronouncing it with a Boston accent yeah I I don't know how to learn how to and if you say\nIt with a Boston accent it doesn't matter if you mispronounce what luck and why don't you try it then Boston is is that what\nI Do know that we're going to go to Iraq\nNot for nothing right eighty eighty six percent of their graduates go on to college which is an incredible number in and of itself but when you also consider the type of education the students are getting here it's pretty incredible\nAlong with typical high school classes [noise] twenty two vocational in technical areas of study or consolidated into a single campus [noise] including some you won't find anywhere else like the tough set ... veterinary clinic\nAt tech veterinarian clinic\nThey actually partner up with Tufts University and they offered this clinic to people within the community as well so what the the educators are saying is not only are they learning a skill but they're also learning how to be good active citizens by providing these services to their neighbors\nInteresting because this is something that you know I I I when I think of this there is a there was a guy out there the champions is his name is Mike Rowe uh I I I Know Mike is the voice from the TV show Deadliest Catch the dirtiest jobs\nRight already is John and he's he's been championing something called Mike Rowe works good at micro works\nI'm Talking about the idea that everybody is it tells you said for every one a college education is it necessary to be a successful human or an American and that learning a skill learning a trade vocational ... there's there's pride in that but there there is there was something good in learning\nA trade that lasts forever so\nThe trades that they have their you know you heard about the vet clinic there there are also training to be plumbers and welders some students learning to work as as tell her that the credit union they have they're\nCalling airy arts things along those lines the governor of Massachusetts though saying that you know there are a lot of kids doing co opt out of our vote tech school where they are making about twenty dollars an hour and professions where that skill capability can translate into Seventy eighty Ninety a hundred a hundred and twenty thousand dollars a year if you stick with it I don't\nThink I went to a unique or special high school down in Tucson Santa Rita public high schools right there by Davis lumping air force base\nA lot of things are talking about in here we're we're part of my high school education this was back in the Nineteen hundreds I'll grant you that but we had auto shop we're metal shop we had woodworking we had ... where we did baking and things like that I don't have an accent\nI'm an bums in my sophomore year in high school and it fundamentally changed my life was it like the pop open that can\nDo so it was not really begun to hold back was used\nYou had to put my was making like a box of brownies I mean\nWe go to ... flour and sugar and you mix it and you roll it out and then you\nGet the ... ... the good stuff in the middle so anyway it sounds like over time I haven't been back to my high school I doubt there is an auto shop classroom anymore we got rid of all this stuff\nBecause they cost money they just never got rid of it will not only did they not get rid of it Bruce they've invested over five hundred million\nIn New funding at the state level so well we here in Arizona keeps slashing and cutting and diverting dollars away from my outlook education system\nAnd we see what's happening to us we're we're in the ... the bottom five you said ten I'd say bottom buying nice Massachusetts is number one they're not taking more dollars out of the public education system they're putting it in and look how that paying off again best practices\nIt makes sense\nAnd all you gotta have the dollar I'm a I'm a I'm a not for everyone it's just nuts\nAnd telling people that if you don't have a college degree or a failure sets a lot of
