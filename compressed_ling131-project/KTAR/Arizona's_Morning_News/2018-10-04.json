that were interviewed there are people that weren't interviewed and and are left out of it so ... ... again I thought the whole thing was a sham from the beginning I thought the confirmation hearing I

make sure to drive it is a\nMust see in the sea hot off the presses alone copy of the newly released FBI report on judge Kavanaugh suit ability for the Supreme Court of the United states now sitting in a single room where senator or being invited one by one to read some of that report for a limited amount of time\nWhen it does not being read by senators or a limited amount of staffers it will be kept in the Senate Judiciary committee said so far no indication that week the public will get to see any of that proposal\nI imagined that Steve has Mitch McConnell's birth certificate and and your passport um\nBeat me reporters out the FBI report 'em and a predictably you have people on both sides of the aisle or cheering or demonizing it by the way reading from a script that they'd already wrote before the report was released\nIn a series of early morning tweets the White House announcing the FBI's investigation is now complete setting off the clock on judge Kavanaugh's confirmation the White House calling it the most comprehensive review of a Supreme Court nominee in history\nAdding with this additional information the White House is fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm judge Kavanaugh on to the Supreme Court\nLet's talk about the word comprehensive um yes I Know that this now makes background check number seven for judge Kavanaugh but let me also point out that every background check picked up for the last one left off\nThey didn't all go back to the beginning so if it if nothing was discovered in that very first one that was conducted I Want to say some twenty five years ago\nThat every subsequent investigation there after didn't digging deeper and this one the seventh is no different the big question for me right now Bruce as the politicians on both sides of the aisle are coming out and either supporting or demonizing this report\nI think the big issue is not necessarily what in the report that's important I I'm not trying to the gate that but\nWhat parameters where the FBI given as to what they could and could not investigate because\nI I Would I Would make the argument right up front ... let me start by saying I think that's an important question don't get me wrong full stop that's the losing argument [noise]\nI don't know if it's necessarily a losing argument this isn't about you're arguing process not I'm not I'm not arguing to be right and I'm not arguing about winners or losers I'm arguing about what is right\nWho don't like what's in the report or or or disagree with the report saying there is no corroborating evidence and that's what we're hearing from senators a fleet can call in saying there's nothing in it a Corker there's nothing in the argument will be the process was screwed up here and I say I get off\nGo to the bank and get hard cold cash in number you can see it I get it sure and I understand that uh-huh we have the tendency\nOverall I don't care if you're an Amazon worker or a teacher or a

pay that fourteen grand need to go there and we got ...\nTo choose a different company this was the thing and and\nYou know this there was a bit of a back and forth because companies out there are trying to send people to work for them we know it's a tight job market and so they're offering some of these pennies you've heard about this before I have a lot of friends at work like in a uh the tech world or a in California for example\nAnd they have all these interesting ... that I hear and I'm like okay what I Choose the Emmys yeah\nWe'll give you an example I have a friend that works for

you see what I'm saying but but if you are focused solely on the bottom line dollar will companies are going to figure out a way and I'm not accusing Amazon to being the various but you know they looked at this and say hey that's all you guys care about the Fifteen an hour you got it by the way we're taking the subway\nRight exactly and so and we're finding out is eliminating lovely bonuses and stock ... after this Fifteen dollars minimum wage increase\nThey take away free coffee here we're going to ... okay right now there and took away our surface caught they took away Styrofoam cup

are a radio station here in the valley that actually have\nBeer they've got you know the the whole we're we're they've got will tap uh-huh they've got cold brew call you know I agree with you and your heart but I mean so you're looking at these benefits and I think what's also interesting as you talk about\nYou know unlimited vacation with some of these tech companies\nMillennials have also talked about freedom and their time being a value so having that flex scheduled to be able to work ... hours they want or what days they want is a value to them so you may be taking home less in a paycheck but that flexibility ... worth ... work\nIf you want Fifteen dollars an hour at all costs in somebody's going\nTo have to pay for that yeah you're going to pay for it one way or another\nIt's by
