look at\nYou know we were talking about this topic at the upshot because we came across some survey data from the early to thousands where people were asked okay here's a list of identities which one is most important to you and you know the options are your gender your race your religion the political party that you ... with\nA part of the country that you grow up and and um you know we were sort of surprised by how Americans have answered this question in the past\nA religion ranked some really really highly for a lot of people that's one of the most prominent things\nUh you know sort of ... people's family affiliations whether you identify as a mother or father or life ranks really highly\nAnd politics were like all the way down at the bottom of this list and we sort of suspected that perhaps we would see something different if we ask people this question again today because it feels like a moment when everyone is thinking about politics when politics there's like a pro bathing everything around us\nSo we we surveyed this question without two thousand people and found once again that politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of ask them this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nIt's interesting because as you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the piece most Americans don't live and breathe politics the way Washington news beans\nIt's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school and I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that\nIt's a bit harder to go to four day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at ours has you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that in the day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's non profits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals\nAre to those nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during the school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts that use for day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's all you know let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to get away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um parents\nStart out not liking it but the end up liking it\nAnd so now I guess the biggest question the twenty thousand dollar question what kind of an impact does this have on learning do we know yet\nYou know and I've looked at study after study and from what I could see academics just based on these studies academics are not suffering under the four day and there's actually school districts that say\nThey've notice higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school more that's how that's how they feel um but academics we haven't really seen studies that show that ...\nWell that's how that's how they sell 'em but academics we haven't really seen studies that show that kids too horrible it just seems to be like you know academics really just don't seem

Indians were there and they were um inconvenienced by it and actually had to migrate out of the area down to the area around ...\n... inconvenienced would be a an a nice way to put that can you imagine wake you up you don't have a truck you probably don't have enough horses for everyone in the village well at that\nTime they probably didn't have any horses so it was a matter of simply walking a down do they went down slope for about seven thousand feet to about fifty five hundred feet ... and it's only a handful of miles away\n... man well we uh thankfully didn't have a we live in a time where we can\nJumping a trucking and have a few possessions and be a little bit more ... what I'm so from the volcanic fields up in northern Arizona down to the Tucson at the University of Arizona What what's your day spent ah ... what's your day can system now\nWell at the survey we do a lot of basic mapping geologic mapping of um seven and a half minute quandary angles so half of our team our research team is actually\nThat's what they spend a lot of their time doing we also spend a lot of time investigating natural hazards in Arizona that includes art fishers a landslide\nPost wildfire debris flows and things of that sort we just published a uh the magic map on line that shows location of all for six thousand landslide deposits in Arizona\nAnd was that all recently those six thousand landslides that just to hear that and what the hungry question\nNo in fact I'm a lot of this was done using Google Earth technology using aerial photography and so we haven't explored or investigate it on the ground each one of these so the timing of when they occurred is on certain but the deposit is still fresh enough that we can identify\nOn each one of these so the timing of when they occur is uncertain but the deposit is still fresh enough that we can identify it so we're probably looking at most of these deposits having um having been formed sometime in the past million to two million years\n[laughter]\nOkay so it's safe to say we're All right for now [laughter]\nWell they're landslides occurring a with a a great deal of frequency we actually see his websites every single year debris flows every single year or what we're trying to do a courses to understand where they're going to happen next we need to know where they've happened in the past and that was the purpose of this mapping\nAnd you said you've posted that on line how does somebody\n... yeah when I fire easy okay it's actually pretty easy it's at our home home site which are a C. G. S. dot Arizona a are icy or in a di di di you\nIf you go there simply go to the center for natural hazard and it will have a we have a series of eight hazard themes there and you can select back or has a theme of landslides\nAnd now you've got a great picture of the landslide that happened on the road up to page was that about two years right\nUh that was gonna say that was twenty Thirteen all my clothes that road for two years\nAnd all the traffic got routed on a temporary road that uh was was cut through the Indian reservation\nYeah that's exactly right um and I forget the name of that route and they they they groomed it it was up there originally and they ... then they pay that it was an extraordinarily expensive venture that they say that is\nFixing the landslide in fixing the road so that hopefully it won't happen again I think it ran over fifty million dollars\nTo get to a very small populated town but yeah that yeah that is exactly\nRight but the folks from page actually may you know they noted that um they lost a lot of income during the period of time on that road without because people weren't getting there\nAlong the tourists and the houseboat industry on Lake

greatly appreciate that\nAnd where that can become critical when you're talking about out in the ag department is there's a lot of homes built over old agricultural yeah [laughter] ah properties and yeah then\nYeah there is and um [noise]\nYou know since two thousand and six or ... as a as a relative or or a landowner a house fire you had to report if you ever sit around your property so that they're reporting is improved greatly but you're absolutely right there are some homes that are\nUh you know with pictures on their property some homes that are being sort of under ... so it it's it's a problem where we've gone from agriculture and we're rapidly urbanized and getting area where fishers occur\nWe're going to have to deal with those visuals in some fashion\nAnd looking at it you know some of these pictures that are showing a figure I'd be like oh it's just you know water washed out whatever how do you look at a washed out area and say hey that's just a it's a little run off or this is something that needs to be reported\nA year or less eyes are clashing ...\nI'm Sorry you broke up a little bit ... is there a size\nIt's yeah it's it that's a really good question and it can be very difficult I think especially in the ... being faced\nTell whether this is a nurse fish or just a a crack as the grounds of drying out um if you're really if you're concerned the best thing you can do is probably give us a call\nAt the Arizona Geological Survey we'll look to see where your property is that we'll look to see if there's any earth fishers around the area and if we think we need to come out they would come out and take a look at it\nSo and again the contact information for the Arizona Geological Survey\nWell you can reach 'em you can reach us at ... area code five two oh\nNine seven one three six eight eight\nAnd when you look at the ... ah the website ... G. S. dot Arizona dot edu and the center for natural hazard ... we get so\nHigh for lack of better we're lazy in Arizona because you don't have tornadoes we don't have hurricanes we don't have the massive flooding but\nUh I and we don't have the earthquakes that equate to a lot of damage but we have all those things happening subtly to the earthquake page on y'all resource center this time lapse video of Nineteen yeah excuse me and I mean fifty to two thousand eleven\nAnd it's amazing yeah we what's happening at Arizona\nAnd we get earthquakes here and we get probably Seventy five to a hundred quakes within the boundaries of the state of Arizona annually most are not felt how many years uh about uh about Seventy five to a hundred and Italy within the rats within the borders that doesn't include what happens in Utah\nCalifornia or Mexico or Colorado that we feel here that's just those events that originate with in Arizona but we get a you know across Arizona someplace there's going to be felt earthquake or two every year\nAnd so we certainly have the capability of magnitude sixes magnitude seven earthquakes here in Arizona and they can do a lot of damage\nAnd the location of the earthquakes does that have anything to do with where we see fishers occur\nNo the Fisher is really aren't related to um earthquake events whatsoever the Fisher is all in\nThese these valleys Yvonne consolidate the sediments where we've been farming for the last eighty or a hundred years\nThe the fault that cause earthquakes I'm a ... a number of them are in northern Arizona but we have
