again that's that's why everybody wants to come here so it's his fault that we have\nThis problem with illegal immigration but he did say yesterday that a ... on Twitter or it was on social media but it really a lot of people were like well ways he serious is he talking about actually sending the military to the border and talking about closing our southern border\nWell maybe not because the

riding that tell I mean riding that gravity terrain\nWe heard a lot of our ... anecdotal I remember there was a documentary about lottery winners\nI'm much there'll be a Netflix or Amazon and you can watch it but it was about the ...\nHow difficult life became for people who won lotteries the things like you didn't think about the things you didn't know how your wife would change the better but also\nCareful what you wish for type ... wasn't called like the curse of the water I literally think of something like that and I apologize that are more than any but I remember watching it going I'm not saying I don't want to win but there is some lessons to learn from people that have yeah\nI think that when you have a lot of money and especially in situations where you win the lottery and you overnight have a lot of money it\nIt really exacerbates who you are as a person if you have very good person then I think that it just really highlights that but if you're a bad person or if you struggle with certain things it makes it that much more difficult for you\nMoney isn't going to fundamentally change your personality no you are who you are but when you're ... you're going to keep saving spender you're going to be spending ... you just move the common\nBut it's one of those things where if you don't have a lot of\nMoney then money is unfamiliar to you\nAnd how to deal with it would be unfamiliar and and again maybe some of the trappings\nOr do you have to go from something being unfamiliar to making its ... year and a lot of times people don't\nYeah although I think it's fair to say you and you know what researchers took a look at lottery winners and if I told you if I said people who win big lottery jackpots\nTend to blow all their money in just a few years I think a lot of us believe that yeah and again that curse of the the lottery a documentary kind of made some of these um uh\nPeople I I remember what you know there was a Kentucky Manny one Twenty one million dollars um five years later he and he actually owed a couple of million like he had he not only blowing through his winnings he ended up owing money 'cause he was borrowing on it and things like that like that actually\nIs not the norm most lottery winners are relatively intelligent by the way they spend it and I think some of it has been the education that comes along with that\nYeah the education of talking to you know I I play like a financial planner and having an attorney right away I help you with this so that the idea that everybody blows it and an end up\nLosing it was more dire back to where they are actually a false and the national endowment for financial education once claimed that Seventy percent of people who suddenly receiving\nLives windfall of cash or not or something along that figure seven figure as long as you sit with on New Year's okay well they they came out just this year and set the record straight and said that statistic\nWasn't really backed up by any of our research so while it's widely disseminated it's not necessarily true yeah the other thing that a lot of times and you know what I honestly think that some of this is just you\nKnow you don't want other people to have you don't have so like if you have if you have a lot of money you're going to be poor and three days or three years\nHave you got a lot of money and you went up through the law I bet you your life is miserable jealousy incident and we haven't found them cause you to\nYour numbers didn't hit what makes you feel better because you're not the one who actually\nWon so you'll hear a lot of times that the money makes people miserable later in life yeah\nI'm not really about finding out is most people who win the lottery cut down on work they don't quit they cut down
