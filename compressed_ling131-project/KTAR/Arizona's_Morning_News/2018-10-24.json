of the ah CNN anchors actually broadcasting from their phones standing on the streets in New York outside of the time Warner center which of course is where the CNN studios are located in New York\nI'm In the NYPD investigating these devices that have been sent to a lot of different places including a beer CNN New York\nUh but the Clintons and the Obamas a receivers of receiving these packages\nAnd they're they're thinking we don't know nothing's been confirmed yet but there is some speculation out there that this might be tied to this explosive device that was a this possible explosive devices founder George Soros is home yesterday you know George Soros of course is the\nIs that the liberal uh donate or a billion Arabs ... donated tons of money to uh Democrats through the years\nUm and of course former President Obama and former President Clinton of course are both Democrats\nI'm ... and you know it was a lot of people that are out there all CNN's just on the side of the Democrats and so you would make sense than that if somebody was targeting you know Soros in Obama and and the Clintons uh they go after CNN too but ... but CNN is also reporting that\nAre officials told them that the the White House intercepted a suspicious package there which would be the secret service of course are the Capitol police or the ... the uniformed a secret service police

you know I think for most of us you know you you don't even imagine the mail room right you just think ah you know but there's people actually sort packages and that's where this was found\nA discovered in the mail room at the CNN I'm Still not clear if this is related to those other packages all the ... just about everything you're hearing at this point other than the fact that CNN\nHas been cleared out the time Warner center in New York and uh that uh they are at least searching\nTo try and figure out what this was that was sent to the Clintons and the Obamas and possibly George Soros related to this is well you know beyond that it's all just speculation we don't know\nUm you know and I think a lot of people also think that if it's a pipe bomb it's a situation where it's like okay what what kind of damage is not going to do right you know it's not like at some big giant thing is like a car bomb or a a truck bomb but you don't want 'em you can use an explosive device to send out a chemical weapon\nA a a dirty bomb which we learned about after nine eleven that's how a dirty bomb works it's it's not it's not an atom bomb or a a hydrogen bomb and what it does is it that it uses a conventional explosive\nTo send out a ready radiological waste and so it can still be a very dangerous situation even if it is a small controlled explosion so I Will continue to follow the

suspicious packages one sent to the Clintons at their home in New York the other to the Obamas home in D.C now neither made it to their residence\nAlso studios CNN of evacuated after a suspicious package was discovered in their written mail room\nAnd now we're learning the Miami offices of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz have been evacuated because they do receive a similar package and let's not forget democratic political activists George Soros received a pipe bomb in his mailbox Monday [noise]\nYeah uh uh I think it's fair to say coordinated I mean that's a there's there's no way they are all a book by accident I guess you you would say or a coincidence coincidence no not like that that somebody or or person could be multiple people\nAre targeted ... all of these individuals and new and the news organization and you know I I throw this out there as well um there could still be more of these devices in the mail but just haven't been delivered yeah\nCorrect the pipe bomb that was put in the mailbox of political activists George Soros was believed to be hand delivered that somebody put it there the post office right and do so you also now have these two packages that were intercepted by the secret service again they were sent\nTo the homes of both the Clintons and the Obamas they never got there the secret service has a protocol right all of that mail is delivered to an off site place they go through it we have\n... yeah policies to go through and you're going to stick around because we're going to be talking to a former Secret Service agent coming up here and just a few moments who's going to walk us through that process but that process work they found these devices and how they've been described so far this morning Bruce\nHit the as rudimentary but functional so these were bones okay and they are being described some of them as pipe\nBomb yeah I've I've heard that most people have seen them with their own eyes describe ... pipe bombs\nAt CNN this morning though this is what it sounded like when they discovered the package in their mail room take a listen\nThis is what it sounded like when they discovered the package in their mail room take a listen\nIf you are saying that they were rudimentary but functional that means they were explosive devices at a projectile [noise]\nAttempting to kind of distract from other things you know it's interesting to me that in the in the highly volatile\nPolitical world we find ourselves where you know there's there there's increasing violence\nYou know across the spectrum of politics that this would be very focused\nUh against one you know against the Democratic party leadership um it's interesting to me though that um you know if you're a bomb maker you fully understand that if that bomb was taken intact it is the evidence that will convict\nYou okay so I'm going to bomb makers\nNarrow the place finish please understand\nNow I say so that is interesting and it raises some questions in my line as to cause all these are being taken um you know and and plus the the postal system most bomb makers are very smart they're very analytical they're very ... uh tended to detail so you're going through a system that\nThat's that's very difficult to to transmit through without you know being exposed I'm your devices are being exposed it it's just very curious to me um and both the one thing\nI Know about ... I worked on an FBI joint terrorism task force it's multi agency I'm effort and they're going to but I guarantee you they're going to be identifying who um the people that are responsible for this\nOkay so to me said something that was really interesting to me we're talking again to ten Nell our president of Lyon heart international services group and former Secret Service agent\nYou said that typically bomb makers are are very smart it doesn't appear to me to be too smart to send the through the mail to\nThe residents of former presidents without understanding that they're never going to make that a ... show by by the fact that they never got there would you say that like this was a little bit of a different kind of message or what are you decipher from all of that\n... you know I mean that's the twenty four million dollar question right there you know why are they doing this or if you think back to the Austin bombing I'm\nFairly recently that bomber was very smart he was very destructive he was very intentional ultimately how to plant even take his own life at the end of the day that's not what we're seeing here we're we're we're seeing a large scale effort coming in waged by the way I Would stress that\nWe're only seeing this particular way that could be that there are more destructive waves coming but what doesn't make sense to me is what you just described if you're going to\nDo the effort if you're going to send bombs or why would you send it to probably\nThe most protected places that you could and then also uh obviously you don't have a tremendous we're being caught because everything you're doing is uh is going to enable an investigator and an investigation to probably identify some key piece is they're they're\nProbably on it now already a running down the trail because when you think of multiple events in multiple evidence change or it's going to be interesting to see how this falls out\nNo attempt thank you very much for your time today and ... and best of luck with your a\nTrading company how to how to find these types of things in San Diego today that's Tim Miller former Secret Service\nAnd Bruce like we were talking at the top of the show here that the packages were found outside of the San Diego union Tribune building in downtown San Diego that is actually in the area where Miller is that we're also learning that right now that senator Kamala Harris yeah has an office in that same building oh\nOkay good good all again could all be\nAnd if you know anything about her studied anything about bomb making an bombers each bomb is like a fingerprint way a bomb or build\nUp a lot about the bomber parenthetically try to figure out who the person is no more exactly alike and that's exactly what law enforcement dealing with right now\nSalmonella outbreak here in Arizona could've been prevented and how do we let people know about the dangerous food will talk about that next\nDoor to moral morning with the latest breaking news last trafficking whether every six minutes on the valleys only only was morning show Arizona's morning News Tomorrow morning by Bill Nye Arizona's new was the night before we live on the news\nYeah I don't just talk about\nTA argue Ninety two three FFA streaming live on the T.
