and we have a light rain we pushes the salts back into our plan so we have to get extra heavy but where\nWould you get two inches of rain it tends to wash assaults all the way down the river now\nWhere did they go you know there's a reason why our groundwater so salty these salts wash off the desert and go down in the awkward for and so some place down there when we pumped water back out

All right and I just wanted to know how to trim them I don't want to kill them but I Want them a lot smaller than what they are now\nTypically Elaine what we would do with roses this time of year is dead headed and cutting back by about a third\nBut if you want to bring them back more than that that would be fine with the weather that we're having now which is you know usual but ideal rose whether you know if you look at like Portland, Oregon where they grow beautiful roses all summer that's about the weather we're having right now so I Would cut\nRight now so I wouldn't cutting back by about fifty percent reduced their size way back go ahead I shot a fertilizer and I think you'll have beautiful blooms by Thanksgiving\nOh perfect\nSo I think it's a great time I mean there was this kind of unusual in normally hear a lot more a lot hotter we wouldn't take them down that much smaller but I think with the weather pattern that we're having with no forecast really over the eighties it would be fine to do a little more heavy printing and we would normally would\nOkay okay\nOkay perfect oh can I Do the same thing I have one climber okay can I Do the same thing\nYou could do that with your climate I'll just keep in mind your climber is not going to grow as fast this time of year is it would normally with the warmer weather but you know reduce the size of your climber now it'd be fined and I think that with the weather pattern we're having you know you could do some significant pretty this time of year and you'll probably have blooms all winter\nOkay perfect well thank you lay and have a nice weekend\nThank you greatly ... by by by\nThat leaves us with a couple of more open minded folks are your price it call the number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven we\nCould talk about anything you want to grow water plant fertilizer kill Joe and tip the good Morning Joe\nAre you doing sir I just had a quick question so I have three dogs or if in my backyard is obviously getting punished from than going to the bathroom what is the quickest easiest way to get my long back\nI happened yesterday called rain\nThat's it yeah well I think that you normally we'd never count rain\nBut as far as leach and everything out and cure and everything up I mean you know this that last rain yesterday with two inches of rain in most places I was going to do a lot of good if you want to make it even better you might even adds some chips them down right now to the whole war on to it or you got to keep permitted grasp of the winter time or did you plant rye or what would you do\nQuite frankly my objective is Los alone it's or off off\nThe grass if you want it to be happier for the winter time this would be like the last time you could fertilizer by we still have enough warmth for it to grow much\nAnd I work I was just some regular Twenty one seven fourteen lawn fertilizer because that's made with like some ammonium nitrate which works well and cool weather and this'll be the last time you feed it for the year Joe\nAwesome thank you very much richer thank you Bye bye\nLet's see next miss Helen in Mesa but after how long we have open lines folks the number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven good morning Helen\nOh\nVirginia wave he's waving at its prices waving at is in the back part of the studio it's got to find so put held back on hold\nAnd um you don't really I Would can't talk too much about how this wonderful this rain was but it really does do a tremendous amount for us you know leaks out of our soul to different things so we just don't uh recently I've ever have happened and it's the supply of water we get going into a reservoir it's you know\nWe're so fortunate here in ... Arizona to have one of the best managed water systems in the world\nAnd you know we learned a lot from our native ancestors that we're here you know a thousand years ago when they started digging these canals and managing the irrigation that came out of the the river flows in the mountains here because we are to desert but how to utilize our water here it's absolutely everything\nAnd um you know with the management we have you know we get these rains and we don't let the water go you know it goes into awkward for that goes into our canals that goes into our reservoirs and hopefully we can build up or you know more normal pattern will will keep the storms like we had last Sunday\nComing from the north but the management of our irrigation systems here\nYou know by first off the original pioneer well first off the Native Americans then copied by the pioneer farmers and then followed up on by us our pie and the other farmers here\nWe have one of the best managed water system to the world but how we use it the fact that we got a little extra right now and how we maintain it use it and say but really help our existence here as time's gone but\nIt's such a blessing to get rain like we've had this month so far are we next up we've got ... and based after how long we have a couple of open line spoke to them recall six so to to seven seven five eight to seven good morning Alan\nMinding my ... how are you [noise]\nHow 'bout you oh good but we have a beep or okay you got the beeper\nWell it's my microwave [laughter] sorry [laughter]\nI just moved here not too long ago from Minnesota\nAnd I'm only I'm totally knowledgeable about black soil planting fertilizing but here I don't know nothing about\nFertilizing the cat just says and I have some um ... I Need to I Want to plant in this ... press [laughter] so um and I\nI Would like some information on how to transplant like what would I put in the hole\nFor the cactus says a shoe says not I'm not I'm not exactly shoes\nAnd the poor cutting the hell are you really do want to uh now is not a great guy you want to really better do them in the spring march April May will be okay take calculus cutting and really really we don't have\nTo admit the soil for the Brady Bunch as long as the perks and range or whatever it is\nBut um [noise] what you'd want to do is just a powder sulfur powder sulfur dry off you know the kind of our our sober\nAnd then in general it's always a good idea to throw a cup full of gypsum and the bottom of the whole here to help the drainage\n... ... ... ... that's really gonna help and that should do it all don't you know yes how are you know they don't you know I don't\nKnow I'm just helping or hurting Bye bye [laughter] okay thank you sell it let's see uh Jose Peoria good morning Jose\nGood morning how are you good sir\nSo I have two questions really I got one that is I might Tangerine Tree ... and I'm seeing a lot of curly leaves a lot of the growth it's there it's curling up and I don't know why and it's like giving me very much\nFruit well how did it in March\nYeah that's really common with a tangerines more so than any variety Jose and that curling is caused by a little insect called threat\nAnd when the new growth comes out the thrift gets on it and feeds on the lease scars the tissue so that when the least comes out bigger it's curled and honestly if you look at Tangerine Tree is of out in the valley you'll see almost all of them have some of that curling on the leaf\nAnd I welcome overly concerned it's not going to be anything you're going to change or do anything about this time of year at all\nIf it persists next summer you might want to try and spray the trip but normally what happens is the threats are eaten by a little native insect care called the ... it's a little green dragon fly you might see around in the summertime that night and they laid on the tree and their larvae eat the thrift which is the bad guys\nSo normally in a home situation you wouldn't be too concerned but I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of curly leaves on almost any Tangerine Tree\nAnd it's okay it's not healthy and if it's a young free planted this year you're don't expect you know boxes of fruit off of a young tree\nYeah it was a a twenty four twenty four inch box\nHas yeah that's a pretty good century but having some currently foliage on tangerines has very calm\nOkay good so then next thing is I have several mangoes uh-huh and um the mango seem to um you know there's a deep green color and then there's the the lighter almost a a like a like a light green\nWe'll never yellow in it okay that in the mangoes has that that's mainly on the new growth Jose\nNot no not on the new growth I thought the same thing because I Know that they come out either red or yellow right um but um but this seems to be at the whole treat it looks healthy but it just doesn't have that deep green color\nSo probably a lot of new growth yeah proudly it's a little more fertilizer Jose and it's kind of late right now with the weather cooling off the mangoes aren't going to grow much like they did you know with all those little cooler I mean a little warmer but um what I Would use fertilizer pretty heavy in the spring\nAnd uh I Would do something that was balance like a good balance citrus food and if you look for one that has elated iron manganese magnesium and seeing kind of a balance a centrist food like organic ... would be a good variety for your mangoes OK okay and to be a little careful we haven't had any freezes for two years\nBut you know normally mangoes are pretty frost tender here and um you know there's a pie is around town now with big papaya is on them but\nWith our normal weather patterns where she looks like we're kind of rolling into a little more with this rain and the you know the storms coming from the north just the ... you have to cover those guys if it freezes this winter\nOK yeah everything made it through the through the winter or the country and came in in in a march mhm but my avocados they they ... I lost those in the summertime when it hit a hundred and Seventeen\nYeah the avocado as do many of us could do pretty well here as long as they don't give froze\nYou know and they're going to be mangoes ever growing in the desert there were there for like Twenty years ago ... over there for Twenty years over by thermal and then about six or seven years ago we had one free to kill them all and that was a big block that had been there for Twenty years and\nAnd actually because of the weather the climate the season was a little different for those mangoes and they did pretty well with them commercially but um you know what goes through you just have to watch the wintertime more than the summer\nCat it thank thank you Bye bye bye Let's\nSee next step Judea Gilbert but after Judy we've got\nYeah two or three open line folks number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven good morning Judy\n[noise] hello Hi I have a a Meyer lemon tree that looks love of life gets blossoms in spring bought I hadn't ... how long have you had the tree Judy\nAh probably about five years and you'd never get any limits I in the beginning I got one or two okay the last couple of years I haven't had any lemon and set off\nThe tree and pretty full sun yeah\nI like I say it looks great it's very fall I turn them off you know 'cause it gets out of out of you know so I I trim at all but um I don't know what\nThe issue last couple of things I could think of that a number one is you know your Gilbert and where where are you located across streets\nOh ray and Cooper\nRank Cooper okay so you have really heavy clay soil so it shouldn't be water any more often than once every two to three weeks this time of year\nAnd ...\nAnd probably once a week at the most in the summertime maybe once every two weeks because it's been there a few years\nUm so you want to let it get real drive between watering and when you're pretty met outside you know the ... proof they've they've actually flower on the new would with they set most their fruit on the second year would\nSo the new growth that we have like when we we we grow citrus commercially\nWhen we go through and we had our big Lisbon lemons 'em to reduce the size of the tree when we do that we'd get flushes of new growth\nAnd we get flowers on those new growth came out the current year\nBut that very seldom does the fruit every last on that so most of fruits going to be produced on your Meyer lemon on the two year old would not the brand new would so if you keep sharing the outside of the tree back tight um you're going to preclude those fruit from setting even though a blooms pretty well\nSo dry it out more okay and if you could avoid pruning it and if you want to this permanent maybe to send it a little better just turn off some of the major longer shoots and and let that two year old would be on your tree I think you're gonna get a lot more for\nOh okay okay well thanks much for the advice\nYou're good luck to you or do you have a nice weekend thank you Bye bye bye archery say Phoenix good morning Theresa\nHello Hi\n[noise] Hi I'm a lemon tree um that I've lived here a couple of years so this trees I don't know I'm sure it's probably at least ten years old and I had some really nice lemons last year that did or strange winter\nTime it bloomed a little I think in December and then it bloomed again\nYou know when that ... you know in the springtime because we had that little bit I have in the wintertime right and so I have um smaller lemons there are still mostly grain and some of them are clients like four or five together\nSo that one the oddest thing but the other thing is one branch one large branch died a couple of months ago and now I have another one in the middle of the tree that totally died lemons and all it's all brown\nSo I'm Wondering\nWhat is going on with my poor lemon tree well Theresa\nLook at those branches and see if we're they're dying there bleeding sap out of the branch are not\nOK okay\nThere there's um there's a couple of things that could be that you have some ... which is really it's a soil fungus that uh is caused by five to offer\nThat goes up through citrus and you'll have branches it'll die out on the tree and so you weren't approving those big branches if they're dead all the way back out um there's also a couple other diseases that they have done in humor with some fungus in in citrus that we're really not seeing that our farms and hide her and I haven't seen here in the valley\nUm that are killing some branches out in a similar fashion\nBut for the most part what you really want to do number one is make sure your tree is getting dry between irrigation\nSo so yeah it is yeah watered about every two weeks\nYeah yeah I was actually watering that less and yet until I called you a couple of months ago it was it ... it was getting less\nWell water can shock out some big branches to because of the drought I mean if they don't get enough water but usually that won't kill just one or two branches the whole three will start to decline normally so I don't\nSee any kind of a south or anything where it's connected to the other branches\nAnd let me put you on hold because they have to take a break\nI'm sure you're not going to get more information if you hold on for one second I'm\nGonna take a break we'll be right

on a cloudy day so\nMaybe something a little more rain we you know we always could use it what the heck can't have it up and looks like it's raining up a little bit north anyway happy Sunday morning we got wide open not quite wide open we got three open lines number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven we have Bryce you're with is on phones and music so given the call\nAnd we could talk about anything you want a robot to styles lots of things to do and the funny thing about gardening is like cooking there's not really a right and wrong we have to experiment we have to try things you know there's all different kinds of soils and fertilizers and different ideas on what to grow and\nYou know some things that have become obvious failures but there's a lot of things that we can grow here in the valley and you know growing up here in central Phoenix in the nursery business I learned from our customers mainly in like the gals on what to call his little lady gardeners of central Phoenix\nBecause they spent so much time you know girlie different kinds of plants and you can certainly learn a lot from a from books in the Internet and different things but there's nothing like cooking there's nothing like trial and error and who knows you might grow something different here that nobody's ever grown before\nNow I Do want to caution you can't just go out and go on vacation to the Caribbean and bring home seeds and cutting and those kinda things there are ways to legally bringing cutting to different things from just about anywhere in the world but you have to work with us da for that\nAnd if you want to bring something different from out of state Arizona you know please consult the Arizona department of agriculture because there are tests that we do not want to hear their diseases we do not want an Arizona and we have a very nice climate here for growing many things and you know we have less insects was no pressure from different kinds of\nDiseases in many places do because of our climate but if our climate change that for ... months who knows that could be a little different too but no realistically with our desert climate here\nWe're fortunate we don't have the insects I mean if you were going anywhere else in the country almost it seems like the mosquitoes and bugs and critters really bother you but because we have our dry desert climate you know we are somewhat more pets free but that doesn't mean that you could bring plants are different places and expect their pesticide diseases can certainly be transmitted and\nYou know growing up here it's a place where we didn't have the sweet potato white flight back in the seventies\nOr to have it just decimate our cotton field to be good in the eighties so if you want to bring plants are different places you know do it correctly check with ears in an apartment agriculture or check with the USDA make sure you're bringing been certified\nYou know if you want to grow plants and throughout the world you know certainly the USDA's interested in all kinds of agriculture and all kinds of crops but there is a right\nRight where do you have to do it and if you follow up with them they can certainly give your direction on how to bring an important plants so we've got four line still open the number to call a six so to to seven seven five eight to seven\nAnd we're here at a climate where who knows what this winter's going to bring no freezes the last two years and a more rain than we've had no long long time so that's always welcome and give us a call with your idea of what you want to grow six so to to seven seven five eight to seven here\nWhat becomes kind of our desert spring you know October and that goes to a real growing season for the vegetables and green things through may\nI'm Michael America puts up next good morning Michael\nYou get bored and you know and maybe well then you're kind of bacteria and\nWelcome back to what soldiers regarding\nSugar Sunday Seventy nine AM and twenty three Katie our we have a price on the phone and use it give him a call a couple of lines open the number to call six so to to seven seven five eight two seven oh let's see next up we've got David Phoenix more to have\nGood morning or their [noise] hey\nI'm I was walking to a growing nursery out in in Mesa and they had some culture wars of films that were very\nTall and narrow and the tag on him said dynasty mhm but I was unclear if they were calling narrow because that's the way they were courting them or if that dynasty really does have that more vertical gross habit\nWell dynasty in Boston you know both those are more vertical and we don't see him use much cheer in the desert um they're really popular like in Tennessee and northern Florida in Georgia\nI'm but typically you know what what we grow here mostly we grow almost exclusively Drake Iams and then we grow that culture bars because it has more of a script reading habit but now you could find a boss Gilmore dynasty on that's going to be more vertical and it's not going to have the pendulum is are we being branches\nNow the Drake who doesn't we put as much as like a true Reno I'm does but the truth has a problem here in the summertime where it really defoliants and August\nOkay yeah this this class looking for a replacement for Cyprus\nAnd I'm I'm you know watch some some something up in the air over the wall really quickly and those look like they would fit the bill but you know what I Would like him for that would be a um\nAn Amish I'm\nA rate would ask you if you want something that's going to be tall or a little more comical okay\nAnd they will stay tight you know rate would ask grows up it's not near as big as a sham or majestic beauty or any of ... but it grows up kind of comical form\nAnd um [noise] would do that you know it was fun it was I was just down to Florida they have a tree called the mastery M A S T and when you look at those they they look like an Italian Cyprus but we've been growing that tree here now for three years and I don't think it shows any promise at all for the desert but [laughter] but it looks like the flight risk drawing in Florida\nBut no I I Would look for a rate would ask probably I think would be the nicest tree that what you could count on to be comical upright and it's not going to be a huge tree it's not going to grow up you know ... yeah but it does make a really nice comical form and it stays tight uniform\nOkay you know is that gonna be deciduous\nIt is but you know what's fun about the rate would actually it's probably the only consistently read even if we don't ever freeze a color tree here in the fall so it'll go till January but it'll almost you know every year turn red\nCool okay one other quick question for you um I've got a class with a really\nBig recessed area like they've they've got a base but then you walk out of the base but and they've got a a thirty by twenty researched area down there and I was thinking about it\nI was thinking about ... it was with a big plant are bad and I was thinking about trying to ... down there because the only light it would get would be the leaves would get the you know catch the light but the trunk wouldn't get burnt and I can control the climate a little bit better so\nWhat do you get a chance for that better than most I mean I think that would be a better place for now because of the most\nIt will fill in pretty solid and might cut some of their white down they want their but an avocado and that kind of a location could do real well you know another fun idea for something like that is a celebrity theater used to have star pines growing and they're like the little ones we sell this house plants or nor for oh yeah yeah the ... and those will do really well set down in something like that as well\nBut I'm looking for the how the growing up the ...\nWell that sounds like you've got about as good a chance there Dave is anywhere I mean I should be for us free you know it should have a little more humidity it should be protected from the intent sunlight so I'd go for it\n[laughter] okay great thanks Brent thanks day by by a famine Scott's do good morning Tim\n[noise] we're in a uh I live at the end all and fourth street and uh it's about a thirty year old a complex and ah I don't have a green come and get a couple of questions okay first\nOf all a we had a a grapefruit tree that the winds last year blue blue\nBroken in ... is there is something I should for or just\nThe way I was ... yeah I mean I Would just butchered balance it with a chain saw him you know a grapefruit tree should come back out in a rebalance itself out\nOkay great and then uh I have some little ... branches on my free tree I have it ... and also a a ... orange\nMhm and they had this very or Tim or wherever where the dead branches located\nYeah they're they're coming out the from the interior and also from the edge\nYou know if you want to take it out the inside of those older citrus and just open up the inside of the canopy as long as you're not exposing the wood to the sun that'd be great and you know ... ... especially with orange isn't tangerines you'll have a lot of dead wood on the inside\nOkay and just pointing that out and opening up the tree makes it easier to harvest fruit you don't have those all dead sticky branches catching the arm so I think it would be great\nIf you were mentioning sat before what what what uh\nWell what do I look for in fact well you'll see sat bleeding out of the side of the trunk and and if you really had a problem with gumbo so she would probably notice it but go most is caused by ... which is a soil fungus and it's fairly common here in the valley and you'll see like ... coming out of the size of the limbs but if you don't see that it's nothing to worry about\nIt and then you also mentioned something about the cutting down cutting cutting a a a a a ... a knife or something along the the uh the ...\nWell the only the only reason for gurgling Katrina whenever I grew up with ... and the guys from washed her citrus and my grandfather and a bird is what they could do if you're having a naval orange okay and you're pushing a lot of the fruit off or you're not getting as much that what\nThey would do as a process called gurgling and they would cut like a quarter inch wide slit halfway around the trunk like on a naval ... what's that does it reduces the outflow and get a better a set on naval oranges for fruit you know it's not something that's commonly done any more\nAnd uh you know it's done with grapes and different things as well but gurgling is a process that we we really don't use much anymore\nOkay hey I got another question on long mhm at that just a dry hole dryness okay and and ah I was wondering do you do you ... or\n... area and it's probably not going to cure the problem if you have dead patches if especially showed up like in August and lawns I look for one or two problems um one would be it might have some Pearl skill in there and so to find Pearl scale you take a shovel and just dig down about six inches deep on the edge of where the patches are\nAnd see if you have like a little orange Bebe and that that's a Pearl Scott's little insect it feeds on it and the other that causes patches like that can be soil fungus now if you're going to plant right grass neither one of them is really a problem you'd probably just want to deal with it next spring\nBut you know those would be but ... there's always a good thing to do\nAnd if you're going to plant right grass typically when it's done this before you know before you're Bermuda grass comes out so if you would kill your right grass early shut the water off in April

I. L. A. D.

Holt markets crash it's ugly the people in in power get blamed the gear teams come out and it's just not a good time for everybody so they constantly are giving us the stance that have no real basis in reality\nAnd you kind of say well but you know if that's what kind of keeps this whole thing going you know why do I care\nWell the reason that you should care is\nBecause it allows people if they believe the numbers and not just allows them actually kind of direct them to making bad decisions\nSo for example last friday we had the jobless numbers come out and people talked about how well you know yeah we didn't create as many jobs as we expected but when you look at the raw provisions for the month before it was still okay and now we have the lowest unemployment rate we've had in this country for fifty years\nBack to Nineteen sixty nine or whatever it was\nWell the thing is that true okay and we're going to get into why it's not true but what it means is is that when people hear that and they think holy cow the economy is firing on all cylinders therefore I'm going to put more money at risk and the stock market\nThey're buying in it the wrong time the key to making money at anything in life is buying low and selling hot\nBuying stocks at the all time high of the market is unlikely to yield the returns that people are expecting and this is the thing stocks are incredibly expensive right now it doesn't matter what metric you want to look at stocks are basically they'd been may be more expensive once or twice in all of us history\nSo you say well why would I buy them now\nWill people buy them now because they have this misperception that the economy is doing well and everyone you hear okay tells you it's doing well it it doesn't matter even on the left they'll tell you what it's doing well but it's not dividing the\nThe results of the economy fairly or we could even do better or whatever it is but people don't argue with the fundamental fact that well but the economy is growing unemployment's down\nBut again those things are incredibly misleading statistics and the leads people to do the wrong thing to get into the market after the big moves have happened to the upside and again if you look at where stocks are priced right now\nHistory suggests that the stock market's going to return after inflation something less than one percent a year for the next eight to ten years and in fact you could be looking at negative rates during that time of return\nAnd people say well that can't possibly happen\nBut it can happen and it has happened in it likely will happen again in the future if you even look at the period between two thousand and two thousand and sixteen for sixteen years actually going on Seventeen years the stock market return less than a half a percent a year once you factor inflation\nAnd that's when things you know we're getting up to all time highs what were higher all time highest now but the markets still up less than four percent a year not even factoring in inflation\nYou sit there and say okay you have all this debt out there what's going to keep this thing growing your people stop borrowing money and they start paying back the money they do well in fact nothing\nBecause the only reason there's been anything that looks like growth pretty much anywhere is the fact that people are borrowing huge sums of money I mean the United states last year for and actually for the last couple of decades\nFor us to be able to grow the economy a dollar we have to borrow about three dollars so again as long as there is confidence and people are willing to borrow and people are willing to lend we can continue to get something that kind of looks like gross\nBut besides the feds issues which I'm going to get into it swam so concerned about the election this fall again not a political statement you can think Trump is the devil and you can think he's got on earth it makes no difference to me okay I Do not have a dog in that fight\nBut if the Democrats take the house and I don't know that they will or will not and again don't have a dog in the fight one way or another\nI'm going to tell you that is not going to be good for market confidence\nBecause if you think the last couple of weeks with Brett Kavanaugh were kind of vicious waiting to see what happens when when ... when Donald Trump is center stage okay\nBecause I I don't know I Would guess that if you went back thirty six years in ... Trump's you might find something slightly unsavory um that or at least that you could ... truth that way\nAnd and again you may think that all that stuff should come out and you may think it should all be forgotten in the past and you may have blind faith that he's telling the truth and blind faith that no matter what he does he's a liar\nAgain it makes no difference\nIs it going to be good for the country's confidence confidence in our economy the confidence in our markets\nIf it is two years of sheer division well every piece of this man's life has investigated and not just his life\nEvery person who knows Brett Kavanaugh's probably not out of the woods yet and again you may think this is all great and what should happen in this divine justice that's all fine but I understand is going to have a tremendous impact on business and to be Frank they find the party out of power\nI'm not sure I'm Upset by that because of you crash this economy you will romp in the next election you will take every lover of power that's out there now again I Am not attributing that as a motive to anybody do not misunderstand\nBut they've had worst things happen to them and you know don't throw me into that briar patch as it were so I look at this and say what is it the kind of road confidence one of them is money getting more expensive\nToo is obviously the markets starting to go down housing has been slowing and many of the larger cities I was actually we had a student and the other days but a mortgage broker for going on Thirty years\nAnd his statements flat flat out was the recession is already started he said I've been through this movie before he says there's two big brokers\nKinda nationally that he mentioned don't remember the names offhand\nBut both of them I was laid off you know around two hundred people like one of them last friday laid off a hundred and eighty people the other one was like two hundred and fifty and you said these are the things that you see happening when housing is basically grinding to a halt\nNow can they do things can they go to less money down can they keep this thing go and maybe for a little while sure but at some point we know this all has to stop\nAnd when it stops it's going to be really really ugly and again if I'm the party out of power or even the party in power and I'm not in love with the policies that this president\nIt'd be really nice to be able to blame all this stuff on him when it went south\nAnd and as I've often said\nWe give way too much credit to presidents for things when they look like they're going well we give way too much blame when things aren't going well because at the end that day the president can only do so much\nNow but it doesn't matter it's all the perception and so if we can hang a whole bunch of stuff on you know where the other the other party is in power then that's going to be good for us\nSo when I look at this I see a couple of different scenarios I mean most people believe that the Republicans will hold the Senate again maybe they will maybe they won't I have no real insight into this but actually read some analysis today that kind of was here's the four scenarios of what could happen\nAnd one of the scenarios was Democrats take the house don't take the Senate\nAnd it was well you know Trump just stopped ... a lot of his way and you know whatever and we kinda muddle through oh no no no no I don't think that's one of the choices again I think it's two years of investigation I think it is two years of division\nThe likes of which we haven't seen and again people can blame either side that's not the point\nBut are you prepared for that financially are you prepared for that if all of a sudden there's a recession how safe is your job okay we always think about well this is what I'm doing the market goes down and and I had a guy in the last class at a fair amount of money and you know what's your strategy when the market goes down because none of it's protected right now\nAnd the strategy was well also\nWell the question is at what point how much are you willing to lose before your cell\nAnd then to who because everyone's trying to ... to sell right so we need to have a better strategy from the for them that\nSo again in the class what I'm trying to teach you guys is\nHere's how you can be prepared here's the science to look for that the markets in trouble than it's here's how you're not just survive it how do you actually make money when it goes down and how do you continue to make money if it keeps going up because he didn't do that to have you want to come up to class shouldn't get too free tickets and a free tablet when you come out the number to call is\nEighty four forty eight trader that T.

expensive again on almost any metric I've ever seen\nHistorically just as a second or third most expensive market in history and drew for you to justify those prices you have to believe we are on the verge of some great renaissance and I don't see it\nYou got a third of the country not working and again how do you have three point seven percent unemployment was Ninety five million people aren't even looking for work okay how can that possibly be\nWas because of how we do the stats and the way we do the stats doesn't make any sense as long as someone doesn't look for work they're not unemployed\nOkay so if no one in this country had a job and nobody was looking for work the unemployment rate would be zero it would be Nirvana K except that we would all be broke\nThis is unfortunately again a part of my whole point on if you don't understand the fundamentals of how these numbers are done or even like the inflation numbers inflation numbers are totally insane\nWhen they calculate inflation they assumed that every person United States wants their house okay\nAnd then they assume that they basically they make it up okay well we think this house would rent for this much and that's how much we're going to charge you for it I mean seriously that's how they do this and and it's like forty percent of of the CPI the consumer price index is tied to housing costs as which are totally made up oh and by the way\nAnd when you hear these unemployment numbers of people argue about what was it a hundred and fifty thousand or a hundred and fifty five thousand or two hundred thousand or two hundred and five thousand jobs\n... what are those numbers come from a lot of them are estimates okay one of the things they do is they say well we don't know how many new businesses started this month so we can't contact them to find out how many people they have so let's just say let's say there were ten thousand new businesses is ... this is what we do\nSay we just make up how many businesses we think just started up this month and how many people they employed\nAnd then we'll do that and argue about it in a country of three hundred and twenty million people we argue about whether this five thousand or ten thousand fewer more jobs and this is the insanity that's leading people to make bad decisions in their own portfolios\nAnd making bad decisions in Washington\nThe Federal Reserve has screw this up big time and they've got a difficult job\nBecause they screwed up so bit okay but now what they're doing is not just raising rates if the quantitative tightening that is where the real danger to the market comes in of the kind of known knowns there's among an unknown unknowns out there that could hurt this market\nBut that's the biggest no no and again we're closer to the end of this than the beginning to come back to that thought but for those if you're just joining us\nNew class I'm going to be teaching on this is before the crash profit and protection strategies for any market the idea is that if you think about how does Goldman Sachs how to Warren Buffett how did these people really make money in the market they buy loans so high\nThey don't buy stuff and hold onto it forever they don't buy stuff in hope it goes up they buy stuff and they make it go up so you think about Warren Buffett\nThe first quarter of this year he bought Seventy five million shares of apple now did you buy 'em all at once no he's got the money to do what he has a hundred billion dollars you know what to do with it but didn't buy 'em all in one day why\nBecause Warren Buffett pays attention to price Warren Buffet bought those shares best I can tell for a hundred and fifty to a hundred and fifty five dollars a share\nNow after we bought him he told you that he bought him why did he tell you that\nBecause he knows that you'll look at and go well Warren Buffett's a smart guy if he's buying apple I want to buy apple and he told you and it was about a hundred and sixty five and from there to stock went almost straight up to two hundred and twenty five he's up fifty percent in his apple trade already K\nBecause the retail trade or doesn't pay attention to price they hear apple to hear Warren Buffett and they think good investment\nBut it's a good investment if you get in it the right price so in class what I'm going to show you is how do you identify the places where people like Warren Buffett are buying and selling and if you could do the same thing they were doing at the same prices that's a useful piece of information and then it how do we manage our risk when we're wrong\nSo if you want to come out and get to free tickets to be one of the next dozen callers and ate for for\nEight eight seven twenty three thirty seven\nOr
