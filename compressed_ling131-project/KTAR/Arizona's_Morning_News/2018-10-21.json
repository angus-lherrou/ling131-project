wait till spring\nOkay well I'll just wait till you guys have them when it's closer to spring an outcome and by the plant yup\n... February fifteenth theory that's the time thank you thank you Bye bye Bye bye unless we don't have a freeze again like last year I brought in Mesa good morning run\nMore a yes or\nA a I've got a couple of\nGolden barrels that we've planted a tight spot and they made the move and okay so uh as they come up and move\nOut of here you could just dig 'em up and move them right now are on the best time to move barrels and transplant cactus is when they're going to grow a little bit more of the best times really march April May but if you want to move them right now with golden barrels you're not going to hurt him\nOkay but a a march or April ... better\nIt would be better cause then they're going to route and be actively growing and they're going to transplant better but barrels or you know pretty darn hardy and they're not too hard anyway\nWell\nNow you can get laid off tomorrow go out and enjoy the beautiful day one and a lot of play it safe for any out there\nOkay and I was listening to the wild flower see the you carry any kind of a I got a area that's probably a fifty fifty feet walling you carry a big bag\nWe we all have bigger bags I'm not sure what we have in stock it's been kind of a really crazy busy months so far\nBut I doubt I'll put that on the Brian checklist for the day you a choice of ... and wild flower seats and I'll make sure by the end of the week we're we're pretty heavily stock because I think it's going to be a fantastic here to grow wildflowers\nAnd we don't we do normally carry larger bags now I Will caution you they'll run wild flowers do exceedingly well they're really beautiful but if you plant twenty five hundred square feet of them next year in may you're going to have to take out twenty five hundred square feet of them\nWell and that's okay I don't want to I don't want to do what they were living in anything in the summer I just wanted to look at\nHow they're beautiful and they're really easy to grow so I'll make sure that we have them and all the nurseries by next weekend\nBy very good thank you actually run by by by\nAh let's see if we got Pat Summit after pat we have three open lines that number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven good morning pat\nGood morning thank you for taking my call love your program I think um I have a problem it seems some things hit two of\nMy trees one in the backyard and orange tree and one in the front yard is it ... I'm a line of fire or whatever you want to call it ... comes from the west\nGoing east and one of my son says that he can see a tree further on down the street that got hit he thinks somebody with a drone flew by with a laser\nAs well I'm not going to say what's possible what's not you know there there were there used to be a late night show on the radio that all kinds of things happen but realistically if it's all in the west side of the tree I'll tell you what's probably what really happened is the trees were summed up a little too high in the sun came over and burned the west side of them\nA bug and they were saying that they were maggot ... never heard of maggots being in a tree before\nWell that would be kind of odd you know ... ... ... in decay okay it's a chance for Americans could actually been there's we've had a lot of rain you know and if you have something that was dying and therefore the maggots defeat on that had some protein and it was the king you\nKnow then the maggots would be but actually eating the wood and the trees you know they're ... they like to eat meat [laughter]\nWell that's what I thought so but I doubt\nBut in the trees you know they're ... they like to eat meat\nRight well that's what I thought so but I doubt it mean to orient out\nNot at all and then I guess they're not going to be in the soil and they're never going to have your ...\nWell I was just totally surprised that they found there\nCan be other critters are can be grubs and different things but not maggots\nOkay All right well I appreciate your health insurance you have a nice weekend but I kept I bake a John out in the ... good morning John\nCornyn for him but of course ... above your garbage I'm all for twenty four hour ... ha ha ha one governor reserves now I see a couple of different ... different looks out on one of them\nAre the plane leave and then there's another one that's a kind of Harry Clark is the bottom and her off the ball or label book up for what's what's the difference on those\nYou know there probably is some genetic ... rival difference to those too and you know those can be growing by division or tissue culture either one but a lot of her grandma tissue culture and I would say two labs got two different starts to slightly different plans\nAnd the thing with the ... the hybrid I's and cross breed so much I mean they're like like people you know they they can all breed together a lot of them can anyway\nAnd so they're probably genetically a little different I've noticed differences too cold to bars as well and uh so do you will see some definite you know variation to the different ... and you also see a big difference in the look depending on how they were grown if they were grown into nursery in shade or in Folsom\nWalker okay and then double double flower or basically the same the same way with about ... years for at\nThe plant should should perform pretty much the same I I don't see a big difference but you know what the ... there's because of all the hybridization there's probably two or three hundred you know proper okay to call to bars today and you know if you go back Twenty years ago there was twenty that you'd find\nOut who directs okay thanks Johnny ... happy gardening ah let's see next stuff we've got Nancy in Phoenix after dancing that we have some open lines folks number to call six so to to seven seven five eight to seven prices back your smile and give them a call good morning Nancy\nHey how are ya great\nAwesome [noise] you know your explanation about the Martians shooting the Reagan on a tree with a possibility in my case\nWell wait wait a minute was it was flown by a grim one\nUm I I actually didn't witness the event I just looking at the results here um I had a little uh Cassie a treaty that I planted a\nReal early summer and um it seems like it's a very uh Thursday tree so I you know I all summer long I I wanted to quite a bit and the well you know\nThe well a couple of times the roots weren't real well established yet obviously but I'm a prior to this torrent of rain which I had absolutely no idea what's going to come I did water it and then the rain came and wouldn't stop and\nUm I think after about maybe a week or so ago that nonsense\nUm if the the leaves started\nYou know showing signs of stress and it ... it it got worse and worse of course 'cause the rain was stopped and eventually now it it looks like it it did look like it was dead and I thought well I'm going to have to pull that out now and I was thinking of what I'm going to replace it with but a\nLow and behold I've got little\nSprouts coming out little a branch let's\nComing out of the low down part of the trunk\nNancy this is this a popcorn casts yeah I I'm not sure\nWhat a big compound leaflets about real bright green tree overall has a yellow flower\nIt does have the yellow flower on it and the real feathering kind of leave that almost resemble the bird paradise in a way you know okay I mean it's\nAlmost for them and have a day or lead to try and figure what kind of ... what so so what's your question here about our poor little pass it's going well in March and\nI I was just wondering do you I was just wondering what the whether it was the Martians or whether it was just the roots being wet because I Would\nIf it would probably you know the root stayed to whet our plans they really can suffocate and for some plants that really helps them but typically\nWhen you have a problem with roots stage to what you have fungus has and other issues but what kind of unusual is it your plant is coming back out\nSo I Know it might it might be that it was accustomed to having more water and even the rain didn't do as much water is you'd given it before but\nThere's nothing like success with a thing coming back out so what I Would do with with most Cassius Cassius a lot of them can be for us in there I'm trying to figure out which one you have but if you would send me a photograph to the website we can I tell you more about the variety that you have\nAnd can be for us in our trying to figure out which one you have but if you would send me a photograph to the website we can I tell you more about the variety that you have oh hey up and then I could probably give you a better idea\nAll right yeah I I I thought if it was a a a fungus or a ... problem on the roots certainly wasn't getting any growth out of it\nNo it shouldn't be coming back out so I Know for a photo on the website so we can kind of figure out what it is what type of ... and I can probably give you a better idea\nYeah I'm just waiting to do any shopping on this to find out how far up those little a branch\nOut I I definitely would right now and if it's a popcorn Casio you know we've had we've grown them for years here and they can be frost tender and they have they're kind of we uh we plant basically\nBut they grow weird patterns like that and they will default weight but as long as the trunk and the wood is green on those Cassius they'll rip follow it and come back out and I had that happen plenty of times usually it's summer heat but it could be other stress reasons as well yeah it made it\nThrough the summer I mean it was it was unhappy a few times but a lot of water seemed to bring it back\nThat sound like a ... or send us an email and we'll ... we'll take a look at it I get back with you appreciate could I ask\nYou about when I ask you about ... ... ah will grow that in this area it's a way to\nYeah we went we do grow at somewhat it's not super popular but we've grown it here and uh when it would be something that will happen the nursery probably in the next couple of weeks and we also have it it'd be a little boy in the spring I've got to take a break do have a nice weekend and Kenneth I\nWill be right back after the break with what the owners regard show in the meantime we have a couple of lines open the number to call six so to to seven seven five

roses for Thanksgiving\nYou know and right through the Christmas season through New Years and then print and back in January so you've never planted a Rose Garden before if you never grown a rose Bush\nYou know here in Arizona we're fortunate to be in a place where we grill millions of rose bushes your farmers out in the west valley and now down in Maricopa a supply a big part of the rose bushes the United states and the reason why they're grown here in the desert\nIs because we do have those dry temperatures we don't have the pressure from diseases and insects that they have in other places\nIn our son just burns all those problems to death in the summertime maybe our roses aren't very pretty in the summertime perhaps they don't bloom very well in the summertime but they're healthy and they live okay next up and got Steve Down in a court cycle morning Steve\nOr the morning how are you\nSpent time in East Africa was fascinated by the uh-huh is there any way I could buy that things of that tree and\nUh you know that tree has been grown here before and um let me do a little research for ya and I'd be happy to do so now\nI I personally have never been this busy and my entire life where I spent my entire life here in the nursery business but with the weather we've had this spring and with us coming on a crop of Myra lemons that we have to gather field starting next week it may take a little patience Steve\nBut um I'll I'll do some research for you if you want\nAnd I I could I could probably go on line\nHe can really be about you\nKnow there's a lot there's a lot of different trees that are being grown here and now we're getting away with doing a lot more tropical things here that we have in the past you know one one of my favorites\nNo there's a lot there's a lot of different trees that are being grown here and now we're getting away with doing a lot more tropical things here that we have in the past you know one one of my favorites along those same things

not part of it any way or nothing like a little football for a young man happy Sunday morning folks we do have three lines open the number to call six so to to seven seven\nFive eight to seven and one thing about football I certainly have to take all the coaches I've had they been wonderful measures I met in Phoenix good morning Annette\nMorning how are you know I have a I Am great it's a wonderful day is\nReally really pretty [laughter]\nIt is I'm Out here with a horror show so it's wonderful but I have a question about land Tanner uh-huh\nOn their normally pretty hearty but on this last summer and actually summer before the center of the land tenets the red land Tana is totally bare and I had leads and flowers just on the ...\nYou know and that we we tend to kind of big Norway antenna because they are so easy and sometimes it's the plants get older the insides going to really you know kind of decay and fall down how much the approval and fertilizer\n[noise] I'm not much\nYou know it really probably help it's not going to change anything much this time of year because you know fall's kind of here if you want to look a little better right now you could hit him with a little liquid fertilizer but best thing is probably just butcher them back pretty heavy in the spring\nAnd and that would be spring ... really march\nBurn a back heavy in March and fertilize him one time and they go Oh thank you and that we really love you\nYou know they're ... they're white oriental most but you know animals we have to give attention every day or plant some time you know far less though when land is one of those it can be the last child\nYou know it's like the coyote of the desert\nYou know it just tends to live in a case of what I Would do for the land tan it's just not do too much with them for right now I'm not really think about it much for the wintertime ... back real heavy in March fertilizer right then\nAnd then you can credit back almost to the ground and they'll come back full are in better there are some things that will bother and but if they get just you know watering once every two weeks\nYou can kind of back almost to the ground and they'll come back full are in better there are some things that will bother and but if they get just you know watering once every two weeks in the spring once a week and the summer little fertilizer something to grow on your problem we have and be a lot happier next summer\nOkay um well I Know that question I have a ... ... the trees that are ... years old\nOr yeah then is is doing its thriving but the other one the leaves are the tips are black and gold curled and it's just not happy it hasn't grown very much\nHave you fertilize it at all and that I did okay I think he may have given it too much fertilizer yeah OK might have been a little different than might have been a little too much love and the nice part about is that that can that'll probably leech out and come back okay in the spring the ... are going to lose their leaves in the wintertime go dormant\nSoviet spring comes and they'll all changed when I Would really recommend to you though is maybe one time running hose on it's slow overnight let it run for ten or twelve hours elites the first time I have a way I Would suspect and he'd say much\n[laughter] [noise] how do I keep them from getting a little do\nYou know it's not usually too much of a problem here with our weather I mean it's it's because we're so dry it's usually not much of an issue I I wouldn't be over because they've had it\nA few years in a row they've had pretty severe mildew those leaves fall off that\nWay you can do is you can treat him with the fungi aside\nAnd he was treated with a fungus side you know right before they leave out in the spring probably has a preemptive and then maybe once again later in the spring but ah that would be the way to treat them into fungicides you have to be a little careful with because they're probably the most toxic class of chemicals that we use\nBut you can buy like an all in one fungicides pretty much anywhere that will probably get rid of the mill do for you\nIs that a systemic or it's this this make you can put it on the soil before they leave out and it goes up through the system and should work well for you\nOkay great thanks ... thank you very much so I have fun outside it's a beautiful day in fact\nJai ho thanks yeah it is it's gorgeous thanks site\nAh might get surprised good morning Michael Hi thank you\nFor taking my call a quick question I have higher cats as I have about five of them to create screening and private it from our neighbors and some of them are growing there probably four years old some of the growing nice and green still and a few others and the growth has all been light green\nA little bit more roast is okay and it's caused from typically a lack of iron\nSo I went to feed him with some iron key late okay and that that should clean it right out for you okay very good at what might combined with that Mike as you might give them a little bit of soil sulfur at the same time to make the sale slightly more acidic\nWould probably help as well All right that makes my Bye bye thank you so much by by ah let's see Ben in Phoenix is up next good morning Mr ban\nGood morning how are you this morning great sir hey I have a quick question we had some permanent or down put down or asked her termites a short time back\nA little while back and uh one of the a trip system lines was punctured when they dug the trench\nSo they build it up with the current or let us okay and like this close to but I'm Wondering if that term to get into that drip line because they have a garden right nearby and we haven't been grown anything in there just because we're wondering if determined or go through and if it could just get up in the plant or a lemon tree\nWell your your worry is this your worry is that you would have a you know a little punctured a line and then the the water pressure would be turned off\nAnd wild on him a cool was wet it would be sucked back into the line okay right so if your line was on right at the same time so the only time that that could really happen as right when the chemical was applied why it was wet and the trench okay while the puncture line was open\nAnd and then if while the liquid was into trench you know basically your wind was turned off and on you know the best thing to do is flush your flush your irrigation system so if you just go to wear your tree is\nYou know or heart repair the hole in your line go to wear your tree isn't just taken open up the end of the drip line run some water out on the ground you know let it run for an hour or so we draw the line out and then re attach or but I wouldn't be very concerned with that with that type of a chemical going into wine and he is theoretically could happen\nYou know through the section on the line up the wind was punctured in liquid was there than line was turned off and on but that would for primarily happen just at the time while the chemical was being installed\nOkay okay yeah I ... the the why wasn't running when the chemicals installed so sad and there probably is the holes for a period of time\nOn the whole and itself shouldn't hurt you know and then the any amount of would actually go into a puncture just threw itself running into it would be really miniscule but if you want to be\nHurt you know the the any amount of would actually go into a puncture just threw itself running into it would be really miniscule but if you want to be saved just washed one\nAnd that just a quick with a lemon tree actually a soaked up through the roof is let's let's say some some term goal to get over there into the system [noise] um they came out or the tree is would would have any concern with trees so committed in\nIn ... not normally you wouldn't have a problem you know in the end or systemically there are a lot of chemicals that worked pretty well systemically and there's some that we have to really watch you know economic ... chemicals when we're using around plants but they're used commonly an citrus trees and\nAnd what's conventional citrus um it's a chemical that would be part of a normal process for a lot of farmers you know that would actually go into a lemon that you would buy commercially in the store\nAnd uh when used properly they're very safe that type of a chemical when it goes into the soil once it's dried out forms a pretty good barrier but was your puncture in line like you're describing it but just a hole in the line I wouldn't\nAnd then to prop go ahead and do that again before they start to bloom in the spring so I Would treat them right now and I would treat him again in late January early February and that's going to go into the trees system it's going to make those roots toxic to those big lard with the big worms that are feeding on the roots of should help quite a bit\nOkay aside from that it's really hard to fill those larvae because they're typically uh up to two feet under the ground you know you'll see the tunnels their exit hold on the base of the trees\nAnd but I Want to be proactive I hit him that way right now and then if you want to kind of catch 'em in the summertime when it's their breeding in ... and you'd want to catch him he'll kinda late baseball like I always remembered as the little league seasons things that we used to chase around with our baseball bats on the big beetles\nSo it was a a killer or something like a ... type of a chemical or seven or something like that\nAnd treat them you know just before they're going to exit and that would be late June so uh you know somewhere last June if you were drinking the soil then you'll probably knock out a big percentage and you might really help your trees outlaw okay\nAnd that's a grub control what what was the brand name use\nRegular beer makes it but there's a lot of different brands but the active ingredient as intimate corporate okay and that's the ones you'd want to use but you don't want to use that in the summer blooming cycle on the plant you'd probably do an application now in the application you know early spring before it's going to start to bloom\nAnd then write summertime you'd want to use more of a contact you know type of thing and and put something on to dredge them with in the summertime there's going to kill the adult beetles that are getting ready to exit is the metamorphosis and turn it into beetle stage bell\nGreat this is a big help I really appreciate a dusting sulfur is not the way to\n... it's not going to be talking to you know unless you actually put it on the Beatles themselves are coming out I can see where it's going to help at all and it might not even help then\nYeah gray thanks a lot every day you too Bye bye\nOr Barney up at Apache junction good morning Bonnie\nAnd Clyde mining thank you for being there on I have a fight that place that I see it as a a a\nA natural barrier or wall between a neighbor uh at the on that friendly topped your side then at\nA brick wall you know as far as the screen hot as hell and over the winter I cover that fight that with a man ... caught\nA and hoping that that will take care of and I I heard they may be really watering at at for you think there's got to stay up for us like a week\nBefore I got to get water on the ground I don't know that that that's true they do and the winner\nOf on a couple of things that\nGoing on with this thing is it about Fifteen Years old and uh it it\nBroadcast in each direction from ... class like his heat one way with that threat in the center of the other way to help out five feet riding on one\nA lot of paper and find out what else going on is right in metal that cats have a pet ... and I just went out and look at it out of their skin small lead about\nJust about less than an inch\n... and I just went out and look at it out of their skin small lead about just about less than an inch long and I'm Wondering how the air I should add ... that scandal it out\nWell ... you and what normally happens as we plan to fight as as much like a citrus or any kind of an evergreen tree as the plant gets bigger denser canopy the foliage on the inside is is not basically functional anymore and so the leaves fall off\nAnd you know the outside can if he stays green and the inside becomes you know basically hollow and that's kind of what you're experiencing as far as doing major pruning on bike histories the best time of the year would be after the frost so usually the first of march\nYou want to really butcher them back to the first to march that would be a great time to do it okay as far as covering him protecting in the wintertime the last two winters we haven't had any frost it's certainly not a harm them than mild yeah it's\nBeen very mild and we don't know what this winter's going to bring we did have that little storm that came through a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday were rain that came straight from the north\nUp you know those storms are very advantageous because that's what's brings a snow fall in the mountains you know we get hit that weather pattern is really kind of a good thing\nBut to protect your bike has set frost caught they using is one of the best protections that gives you a three or four degrees protection as far as being wet the plants are wet don't freeze as easily as the ones that are dry\nBut you're going to get more benefit from your water watering kind of simultaneously wow it's freezing because as the water freezes it actually gives off heat\nAnd so that's a big benefit so what you'd want to do with your watering as having water and have your water be running underneath them while it's freezing\nOkay and if you want a real if we're gonna have a really hard cold what you would do is put your Ross cloth over them and then put like some hundred watt light bulbs the old Hassan late last on that sound Weiner's to ask them to give you more protection than anything else you can do\nA K. and I can you talk for a play about fertilizer and ... well\nFertilizing on those fake histories what'd you you could give them a little bit right now it's going to keep them kind of healthy through the winter time wouldn't be a bad idea but the most important time as before they're going to come out and do the really nice flushing the spring so you'd want to catch that right after the frost is well okay and what type of ...\nYou know what a citrus food or work really well for ... a balanced yeah I just can't read and a lot of the citrus foods like the can or procedures that are really well developed for here because they will have some elated iron and so for them and that's going to work well for your bike\nBy one other question I leave that for a lead a lot of them that dropped on the ground protectorate for China the heat in the summer is that a good thing\nWell that's like you know basically what happens with leaves Bonnie as they shed like that that kind of goes through a composting process and as they break down if they get enough moisture overtime they actually replenish the soil\nYou know so there's a lot of different thoughts in philosophies on that but it's like when people mow lawns and leave the grass clippings down around it for his orchards you know we leave all the foliage under our citrus\nBecause it broke down and actually produces food for the plant in the future so it's the healthier thing to do if it doesn't bother you by just being annoying having the piles leaves their\nAs healthy as we asked rates have right let's\nTake an ally of the cats cats at like at that ... out at chicken wire\nWell and the cast feces probably is a benefit to the fight [laughter] you don't mind eating anything or not\nHow much water and uh it can you help me with that at that age or if\nI had a hell Caroline is what I ended up putting ... because I had such a short run on Eric ... that I was blowing up the pressure was too much or something when I kept having broken broken or with a line that draft ah not on the ... the ah yeah the draft\nYou Bonnie what happened was like is is when they're established like yours are they're extremely drought tolerant and you'll probably really don't want you to grow too fast anyway so you you might not need to really fertilize them at all if you do it all maybe just one fertilizing once a year in the spring would be plenty\nAnd as far as watering bike is trees when they're established you could water and probably once every two to three weeks you know in the wintertime or like the spring and fall probably not at all in the winter less it's going to freeze\nAnd then for them to grow their best probably once a week in the summer but tell me how to protect well with watering every two weeks as long as the temperatures you know below hundred degrees okay\nAnd I'm going to wait for how long\nWere you want to get the water down to adapt to three to four feet or host probably four or five hours at a time\nFor how long were you want to get the water down to it up to three to four feet yeah with the dollar has probably four or five hours at a time\nOh what an orange to leak at three ... three to four hours\n... that's in the heat of the summer that's when it's a hundred and Fifteen\nOkay okay and I'm not here so it's on a timer yeah yeah\nSo what I Would just probably wrote them once a week you know from ideally the end of June you know and I sell some time about the middle of September\n... okay and watch a week or you want to get it eat so up on it so Caroline uh\nWhat you really need to do bunnies you run your ... and put a probe push up the guy on the ground see how it is getting you know we had like a a probe is the chief shaped piece of rebar we pushing the ground but I think you can find a long enough to push the ground where do you have a couple of feet deep that's long enough to water okay\nI've never done that but I understand what you're saying thank you\nSo I'm not any evidence we buy buy take a short break well what do you have a couple of lines open the recall six though

where he could be living in a cardboard box pretty much anything in between any of those and you know those of you listening to show for a long time no\nWe don't really talk much politics because you know as I've said off and on the show certainly in the past as\nI've come to the conclusion that we've created a political problem in this country to which there is not a political solution\nAnd we spend all of our time worrying about what's happening in Washington or Phoenix or wherever it may be instead of focusing on living our lives in taking care of the people the institutions that are important to us\nI think that a lot of it just becomes somewhat wasted energy and one of the reasons I think the understanding how the financial world works is\nIt gives you the ability to build an income to build wealth for yourself or your family your church synagogue jump or whatever it may be\nBut you can do that without having to get caught up in all of the the viciousness that has become the system but I Do want to talk a little bit of politics today simply because\nIt how it's going to I think potentially affect the market and could potentially affect the market in a very great way I'm going to take a step back\nTo ... I remember it was an August and I'm thinking it was two thousand and Fifteen but somewhere back in that kind of timeframe\nI did a show and I did a follow up show on talking about how people were losing trust and institutions in this country and how that had very real long term implications and what you found back then was the only two groups in and this was before Ferguson by the way some remember that part of it so whatever that you know few months before that\nSo they re ... there were only two institutions that more than half the people in this country had faith in one of which was the military at Seventy seven percent\nAnd the other was cops at about fifty two percent\nAnd one of the points I made was and again this was pretty Ferguson is you know there was a lot of pressure already be put on kind of people's views of cops and that may not be holding given that it was only fifty two percent back then and that would have very important implications\nAnd the fact that the military certainly deserves in my opinion our respect and and the rest of it in the vast majority of cases on\nLook you know the Pentagon weighs as much money as as anybody does and then this stuff and there's a lot of an accountability and whatever but the people that are out there trying to do the job on the day to day are patriots and they are people that are sacrificing a tremendous amount for the rest of us and I have a lot of respect for people that serve\nBut all that said there are implications to a democracy when the only people that the citizenry has faith in our essentially the police forces which is the military as well as law enforcement\nAnd I made the point that that just becomes a very difficult situation for us to have a guinea functioning democracy and we have to at some level have some faith in our system or our system is going to have to make some radical changes will ...\nWe have to at some level have some faith in our system or our system is going to have to make some radical changes well what we're seeing some of those radical changes coming about if we look at what's happening with Brett Kavanaugh where do you think he's innocent guilty whatever totally beside the point\nAnd you can say well then that means act so that means y understand all that\nBut realize the total lack of rationality that is going on right now in this government and that will have consequences and it will have consequences for the market and as I mentioned\nI have a tremendous fear and again I'm not pro Trump I'm not anti Trump I Want the country to work okay\nBut I have a tremendous fear that if the Democrats take control of the house and people are predicting that I don't know if they're right or wrong\nBut if I were to happen I Do think you're going to look at two years of impeachment hearings and it's going to be two years every bit as brutal and horrible as what we've just been through a whole cabinet thing and people's lives were going to be destroyed rightly or wrongly and it's just it's not\nIn my mind is not going to be conducive to this market continuing to go up and I would be very very cautious and just 'cause I got cut off a little bit in the first segment\nTherefore the classroom and to be teaching is before the crash and the idea of this class is and it's it's one of the most popular ones that I teach\nBut the idea of this is before the market goes down you got to know what you're going to do when before it happens you've got to prepare yourself so you don't take big losses you then have to also understand that you can actually make more money faster on a market going down then you can on the market going up\nBut the average retail trade or will never make money and the downside\nThey essentially are passive and I've given this a lot of thought to about you know people keep coming in and telling me they don't want to be traitors they want to be investors will define investors to me because to me the only difference between investors and traders as traders realized that they can be wrong and and they have to focus on risk management first\nThe investor essentially has one strategy to what they call invest I Would argue it's gamble\nThey put their money at risk and they don't really have a plan for well what if it all goes horribly wrong and again the market's gone up for nine straight years it doesn't really matter what you've done if you've been buying stocks are probably doing not great but doing OK okay\nThe problem is is that when the market turns down can turn down very quickly\nIf you think about what happened in two thousand and eight the market last forty percent of its value in a month\nThe market wants Thirteen Years of games think about this from it Thirteen Years of games in a year and a half\nOkay if you lost Thirteen Years of your kind of performance in the market right now how is that going to prepare you for retirement and especially when you understand that you can make more money faster on the move down then you can on the move up so again in class we're gonna talk about all these ideas\nWe're also going to really get into how the market works\nBecause people you know some people will focus on what's called technical analysis they're using the indicators and whatnot\nFrankly that doesn't really work because the first thing I'd say is look there's hundreds of indicators if this really worked with are like four okay you know you have your ... to ... and your are your ah cc eyes and ... and all the thousands or hundreds of these things right\nSo how do you know which ones you're supposed to use one and within that there are an infinite number of adjustable parameters that you can set of different links and you're only looking at averages\n... there are a ton of problems with technical analysis but it's what most people do because it's kind of the best they've got\nThey won't remember the story exact but there was a classic story of a guy who became an economist but he was a weatherman for the army back in World War two and he was you know given the task of you know we need a weather forecast a month in advance before we do the de de landing 'cause we have to kind of you know be prepared\nAnd so he and the guys all started working on it and they came to the conclusion that it's impossible you cannot predict the weather a month in advance and in fact since then they've kind of figured out that once you're about eight days out your forecast is really not much better than random chance right\nSo they go back to the Pentagon and they say hey look\nYou can't really do this okay there there's no way of knowing what the weather's going to be a month from now and the response they got was we know that but we need it for planning purposes and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because it's\nHunting purposes and that's a lot of this is that people use something because it's the best they think they've got but it's because they don't really understand what's possible ... one of the things really understand about the markets is\nWhat drives the market to supply and demand it's buying and selling if you knew were Goldman Sachs was willing to buy apple and So Apple would that be a useful piece of information\nAnd I would argue with the ball game if you knew that if you knew or Warren Buffett was buying and selling and you just copied what they did\nThat would make this a whole lot easier and so when you come to class I'm going to show you how we do that now we're not always right but we always make sure that when we wrong we keep our risk really small and what it really is is a disciplined approach to what I Would call investing\nAs opposed to buying and hoping which is what most people do so again if you want to come out to a class I'm going to be teaching this one personally when you come out if you if you win tickets you'll get to free tickets
