is nova print and of course you get the idea right away it's something that relief discomfort\nWill build that mess on exciting right off the bat but let's get right down to business millions of Americans both men and women are dealing with issues related to their vein health whether it's unsightly spider ravines swelling in the legs and they just come the comes along with it were a key journal hemorrhage bottom line\nWe've got tens of thousands of miles of beans running through our body and like everything else they endure the wear and tear up the gene and it seems like no one's really talking about this issue much less offering options still manages so what's the problem and what's this breakthrough from Europe\nWell the breakthrough of course is prescription in Europe one over the counter here and of course it's been used for fifty years safely will expand on that as we talk a little bit more about it and what is it well it's a wonderful well tested citrus peel extract it tight stain\nIt hookers them up so that they were will work to push that black we've got red hoses and blue hoses arteries and the thing that we've got to push that the oxygen aided blood where does that pool obviously in the bottom half of our body and it's got to get pushed up through and back to the heart\nAnd if those things are weak and the\nThe blood pools we only have um these problems unsightly Bain spider ... we have a whole issue of circulation we've got to get that circulate station going\nAnd the uh aside from standing on your head that way to do it is new va print HD now we mean high dose that is that does the same does that they use in these wonderful clinical studies that\nThey're laid out all over my desk here so I can remind myself of all the wonderful science that's been done over the years since the Nineteen seventies\nOn a wonderful citrus peel extract that helps your veins get strong so they can do the work of pushing and getting that circulation back to your heart against other that your circulation is optimal and you know this uh the ingredients\nIn this wonderful a new for print HD also helps your blood vessels white it creates it little gas

our brain that are critical little to issues that we need this great circulation so it works in more than one way\nBill I Know this is much more than just a cosmetic issue but there's no doubt spider veins were were those visible veins you see on the legs are definitely a big issue for both genders may be more for women\nI sometimes see ads for those creams that promise to redo smarter veins and they're not cheap so I think you've hit the jackpot with this appeal to directly address the issue especially if it's helping to address the underlying cause\nIt certainly does because what we have here when we see spider veins there there's a lack of circulation in that area on the legs and so it's making new ones to tried to branch out and make sure that this is all happening so\nWe we want them to receipt of course and we live in an era when\nThis should be happening because we become stationary we call it sedentary were sitting at desks or a great deal of the time were not walking and moving our legs and it's actually the muscles in our cats\nThat are actually squeezing on the plane and then there are one way check valves in our veins so the the the blood only goes one direction but new but print eight eight addresses the real root cause of this but the issue is\nIt shouldn't be happening that they should be strong enough to make sure that that blood\nHe addresses the real root cause of this but the issue is\nIt shouldn't be happening that the main should be strong enough to make sure that that blood doesn't cool and it does get pushed back into the heart so that we can get oxygen aided blood so this is an issue of circulation\nPromote good circulation\nAddress the real cause and of course what's interesting is in Europe it's been used for fifty years well documented

the capillaries or the connector is between the red and blue hoses and that's where the\nOxygen is exchange where nutrients get in were waste material comes out and those can actors can get loose and therefore a tent and so on will explain more of that as we go on but certainly this wonderful remedy for purity products new for print\nHD from purity product is the answer to the cause of what is the origin of these spider thing even ham rights 'cause that's the main problem also and certainly we're sitting all day you may have symptoms\nAnd uh certainly this addresses that and the doses used here

problem it's the happiness and your legs and the circulation and the pooling of the blood plasma that causes issues now that the capillaries\nWeak cup your hands together and you can hold water but

help out here\nAnd for hours and hours that blood is going to a pool and the lower half in our legs and so on we're going to get swelling and so on and of course it's just overlooked in Europe it's that prescription we talk about well it's not that costly there here it's over the counter all you need to hear as\nWell what kind of symptoms of I having why should I use this and of course we're
