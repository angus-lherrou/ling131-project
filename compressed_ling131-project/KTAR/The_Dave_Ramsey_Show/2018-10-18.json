when you go out there you feeling that kind of push back are you going to people that are challenging you with you know whether it be this you're writing about Andrew Jackson he's a horrible human being 'cause he was a slave owner are you getting any of that\nYeah sure in fact uh CSPAN tell of our to some books festival the day of\nJohn McCain's funeral this was still packed and I'm In DC and

to American indian\nSo it's not like they want an avid dialogue is\nI'm In Washington DC were eighty five percent of the people did not vote for Donald Trump or George Bush and you just have an agenda

it's called the conversation but yeah people are\nJuan Williams you talked to Geraldo Rivera you talk to die to Brazil did it's called the conversation but yeah people are so angry now they're not conversations\nNo nobody's interest in that conversation and people are looking for their thirty seconds to sound bite of fame that they're going to get on the Internet but the reality is they they don't want to have a conversation because you may come back with something they can't answer so they want no part of that they just want to be able to throw the first punch and then run away and that drives me crazy about today's world\nBecause we're not having conversations Brian I like having a I had a dream or on the other day we did a podcast forty five minutes of dreamer was a great conversation we had a conversation about everything from sports to what he what it's like to feel like an American and have trouble here to his wife and his kids and all of these things\nAnd it was a real conversation we did we differed in a few areas and we agreed in some but we never get to that point any more because we want to do was yell at each other\nI think that to look them I going to defend President Trump's riding a horse face for Stormy Daniels absolutely\nNot I am I going to defend a you know calling people out you know call me Rosie O'Donnell an animal now I Am I you know if there are some things are indefensible that President Trump does I'm not going to but in the big picture I don't look at it get up everyday and thinking how he's destroying the country\nIf you look at these numbers you see the economy increasing you see her defense getting stronger you see our trade\nDeals getting better if you want to argue with me at least think knowledge what's happening and then challenge me and I'm not going to push back when you say does he need to tweet personal attack absolutely not is it beneath the office for me yes\nBut it can I tell you that his approach is

being\nJewish ... matter of time has got to be jailed his CFO is forced to take immunity his best\nFriends office has been raided and now he's got to get immunity one of them anyway who owns the Enquirer think about what he deals with a daily basis they the Trump name is lauded and hated it used to be pretty much respected so why did he do it\nAt least acknowledge he's doing it for the country at least acknowledge that trade deal is that we can build another\nBuilding in Mexico and Canada at least acknowledge that he's trying to get a better deal for America he takes on the ... you not for his ego because he feels as though the trade deals are tilted against us and NATO wasn't paying enough\nHe's not running from allies why can't you take a step back and say he's different\nBut let's see if he's wrong I Want to say let's see if this works\nNow I don't think people understand that because they look at everything is so emotional they and they've decided to let their feelings or you know handle everything in their life and I to me I find that\nCrazy we're talking to Brian humane Andrew Jackson and the miracle of New Orleans and to the out in paperback next week or you know do you think Andrew Jackson would've treated I think I think a lot of these guys would have gone on there and it was just totally been in trouble like ... like Trump\nWell Jackson is a good point when you your regional question I did not do a good job of answering as how are they like they're like this they both were despised by the elite or the predecessor John Quincy Adams bronco bomber they both are not accepted as presidents of the John Quincy Adams left the White House before\nBefore uh before the before Andrew Jackson did even get into the White House causing a deer riot with a lack of security\nSo you as somebody who not like the case of the people Jackson was the first to campaign when Trump was not accepted by the Republican Party or\nA the Washington establishment he brought his case in middle America and guess where he wanted\nMiddle America he was a not worthy of the office they looked at Jackson going so poor that backwards or the Carolinas he used to draw in crude to be president he's from he's that Jefferson Monroe he's now Washington you know he's not Adam this guy's got\nNo sophistication at all you know he's a military general that you know he's good at that but not this meanwhile\nHe is the American success story he is the guy that was offered to Thirteen to volunteer for the revolutionary war that lost his two brothers during that war and his mom and his

the rebels and it\nAbsolutely in last question appreciate your coming on today or you look at this whole thing going on with a cause showy and everything that is happening and the way that Trump is looking at it and you know what\nYou look at this whole thing going on with a cause showy and everything that is happening and the way that Trump is looking at it and you know one of my things on the talk about a year has been talking about throughout the day is the fact that\nYou know Trump looks at this and a much more you know a macro way the whole thing we need Saudi Arabia as much as we don't like that and in some ways I was trying to explain to somebody they you know sometimes when we fight monsters against what we need we need other monsters and that's a weird crude way to say something like that\nBut that's the way that I think Trump is looking at this is it's it's better than than us when it comes to things like Iran\nAnd I don't think people understand that but at the same time what took place is absolutely heinous\nIt it's like this ... is is like a friend of yours who your trusted\nIn Rob's everything from ... second I came to the keys to the house I trusted you left for

five foot two to five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now\nHeather is in the lobby of Ramsey solutions\nFrom Spokane, Washington where the question I Heather\nHi Dan how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashing lives on two babies that far\nThere's not a magic answer the concept or the or the critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement Mm right yeah or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd with most people that means you know three years four years something like that um but if you're if you're a fifty nine it might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nI'm twenty eight on friday\nOkay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two\nBut you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got ... ... you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that\nYou're not you're you're still going to return multi millionaire you know if you do that it it but if you stayed out for Twenty years been called that baby steps ... what I'm that's see that's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so the thirty years' old your your game own on retirement taking on a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will have saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire you say I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is high thanks for stopping by ...\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City how Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay\nI can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school but at the game the residency included\nI I decided to specialize um and uh\nWould you get a fellow or what um\nUh yeah I'm not certain that's what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um while I'm very very very appreciative yeah\nGood yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so how can I tell\n'em yes away when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control of this money 'cause it under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm\nA yeah I was I was given control this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice my father uh who's helping me to manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's actually ... me or I Would like it\nFinancial advice from my father of who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's essentially asking the rain stopped me or I Would like it a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of a money for a living expenses um and I've said that about five thousand dollars from\nSome small side jobs in hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and have set myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWill do thing it would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings I'm In this two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on a three month when duo basis until I needed to take them out that pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvest the rest\nUm well probably would not do that and the only reason is is the tea bills basically or bonds\nAnd a bond interest rates are yields are go the bond values rather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing and the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in T. bills that could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase show that's not a very safe investment an environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross\nIncome type phones but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe because that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing\nAnd Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum or you've defeated your own purpose do short yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go towards something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a responsible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how real\nThat even though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call sure\nI I just wanted to thank you for all you do um this stinks and very Well Mark ... it's been seven years and it's not hard than I have paid off our debt I'm following your plans to go for that\nI'm from I'm calling from today is I'm not for an hour a little concerned about our parents are hoping you could give it some advice on how they could got them um my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of heart pound area\nAnd I'm so every time there hurricane come through um they they experience so far they can get on their on their property at their home as well as my dad is now\nAnd we were just wondering what you can end as far as they sell it and then um they have now that they do have um some savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nToo often does this property blood\nWell in non and it flooded and it was it got like forty answers and the house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got and my dad shop I think about three feet or so and it almost at length about six inches from getting in the house again\nAnd ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them in any town a farm and is it\nIs throughout this past down we actually pack that or I didn't I was able to help them with adequate but they packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that\nThey're so what are the mouse to his living there has become more painful than not living there\nBut those are the fear of rising water even even at the fear is not founded we once in Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that he's developed a phobia for them and they're not have my own living there and have a son living there why wouldn't they move\nThis is what has developed a phobia of or them\nAnd they're not on living there they're not as fun living there why wouldn't they move\nI don't care I mean the actual threat a flood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be that concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking Everytime the weather person comes off as a training\nIn this town of ... 'cause my phone to live there\nSo you know it's more of an emotional buses but that's an okay decision\nFor all of that was my phone liver more moving\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nUm well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there even me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked with NFL players for Twenty years off and on and um I Know this is a a a world class one half of one percent athlete\nUm but they are twenty two shifts there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter] but I don't mean that their life skills have developed [laughter] at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes\nUm because he still is football skills are are the best on the planet\nI'm and his physical act human his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body and MIT error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nIt but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed a ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids are out they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and\nEven a player that's been in the leagues for years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ... and so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier anything where your spotlight then you get a success level\nAnd your skill is world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else to go yeah yeah and that's true with the you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business\nYeah yeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when an American nosy nosy for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a long and these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now because in probably in three years I Would not be in his late ... uh and the most\nMoney these kids will make will be within their first three to five years of the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I told them like ... you have to get focused but\nWhen we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen you wrote getting you know the ... to ... get into graduate survival guide a book and also taking our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what the old they're professionals do not know mhm if they can get ...

mean it it it is it bad ... like that if ... if I'm if I'm content and but they're definitely room to grow so my question I guess\nI I'm not sure which direction to head because I'm going to spot

being content you know days purchased contentment Rachel cruise almost wrote an entire book on contentment content that does not mean\nThat you're in a bad place I think you're happy you're thankful you're you're grateful you've been able to work hard and get into a new space I think what you're feeling is the pitch to continue to challenge yourself and by the way that it's also a good feeling you can be content meaning I'm grateful for what I have\nBut I'm not happy with who I Am so I'm very concerned I\nI Am honestly living the dream this is the greatest time of my professional life I'm

would\nUse the military he would use American troops to close the border to try and stop the flow of care of and a caravan of migrants from Central America yeah Kenny he closed the border is he allowed to how do you do which\nAnd I couldn't be prouder than I Am of him and my little brother is still serving an active duty today he's in the navy he's the governor's made he's deployed six times in this war six times in this war\nI felt like it was really unfair and sort of fact checkers three fact checker said Martha's claim about ... sauce\nI have never protests our troops because that's my own family and as you guys know how seriously I take the issue of taking care of our veterans you know yes like I like a dog with a bone right to take care of the men and women who served our country so what I thought was unfortunate\nAt an in addition to my hair um was the the false allegation\nWell let me let me talk about your hair too and my wife brought this up to me please be told my wife is very conservative she was appalled that a woman attacked another woman based on their dress their appearance hair you know the two two\nHow did you take that because I was surprised a woman would attack another woman based on looks or based on what they were wearing almost like a dress shaming thing instead of saying here's some cinema voted for this I don't stand for this\nThe ... to to was brought up how did how did you feel about that or did you did you get the same reaction that my wife had a I Can't believe they're done in the dirt with this uh what she's wearing stuff\nWell Martha has chosen Toronto very low road on his campaign\nHer entire campaign has been focused on personal really dirty smears against me and false attacks and that's the road she's chosen\nBut even when I'm not on your show you guys know that I I listen to you know that you've talked about this before and and as you all have noted many times on your show a I don't campaign like that right I don't do that\nWas that a decision you made at the very beginning or is that something that evolved of okay did we fight back to we attack back or know\nWhat I Believe in I Believe that you can have a difference of opinion with someone else\nAnd you can do it politely you can be respectful about it and you can stay focused just like your wife said on the issues in the votes every time we have ever talked we've agreed some of the time and we just great sometime\nBut one thing I'll say I love coming on Mac AND gate us because it can be respectful we're polite to each other and our professional to each other we have a little fun we disagree and we agree that is how our system should be and I am disappointed very disappointed\nThat market has chosen to run a campaign based on ... attacks and we saw that\nYou know most recently in the debate mhm do you dislike mix Sally no I don't and in fact before the Senate race she and I worked together on a lot of issues\nAbout after the ... sit at home and argue fuming from some of the ads that looked like on fear and don't want it\nTogether on a lot of issues\nAbout after the ... sit at home and argue fuming from some of the ads that looked like on fear and don't\nWant to know I'm not you know I mean I understand that this is a political tactic that she's chosen\nI Am disappointed by it because I think it lessens the importance of what we're doing and what we're talking about in this country real Arizona's have real nice right now\nThey're not getting what they need or what they deserve from our government and what she's chosen to do in the campaign doesn't answer any questions or concerns me in line like let's get you some health care let's figure out how to get education\nLet's take care of our veterans and science and focus on the issues laser focused and she's over there\nDoing these increasingly desperate activities\nWe were with a democratic candidate in Arizona Senate race representative pure cinema big topic Arizona's taken and hundreds of asylum seekers are from Guatemala we have another caravan headed towards the United states a lot of people were placed in churches here in the valley where you want to see happen anything be changed because they're doing it legally\nSo one of the first things that should be changed is that those who come to this country seeking asylum should have their cases adjudicated quickly right now our system is so backlogs that when people come to this country and claim asylum\nFor the listeners who may not know what that means it means people who say they're fleeing their home country because there'll be killed right so they they they have to leave because of gang violence are they being tortured or other horrible things\nSo if they're coming here and claiming asylum they have the right under American law to see a judge and have their case to be decided that the backlog is years and years and years so many of these families just kind of weight\nDo you think it would be right for the president to change the status of Honduras Guatemala change the status of refugees it's a lot easier to get to the United states from Central America than it is to say from Yemen or Syria who were refugees have to go through you know halfway around the globe\nDo we need to change the countries that cannot apply for asylum set us do you think or are we going to be dealing with thousands of people each and every week or month in this country from Central America\nWell it's important to note that refugee and asylum are two different things so refugees are people who come to this country legally 'cause they've been invited mark I live in ... as you can't live in your country anymore because of war or genocide and see them come here a ... or people who flee their country and come here and then ask for permission\nSo I think the key is again to get these folks in front of judges very quickly\nSo not stop the amount of people or change the status for them allow them to come just a Judy Kate them much more quickly\nI think it would be difficult to say to an entire country you don't qualify to try to come as a ... because if there is a horrible war going on in another country\nAmerican policy as you can come here and request asylum but we got to decide those cases fat and so the key is to get enough infrastructure into actually decide the cases and send the folks back who don't qualify\nAnd then settle the people who do qualify you guys know that's less than ten percent of people who apply for asylum actually receive it\nBut we've also heard that less than two percent are actually repatriated because they either disappears skipped a court date and they can't keep track of those people either\nBut if you do to ... quickly OK takes care of that problem\nAll right we're with a democratic candidate in Arizona Senate race representative pure cinema do you like President Trump\nI Am happy to work with President Trump on issues we can agree on like veterans I was so proud when we got our bell allowing us to protect whistle blowers and fire the bad guys that VA which you know I've been trying to do for years he signed into law I was so grateful because if you recall President Obama was not supportive of that legislation\nSo I Am grateful that he cares about this issue and I'm Glad to work with him on it\nBut I Do not like some of the policies he's put forth recently like for instance his terrorists the terrorists are really really bad for Arizona businesses and for agriculture\nSo my approach to President Trump is just said you know take it as you see it work with them and stuff you can work on um west and oppose them on the stuff you can't work on I'm with now if it's bad for Sony's got oppose it but you can do that as
