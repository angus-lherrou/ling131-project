you will they're going to tell you are going to get everything in the world\nAnd what they give you is you know your front lawn if you're lucky you maybe get your backyard\nTrump tonight did what

job [noise]\nAnd by the way you're going to be hearing that over and over and over and over and over\nSo there's two big things that this\nMid term it's going to be about one of them is capital the thing with Kavanaugh that really I think woke Republicans up got them fired up got them excited was the fight that the Democrats drew a cabin on the other one is going to be\nImmigration particularly here but I I ... that is what is going to excite Republicans and when you look at what's going on right now which is you've got a a you know a a caravan of people coming here and\nThis plays into the hands of the president and he is going to use that for every possible thing that he can to get people excited and at times tonight listening to it I'm like I Can't tell you know ... this is just as much if not more about him\nThan than it was mixed Sally but he's going to play it up when it comes to what this is going to be about just last week [noise]\nWe achieved another historic victory for

keep them rallied got to keep them read he got to keep pushing it got to keep doing these kinds of things 'cause\nIf you or\nThe president you're looking at what potentially this could mean to you\nIf you lose the house now you're probably not going to lose a Senate in fact I dare I say I think you're going to pick up some seats in the Senate and he's a very good chance there's just too many seats for the Democrats that they had to defend that at some of them and very read parts of the country and they are going to do to defend that many they they they know that\nThey may they may pick up one here but they're going to lose you know high camps already done so you understand that you're probably going to be sitting in a position that as as as what it is and the Senate now if not a little bit better but the house looks like to be a foregone conclusion that you're going to lose it\nThen you got this push and now you're getting excited and the possibility because the cabin on all these things and then you step back and you say to yourself if I lose this thing this is where\nIt all originates you're going to get investigation after investigation after investigation after investigation\nOn me from\nRussia to ... to my taxes to anything else so I better start pushing all the things that we done and if you guys want to change those things back wealth and handed over to them see from us [noise]\nCrying Chuck Schumer [noise]\nThe radical Democrats take control of Congress on November six [noise]\nThey will try to plunge our country and Jordan nightmare of gridlock\nPoverty and chaos you know that got to be a mess\nAnd that's what he's going to continue to do over and over again and if you're Trump this is why I hit him with the economy I go after immigration St both sides failed as you know and we got to get this thing done and why didn't you take care of DACA when\nYou guys had control go after those things\nBut he's going to come out and

I feel like I made one of the worst mistake some a lot of [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return a leash car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nMe take her car back that you owe money on our signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and the other end on a repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car for these companies that you are paying the leash to yes you're being ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the total of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end\nIt should be lash because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off on the line when it doesn't include all the interest from the time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nShow the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what strikes by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to K. Bebe dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sales what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up and the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars and the whole ... probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um you have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report lot so he's bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather you'll be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are show a day ribs utility to borrow money no diver and she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover the amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we've been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be intentional even with the little things there is one thing you can do right now to take care of the little things before they become big things\nIs checked your coverages and make sure you've got them

here a little bit later on with you a or whether they walked in pick the brain of yours but right now let's get on with our family he used to our news we've got a lot of good stories today to share relating the family history starting with the greatest of all times Muhammad Ali\nThis is going to knock you out I'll tell you the genie a logical world has just weren't that great Muhammad Ali is actually the third great grandson of archer Alexander who was one of these people from history you probably wouldn't know about but he is actually the model for the emancipation statue in Washington DC yeah\nWith Lincoln ... on that yes it is somewhat controversial because it it shows Lincoln towering over\nThis slave being you know lifted to freedom but nonetheless he was the guy and that's the third great grandfather Mohammed Ali and it was discovered because one of all these third cousins did DNA and to work and figured it all out what a great story it's\nIt's unbelievable the history that we find when we don't even think we're gonna come across it and of course I I just hope that none of my third cousins find any interesting stuff that I don't discover right [laughter] hey by the we didn't you meet\nAli a couple of times you actually four times I got to meet him and and every single time just a delight with anybody\nHum and I'll be a couple of times you actually four times I got to meet\nHim and and every single time just a delight with anybody he met he loves kids he was pleasant he was funny he enjoyed himself and it didn't matter how much people were pressing on him are demanding whatever it was he was just one of the nicest people I've ever met and I've met a lot of celebrity\nSo what does he do he takes the family Bible to the local pets in office that pension officer makes this beautiful transcript of the family record and they have a nice notary signature on it you know it's all nice and official but in that pension file\nIt mentioned the twelfth child and the child of a little boy named William only lived a few days but he was\nBorn and he died that Twain censuses and both for Ohio was keeping civil birth and death records\nSo now you have hopefully completed the family\nYeah it's complete as far as that family Bible appears to be and from what other records I have found but I just thought it was fascinating that out of the three brothers and they're\nVery robust civil war pension files only one of them had this family Bible and it was only in that family Bible that list that that other brother of theirs who sadly died and infancy\nPoint and this is why it's so important to look at those siblings I had a similar thing back in Nineteen sixty eight to my mother approach to my dad's aunt who would have been a check because she was my great aunt\nAnd she provided all kinds of little family history notes from her memory\nThat proved over the decades to be very useful and she sent him just a few months before she died and she had mentioned in there the married name of his sister of my great great grandmother who had been a brick wall for decades\nWhen I started to work on this side of it and figure boy if I could find out about this sister in fact I stumbled upon a record that mentioned the name saloon\nIn a record that also contain my great great grandmother and going wait a minute that was the name and aunt ... notes so I started tracking this woman and then found that the sister\nAnd from a result of that she lived longer than my great great grandmother to a point where the death certificate started carrying the names of the parents in New York City\nSo when my great great grandmother died in Brooklyn and Eighteen Seventy nine there was no such place for the names of the parents but by Nineteen hundred there were and so the gave the name of the sisters parents which of course where the parents of my second great grandmother\nAnd when I found the questioning of the sister I got the maiden name of the mother and then was able to find all the children that were Christian including my own second great grandmother so\nThat took me back not only that generation but also one more generation to the parents of my great great grandmother mother so it was really useful to find the sister and not just work on the direct line\nExactly because each child in the family has the potential of\nCreating records that are going to give us the answers that we're looking for like like you said that one sibling who last long enough to live into an era where they have really good death records and gave you that clue that you needed to move back another generation but if you had focused\nSolely on your direct ancestor you might still be\nBeating your head against that brick wall I think you're right because it went back over to London and and it was just very different it's always hard to to cross the pond I think\nYeah and when you have a situation where you're wanting to across the pond you need to do as much research as you can on the side and yeah and that includes researching that extended family because\nYou're going to need all of the clues that you can can make sure that you're researching the right person over and the other country and not just someone with the same name\nBoy I think you hit it right on the head and you know Amy one or the other side of researching the siblings is the fact that sibling stories often have to do with your direct ancestors who if you found some distant cousins that might have some oral history or some stories in their lines you could discover some stories and their concern in your people\nDirectly which I think would be really important\nOh God for that way and I think sometimes when we're thinking about doing an oral history or you had just talking to someone in the family you know we hear the advice often and it is good advice to approach that people in the older generation you know if you're fortunate enough to have somebody\nYeah good advice to approach that people in the older generation you know if you're fortunate enough to have somebody in a generation further back than you are\nBut sometimes I think we get so focused on generation being that direct ancestor like well you know my my grand my grandmother is still living so I Can't interview her but could I interview her sister who is still living\nSure you know could I interview her brother\nAnd I think we also need to expand it a little bit thinking about like you said thinking about those cousins I'm actually\nThe youngest of twelve grandchildren and my older cousins have completely different memories of our grandparents\nThan what I have sure grandpa died when I had just turned six so I have just as precious memories of him but in talking to my cousins you know I hear the story about how every year he dressed up as Santa Claus and\nHear the stories of what he would go around the house and just how jovial he was like oh you know kind of makes me a little sad that I didn't get to know him better\nBut I think we need to pull out some of those stories from people even within our own generation but who have a different perspective on things that that we have and things that we've experienced because no two people are going to see the event exactly the same right\nAnd especially generational right I mean a child that looks at an adult are completely different way than say a sibling or appear or a friend because they experienced them as adults obviously and have that adult like relationships with people of different around children and it's it's fun to hear how they were in their different roles within life\nRight and I think it's so neat if you can find someone who knew your ancestor younger than you remember that yeah\nYou know I I look at pictures of my dad and it's like wow that\nHer you know where do you want and you had [laughter]\nAnd talking to people who knew him when he was in high school or when he was just starting a business it's something that obviously I Would never be able to experience firsthand\nAnd sometimes they don't even though I can still ask dad different things that's interesting to get someone else's perspective\nRonald ... and the other side of this is a good dad doesn't necessarily remember all these other things you know how it goes everybody has long collect a piece of memory somewhere but you know really what we're getting down to here is that no person is an island\nAnd they have experiences essentially in relating or having experiences with other people and when you can find those people who can share those memories you can get some just golden stories and it's really fun also when they disagree [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] totally and\nYou get together with my two sisters and we started talking I was like well now here's what happened now this is how it happened and the third one\nYeah at trying to figure out okay which one of these really is correct\nAnd usually it's a little bit out of each one because as you said we all have a different perspective on things and we all have just different memories how we remember thanks what was important to us at the time can also affect how we remember it\nAnd you never know what you're going to come up with when you start getting sideways with your family and work on those sibling lines and find their stories and also find their records great stuff Amy thanks so much thank you\nShe's Amy Johnson crow you can follow her at Amy Johnson crowed dot com lots to think about their and coming up next to have you ever wondered how your ancestors did coming across the ocean what were the stories they experienced what ship where they on what happened during that journey\nWell David Allan Lambert the chief genealogists of the New England has George any logical society in American ancestors dot org is going to talk about that with us coming up next phonics dream genes\n[noise]

know what you don't\nSometimes I tell people I have plants when really I'm going to mindlessly girls are less socially and until my battery runs out\nShe didn't need to know that when it comes to insurance the more you know the better like knowing Geico is the second largest auto insurance in the country plus they've been around for over Seventy five years and have a Ninety seven percent customer satisfaction rating\nAnd you know we were talking to Amy Johnson crow a little bit earlier about getting sideways with your family interviewing siblings and aunts and uncles not your directs themselves maybe they're gone but a lot of those stories will live with those people\nTrue and you have to preserve that so we have such great technology now\nAnd the records of the ships in the military ships and their photographs to I Know ancestry has a lot of the photographs of the ships that brought our ancestors there is is a great\nBook that's still in print called ships of our ancestors you can use something as simple as you just put it in the name of the vessel I mean you may find that there are more than one vessel over the years with the same name as your ship I mean how many may flowers have there been right I mean so that's the type of thing you can find an image of it and if you have an elderly relatives\nAnd you know if they're the one that came over even as a child get the story and pass it on you know and it it's so important it's something that once these stories are lost their last forever\nThat's it and you know I think a lot of people it's amazing to me because I've always embrace these stories\nIt's amazing to me how many of these stories are lost you know the the thing I often hear from people when I talk to them is oh I Wish I had asked that question oh I Wish I had known at that time you know what how much I Would miss this but you grow into it\nAll right I mean even as a child when I interviewed my grandmother who was alive till I was eleven I mean I asked the birth marriage and death questions what field into a chart heard other stories like the one about her dad beyond the whaling ship so that's kind of a vessel story and its own right\nBut I don't have any of the specifics but you don't know what her parents did or didn't tell her sure so sometimes this last a generation before the one that you're interviewing yeah\nThere are so many what other sources are there David to find out about ... of the ancestral obviously if\nYou're ancestor applies for citizenship you get the date of a rival and generally the port and then all you have to do is look at the manifest in so many of these are on line now sure between ancestry and uh things families search has put online for free\nYou can get into so many of them the Ellis

R codes on there too right\nExactly it's the best of both worlds that like you said people want to feel something nowadays they want to accept that something that they can actually see\nAnd they don't have the photo albums so this is a great way to bring all different pictures together by making a calendar and it's not just like twelve pictures\nEven at multiple pictures you mentioned a cue our coach so for instance on Christmas if you know grandma and grandpa or they'll from Alabama and you're in Phoenix, Arizona even have a little cue our code and that the kids use your smartphone and click on a cue our code\nAnd it'll be grandma and grandpa thing and you know merry Christmas or happy birthday our anniversary or whatever you want which is just so crazy\nYeah it really is because it connects right to a website that provides the videos that you do ahead of time I mean that's twenty first century calendars and the best of both worlds\nBut audio is also moving in that direction as well you know we often talk about interviewing ancestors older relatives and getting their stories but there are a lot of people who like to sing or perform music\nAnd oh actually I have a lot of folks are now going to the analog side of things in fact I had a buddy of mine who had a very popular band back in the late Nineteen sixties\nAnd he decided to get the boys back together\nAnd they went and recorded in a studio in Los Angeles with Nineteen sixties ear equipment tubes and Nineteen sixties era microphones and the sound is remarkable and there's something I think with a richer quality\nOops and Nineteen sixties era microphones and the sound is remarkable and there's something I think with a richer quality to that old analog feel\nOh it is in fact that the exact reason of analog vinyl records have come back so much they have a certain Phil or flavor to him that you can't get no matter how well you ... CD no matter how well\nYou do all your transfers you know it's still the digital medium when you have those analog microphones which are the old two microphones\nYou record everything onto an analog tape you take that an editor with the old way that we did with the scissors and such old boy and you can go and make things that just have such a neat villain flavor to him to give any old vinyl thing you know I have a friend I was just talking to on Facebook\nThat was just doing a new arrangement and his newest synthesizer he was used was Fifteen Years old and the oldest is thirty one years old\nAll this old analog stuff even in synthesizer that are digital and the old days they still had that analog quality to them because they weren't like overly digitized\nAnd the sound is just so wonderful and like two microphones not only were they really really expensive they're some of the bigger companies that are actually remaking two microphones now because the studios want him they're very expensive to make and very expensive to purchase\nBut they just have this rich sound that if you want that that's the only way you can go\nThat's what we mean when we talk about a peaceful body a peaceful mind and a peaceful home ... peaceful life sales event is on now through Saturday out a little piece to your life\nWith a new backyard hot tub all models are on sale plus getting instance thousand dollar cash rebate on all him and tore or to sway models\nYou'll save up to thirty five hundred dollars and enjoy some financial peace with payments starting at just Ninety nine dollars oh I see this sale and Sunday so hurry to the ... factory story in Gilbert or come see us our brand new Scottsdale location\nOr frog spas peaceful body peaceful mind peaceful home\n[noise] ARM Glendale, Arizona state we asked them\n[noise]\n... the news\nI'm Brian Clark President Trump's wrapped up a west coast swing campaigning for Republicans head of the midterm elections he was in Nevada on behalf of senator Dean Heller and afterwards told reporters that immigration is a priority in November\nDie down with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi one hour I could have an agreement on that would solve all of the things that you're watching\nThat is so violent\nBut the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said on Twitter quote the president is desperate to change the subject from health care to immigration because he knows that health care is the number one issue Americans care about\nThe president also making news regarding in Nineteen eighty seven pact between Russia and the U.S that prohibits the country from possessing intermediate range missiles\nWe bonded agreements with Russia is not very much so we're going to terminate they were going to pull out\nHe did not specify would that would happen or Russia's violation the CEO of the Washington Post is calling on the president Congress and world leaders to demand verifiable evidence from Saudi Arabia regarding the death of post columnist ...

you have questions for us this weekend about your retirement your investments this market to you can drop us an email through our website is always a great place to start at a winning with money radio dot com\nOr you can give us a call with those questions today it for eight zero six to zero six nine zero seven\nGuys I'm sure after the last couple of weeks a lot of those questions lately of centered around okay what's this market going to do next because if you look last week we had a day where the Dow dropped eight hundred points in a single day and I think that just gets our attention it reminds us that our investments can\nGo down as well as go up and what have you been hearing from your clients over the last several days\nWant to share a little experience with my son he's nine years old okay and uh I was sitting down at the kitchen table trying to get ready for school and he said that they can't find my shoes and I I looked in his room early on and so I think they're under your bed\nNo they're not that I looked everywhere let's go look and see and you know I Walk and I stopped at the door he walks and goes right next to his bed and he's like look they're not here I'm like well come over here stand by the door and as he's down by the door you can clearly see his shoes or just a little bit farther under the thing and\nYou know it was about perspective and the market volatility is about perspective you know two weeks ago I met with a client who came to us six months ago and had a bunch of his stock all in his company and uh we talked about how he needed to have a diversified\nA client who came to us six months ago and had a bunch of his stock all and his company and ah we talked about how he needed to have a diversified portfolio and so we did that and you know we met two weeks ago and he came in and that stock had done really well and he was like I should have stayed where I was\nYou know we should have done da da da da da and so we have the conversation about where are you out in your working career you're five years away from retirement if we had a downturn what would that do with that one stock took a dive\nAnd the next morning after we have this many calmed down and said well maybe I'm having a knee jerk reaction I think that's what you're telling me so let's see\nAnd the very next day ironically I got an email when I woke up that said\nHey feel free to say I told you so not particular company stock has dropped like six percent in one day wow and so you know perspective is hard to do because all we see is the headlines and you know a few weeks ago it was hey ... why is it my portfolio doing what the us and he's doing and then\nYou know now it's gosh is my portfolio losing I'm scared\nAnd so it it comes down to what stage of life you're at and having perspective you know since March of two thousand nine we've had twenty six different occasions where the markets have dropped five percent or more which is you know about where we're at\nA what we've seen and five times of those twenty six that turned into a ten percent correction but we're in a bull market we're in the longest bull market we've been in and so you know there's so many things that affected and it comes down to having a good plan and so that you don't have a beer you want to have conversations with your advisor like Matt and I do saying hey\nThese are the things we have in place to protect you win the markets are not good\nAnd we are looking for number one protection of your principal because you've worked really hard and your biggest enemy now is market downturns and so how do we protect but also grow so that your retirement is going to be successful and you're going to feel comfortable as the market does its thing exactly\nWe all want to make a bunch of money and we all want to take advantage and we all want to pick the next Amazon stock but we don't want to also you know pick the one that goes belly up when we lose all our money either and so it's understanding okay what is my final objective what am I trying to accomplish\nAnd am I invested towards that goal or if I lost perspective I take step back and have kind of a reset\nAnd I love guys that are in this time period you only got two calls from your clients I'm guessing they're probably newer clients and this may be their first time going through a downturn like this with the right\nWell I think what we really strive to do is educate our clients about\nTheir plan and have a detailed a discussion about where money's coming from for income and how the portfolios will perform and adjust according to what's happening with the markets and you know yeah we got two calls but doesn't that was just saying we have proactively been talking with our clients about what's going on\nWith the economy and with the markets in why there's volatility and what's happening with\nYou know the fed the fed has been raising interest rates and they're planning on doing it again why are they doing that\nYou know they're trying to raise interest rates so that when we do see a downturn they have room to lower them to stimulate the economy so is that a good thing\nYeah I think in the in the long term it is but in the short term what's it doing the bond rates it's you know bond rates are dropping there's an inverse relationship there and so a lot of bond portfolios which is typically your safety or steady and you know as as I've not been great and so why is that and having these discussions about\nThis stage of life you know Matt also talked about Warren Buffett sticking to his\nGoals and objectives in his plan of what he knew during the dot com bubble but you know that doesn't mean that if you think about when you\nDecided in your ... how you were going to invest a lot of people did that you know Fifteen Years ago since I've been at the same company and when you're young you have time on your side and you should\nBuy an whole you'd be aggressive you let it ride the ups and downs but as you approach retirement if you're fifty and older you know you want to make sure that if you're sticking to your guns you have the right gun right Warren Buffett new for his stage for his goals\nHis plan was right and he stuck to it and that's what we try to help our clients see because a lot of them come in\nAnd what we see and in fact I met with someone just yesterday who you know they're they're fifty five but they want to retire and five years right most people are looking at still ten years at fifty five and so we had a conversation and said look look at your portfolio and you have all these funds it's looks diversified but as we look\nStation said look look at your portfolio and you have all these funds it's looks diversified but\nAs we look closer they're all large cap and mid ... focused and so your portfolio is going to follow the S. and P. pretty well so we looked at last year and their portfolio and it did and then we looked at it this year and just recently and it was basically following the same trajectory\nAnd so then we went back and said okay well now let's look at if we saw\nA dot com or if we saw\nA terrorist attack and we looked at those different times and what the us in ... during those things and it really scared the pants off one because as they start to draw in top five years from now it's not that far away and if the market hit and had a downturn in the wrong time with the current risk they have in their portfolios they were really going to get hurt bad\nAnd they didn't have the time anymore to recover and he sat back I mean he was he's an engineer so he was you know up right in the seat up there looking at the graph looking at the things and then he sat back and I looked at him and he's like\nOh my gosh he goes this is so eye opening huh and perspective is so important and what we've been doing they've done a great job saving they have a couple of million dollars so it's not like they're in trouble but\nThey didn't want to lose it [laughter] you know they said we've been doing all this thing but what we've lacked is someone to help us understand what happens in the ups and downs of the markets in context of what we're trying to do and that's really what Matt and I think love about our job and helping retirees is helping them\nRealize that you know a lot of times I've done really good now it's a matter of how can we preserve and continue to do well so we have a peaceful and a fund retirement\nWe often talk about it and show that will do a portfolio of you\nFor some of our callers and we limit that because it takes a lot of time and there's a lot of effort with them but what that includes\nAs you can bring in your statements you can bring in what you put together that for all and K that you put together Fifteen Years ago or whatever you might have and with those statements we can analyze that we can go through and we can understand how much risk you're taking we can understand what your performance has been\nHow diversified it is how perform during the good times how perform during the bad times and we can give you all of that data and now we have information to be able to make some changes because again\nWe have a little bit of an eye opening a situation with with the market does not my of woke you up\nBut understanding how bad or how good it could be is going to be critical and so once you have that information then you're going to know what adjustments you need to make in the various accounts to make sure that you're going to build a whether the next door because it's going to be coming when that happens no one can predict that\nBut when we start seeing those signals and times you know that's when people are going to be like oh my goodness I should have done something I should have done something sooner than us and so it's really important to take the time do the analysis understand where you're at so that you're prepared for the next time it's a long term downturn\nExactly and I think this recent volatility is a good reminder guys for those of our listeners who are approaching retirement are already retired you don't have time to let the market just come back that's what we're going to make that offered today for ten of our callers to do that in depth portfolio analysis with Damon ...\nIf you'd like to

talking about how President Trump got elected\nSo interesting Trump got elected in violation of productions of ... no one thought Trump is going to get elected including from had no idea not planning on being like a new one on the staff thought he was going to when I talk to them in the morning of the election at six thirty\nYou know they were planning kind of a graceful exit and then a return to golf course management he wins people in D.C are totally shocked obviously they're embarrassed because it wasn't expected they were humiliated because they knew that his election was of course you know reflected poorly on them and they're predicted skills that on their management of the country\nAnd so they went to the normal stages of grief they blamed him than they blamed his voters would be like if your wife right off the mailman and you know you'd be shocked obviously and you'd be totally ashamed of all your friends and he's like fifty pounds heavier than you and makes half as much and

against and most of the time so how's anything getting done in Washington\nWill not much does [laughter] you know the ...\nThe beauty of Trump that was whether he succeeds in getting his program through or not he's the words hanging in the air\nSo when he says without a border you're not a country that is true and now that he's sent it out loud we'll be debating this into the future we will be you can't take that it's like you get an arguing with your wife you say something horrible you can try to take it back but she never forget what you said\nAmerica will never forget what he said even if you can't pull off himself\nWell so how is this dysfunction affected average Americans\nIt's funny the people who are the angry Esther the people who are the least desperate in other words the
