them refused and so they went forward and as you saw in the news on that big first wave\nBroke through the barriers ah they're on their way into Mexico and went straight and uh and now the Mexican authorities are are dealing with that\nYeah it's not going to share his very intense\nIt was very intense when I saw you down there talking to her Carter she's a word winning investigative journalist and of course contributed Fox but after you know you when you did that you're supposed to be on with his last week and you wouldn't you do that but we were to come on and talk about something that I\nI think we should be talking about more and more and you've got a documentary called a nod in vain coming out about the ridiculous opioid crisis that we have here and ... uh it is what I Do for each gripping and you've got people like you better mother name hardy rigs on their\nWhose daughter just died and you had her on and it is you use this was a real issue we have in this country as er and I don't think people are or or understanding that when you put the numbers we worry about certain things that you know we're always over worrying about stuff we step back for a second ... eighty thousand people died as you're from the flu\nHow many ... hundreds and thousands of people are gonna die from things like opioids there really is used we we should deal with and nobody's talking about\nAbsolutely I mean the opioid crisis is probably one of the most\nPolitically dangerous situations that we have been in as a nation in a long time and the reason why is because\nPeople aren't paying attention to it you know a lot of people think of drug addiction they think of junkies they think of heroin they think of junkies or they think of people on a street corner and some poverty stricken neighborhood and they don't pay much attention to it\nThis is a crisis that is affecting every community across the United states whether you're from a poor family a middle class family or an upper class richer family economically you are going to be affected by this\nMore than one hundred and Fifteen people according to the CDC die every day\nFrom these from these overdoses most of them are young people and let me explain why this became so important to me and to the people who made this film this isn't just about putting a needle in your arm this is about\nThe drug cartels as well as we know the pharmaceutical companies in the very beginning there was a lot of addiction a lot of rising addiction in the United states the federal government's taking care and tried to temper that down as well as doctors not over prescribing but the drug cartels took advantage of this and across the southern border\nAnd in China and in other countries like Russia they're manufacturing setting all\nAnd said no and car set and all and every type of fat and all that you can imagine which was used to be when Dr side of that they used to think of you know anesthesia putting people out this\nIs the most powerful chemical that anyone can imagine and now they're putting it in the drugs and what they've done is they've created these pills that look just like Oxley caught and just like Percocet just like Xanax they're selling 'em on the street\nAnd a lot of young people think I'm buying as an ex or I'm buying a Percocet or they have you know parties in college or in high school and um\nThese pills become available we've seen these pills these pills will kill you\nThe first time you take them if they're not\nPills become available we've seen these pills these pills will kill you the first time you take them if they're not properly mixed and they're not usually properly mix I was talking to undercover DEA people in the documentary over fifty percent of the pills on the street of Ohio\nFake pills they look exactly like the real thing that comes from the pharmacy but they're not they're mixed with that and all and heroin they're leasing marijuana now\nWith that now they're trying to create new addicts so when your children are out there this isn't just about experimenting with drugs are thinking that your child might might smoke pot once or twice what they don't know is that\nThey're being poisoned and these drugs are out there they're killing our young people they're they're creating new addicts they are destroying a generation and that's what this documentary not in vain is trying to expose it's trying to show\nThe bigger picture of this addiction and why we as a nation have to stand up and fight for our children and fight for our country and you know really\nDeal with the facts here who are the people moving these narcotics I mean over eighty five percent of our heroine coming is coming from that southern border so\nEven when we think about these caravans of people even when we think about you know the the porous border nearly two thousand mile border along a our southern border and what could be coming across there just remember\nThere are drugs coming across that border it's not like just say no in the past this is about you better say no or you could end up taking something that will end your life\nAbsolutely you know we talk to her bowling right after his son died and it was you know he said what you didn't have any problems one night he tried something and it was a one off and that's all it needed to be in this stuff is ferocious you know the wall I mean we hear all the stuff about the wall and my my big issue about a lot of this stuff there is the fact that\nWe've got a consumer base here that is the biggest problem is we love to consume you there wasn't a consumer base than than than there would be a need for the talk of the wall and a lot of these things and that to me just a huge problem years how do we attack the consumer base because they're not seeming to get it and there are seeming to want more of it\n[noise] you know we need to start educating our children we need to start paying more attention to our families we need to know what's really happening with our society and why are kids are experimenting\nWith these type of drugs I think a lot of times you know parents don't really think of this as it's going to be a problem with my child and know Heidi rigs you know she looked at her daughter she looks like the all American Girl you look at pictures ever she looks like the next\nDoor neighbor or the high school cheerleader or sports star and even for Heidi she said it was so hard for her to believe\nThat her daughter had become an addict that she didn't even know\nShe would see things like spoons missing out of the kitchen you know and she thought what are these kids doing how many bowls of cereal kept my kids possibly or all the students\nAre missing you know she'd never it never even crossed her mind that her daughter was dealing with some issues that self esteem that she had met this young man um she was very young she apparently felt that she had fallen in love and he introduced her to smoking\nHeroin and\nIs she hit it she hit it so well for him or her own mother and when her mother finally found out and did everything in our power that she knew how to do to try to save her life\nIt just didn't work so from the moment of Heidi tried heroin for the first time until the moment she died she only lived Eighteen months\nShe died two weeks after her twentieth birthday her mom is\nTo get the message out there and the DEA is trying to get the message out there Derrick malts Pettitte former head of the special operations division you know is trying to get the message out there and this has nothing to be ashamed of what we need to do is start\nTeaching our children about what's out there and the ... about the reality of these narcotics you know and who is bringing them across in how these people operate and why we have an addiction so height remember I think you know Chad people from the beginning of time\nHave addiction issues right I mean we're not going to be able to stop every one from doing everything that's harmful for them but where we can do is educate our children hold those accountable who are making\nThese narcotics hold those people accountable tried to put a stop to them because remember this isn't just about gangs selling drugs on the streets this is about narco terrorists organizations there are massing\nHundreds of billions of dollars yes our responsibility to because we're addicts were you know we have addiction and an addiction problem in our country but they're also\nYes our responsibility to because we're addicts or you know we have addiction and an addiction problem in our country but they're also creating these organizations overseas that are potentially national security problems for us\nAnd we know that and all I Know I bring upsetting all over and over again but you know in March two thousand Seventeen I'll give you one example they had a these Eighteen kilograms of fat and all\nThat was hidden in a semi truck in Nebraska\nReady to come from Mexico City or from senora and they had\nThis powder I mean it was it was it was like for this it was sees\nIf it was a relief in open air an open air\nOne hundred and Eighteen pounds of fat and all that we see in a brass got could've killed up to twenty six million people\nThis was during a routine traffic stop this was all over the news in Nebraska we had\nThree thirty thousand I think pills sixty three kilos of powder containing fat and all coming across the Tijuana border I mean this is an enormous amount\nOf narcotics that it's not only potentially harmful to the people that will be buying it or to the police officers who are stopping someone I mean you can teach us from touching the fat and all this is a very serious issue and I think when that our nation needs to pay a lot more attention to\nAbsolutely it's called not in vain sir Carter appreciate your coming on I'll do it again talk about something a little bit more cheery but it was this or

we've got a chunk of money right now about seven thousand dollars were willing to put somewhere but we're trying to decide whether we should put it down on a mortgage which one way or the other will be paid off before he goes yeah by a couple of\nGood uh wars for me to be something um who could build up that the commission and college fund\nGotcha okay and your debt free except your home in addition\nTo the seven thousand dollars do you have an emergency fund a rainy day fund up three to six months or expenses\nWe'd do you how much is in that about ...\nGood okay well you're out what we call baby step for five and six baby step ones with thousands saved too is that free but tiles three is a fully funded emergency fund\nBaby step for is putting Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement which you should just start doing that as a part of your savings you're investing plan right now maybe step five is kids college and beyond that six is pay extra on the house as you can as fast as you can\nShow what I Would do with this money is I Would ever market for school and mission trip\n'cause you guys are obviously LDS right we are yeah OK\nCool so what what I'm going to do is say out of the seven thousand I'm probably going to drop five thousand of it into a five twenty nine for my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for calling\nI've thousand of it into a five twenty nine from my one and a half year old into a good growth stock mutual fund that's all for college has to be used for college\nTake the other two thousand and just said it in a mutual fund in\nYour name no big deal just regular mutual fund and your name and you just on the file when you drop the paperwork into a file right mission trip on the file\nWith us from Springfield, Missouri I Would\nUm my husband and I only just finished SP you were on baby steps to\nAnd for the last five years we have been building our home paycheck to paycheck\nAnd um\nIt's not a hundred percent completed yet we had to borrow money on it or to kind of get things rolling a little bit but um\nWe got an offer to do the care taking position and the guy a got a four hundred dollars a month to take care of his vacation home I'm In the same town we live\nUm [noise] do we tell our home\nOr do we keep it and continue to make a payment on it\nIt's not completed well it [noise] we're at a point it means a paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home\nUm but then we got that offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got that okay so that's so that's why you've never lived in this other house no okay somebody will talk to show them the condition of spam yeah like they can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping\nOr will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar you know and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [laughter]\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year okay so your husband's the only one working well we have a business um it doesn't make it out and running\nIt don't make money his income is about twenty five and Calvin and the business makes about Fifteen thousand yearly okay and then\nGetting the care taking condition or it'll be like in about forty eight hundred cash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got the bar in till you get into if he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have a ... for free anymore that's right so I mean you walk into more and fire you\nPretty much changed my mind and then you you have a housing issue again right so um you have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nOh well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand smart completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and twenty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um because you you it's a further discount than the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer ... bothers out\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on those trials\nAnd so that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling tool to investors and they're going to discount them a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking\nSo um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\n[noise] the house itself we owe thirty thousand but there are some property attached to it so altogether it's a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property as well yes\nThe house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property as well\nYeah okay All right\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars and an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd I'm just continue fanning nine and ... yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a time but you're going to get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here you'll get a little bit but it's not it is it's not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's try and get his sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\n... showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved\nOlivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nGoing to hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd I had a question and I had an African amount of debt and I'm wanting to pay that off you are in recovery for an addiction and an idea that it's going to therapy so [noise]\nAnd I told him she cut budget and\nPet therapy at the end it if I could actually get paid and how kind of quick that I'm not really sure way to pay in the budget or how big of a priority like\nHow long have you been clean and the tribal good for you well known what is it\nActually show or whatever\nOkay All right well no I'm not going to put therapy on hold right now this is something you need you need some accounts or to walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life\nWould you agree with that statement yeah now what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation um the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life\nFifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise they're just not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income\nInjure outgo you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing\nYou're going to feel more energized to make more income and so if this month\nYou don't pay any extra on the debt but you pay your therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay\nBut by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick our life in gear and let's start to clean up the debt ... to ... for today Seventy five whole day's you've been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start right but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [laughter] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see oh your money\nAnd as you and it's not going to be suddenly like a switch flips and you go okay I'm okay now I've got the money no it's not all or nothing it's going to be gradual it'll be incremental you'll feel better you you know when you're\nNinety Days or years four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and\nYou know you're you'll have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more he didn't\nHave to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner with your finish turned the corner and let's let's gone out and then as you make incremental progress\nMore and more than money from your new in Germany or increased income\nThe ... but for the day\nFor more than money from your new in Germany or increased income\nThe debt shot but for today\nWe want to take care of Olivia\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often or you're stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nUm and those are you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a macabre is opening thing up because we are starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing us through what was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has Down syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church and we're just getting to the part where we're working on whales and so because we had the special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting her will together good and through that conversation we uh you\nKnow I'm a we've been discussing a special needs trust or world I'd have to play in planning for our baby's future yeah your\nAnimal ... sure uh originally a kind of had that chopped up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the way that the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five um\nThe uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special conditions with special rules because of course ah you know his his features are boring it's far too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's [laughter]\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy limit for him just like anyone um and we don't have to uh uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as we're getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet but it's coming down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and\nWhile while I trust the trust the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable no you don't you don't need a special needs trust\nUnless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to your dad okay so that\nIt it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed except upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to he was alive as long as one of us alive to manage your assets one of the things you're going to do is care for this child\nWho out of those assets now that the when the ... is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the the the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that ... that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs dress or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy in the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing in the primary beneficiaries your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life\nNot just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars and mutual funds\nOkay your other children are grown and gone or close\nYears from now right that the dream the dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter]\nThat's the legacy by [laughter] but it's out of that then then what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half\nThat's the legacy bribing [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've got you know some portion of my million and a half dollars in my example is going to be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the\nRest of it would go to your ... more traditional airs directly her but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child special needs trust at Twenty years old because he is going to need care and that's a thousand dollars a year it'll produce new that'll take care of him and maybe one of his brothers is the trustee\nAbout them you know\nWhat you would you go ahead like we're doing right now with you for the trust of the week or two you know now and I'm David unfunded or would not let it would make it a court in in the ...\nMarket a clause in the world will be formed on both of your deaths okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing you don't need a shirt that all the time you don't need to go all the legal expense to form a trust so let me give you another example okay ... is a is a special\nConditional version of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up\nAnd moved out on her own their own show my need for a trust to cover my minor children in\nA in a live in both of our best expires\nAt I formed a trust for my minor children at that time it leads to the wire\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case it will be ... you're going to need a trust\nOn death and the ... that's what I Would want that that's how we\n[noise] hey guys quit working

question my husband to check it out and we owe forty six thousand six hundred good lord and um it for forty five now five hundred well that's good we weren't sure how\nMuch of the law to take on it huh\nWell you've already taken the last one you sound like you're just admitted [laughter]\nYeah the thing is worst what it's worth so um yeah you know what's your household income\nAnd many housing okay you have any money in savings at all um we had that marking the ... which one the one thousand dollars okay yeah\nSo how are you going to cover the difference if the truck sells for three thousand less than you I Want it\nUm [noise] I guess I don't\nHave that and paid off pay my faith and credit union I Know\nOkay you need to work out with a credit union to let you have a loan for the difference\nAhead of time ahead of time if you can't sell the truck if he can't cover the difference okay so on\nAnd then yeah I Would be willing to go down I mean two three thousand dollars below what you owe it sounds like it's a one thousand dollar blows the blue book on it but you\nNeed to get this truck sold it's killing you\nYeah\nI mean I wouldn't go I wouldn't do ten thousand and the whole on it but\nI I Would drop down there a few thousand bucks in a heartbeat just to get rid of your stinking payments a thousand a month isn't it\nUm six eighty six eighty okay close enough for her\nYeah so I mean you you you made the right decision to get rid of it it it's an out of control purchase while over the top and out of control and you know you're just going to have so truck for what you can get for it uh and if you can get forty five for five hundred and forty four for five to forty three for it\nYou know you're just going to have cell the truck for what you can get for it uh and if you can get forty five for it fine if you get forty four for it to get forty three four it fine uh you know three or four thousand bucks you know a little small payment is a whole lot more than I have an almost fifty thousand bucks out on a truck\nBecause we've been talking a lot about the millionaire one set the way you think if you're a millionaire around here one thing we found for sure is millionaires think long term they don't think thank God is friday oh God it's Monday\nThey're looking out for word\nAnd they're thinking and there's two things that millionaires do they play all fence and they play defense\nAll fans is they do the right things to build the wealth they do the investing to build the wealth\nYou know investing in your mutual funds and your four one K. investing and paid for real estate they do these kinds of things that defense is avoiding stupid stuff that cause you to lose everything all the progress you've made\nAnd so that stuff like the right kinds of insurance so we'll all that kind of stuff and so having a good solid financial plan is both ... and defense and that is one thing we find one of the data points we find with all these millionaires they really good at defense and um it sounds tedious\n... it can be but we've got a thing to help you with free it's called the five minute coverage checkup\nSo you get your phone out any

it's completely free and they don't really help you I mean it'll help you get that millionaire mindset going and that's what you've got to do Andrea is with us in Pasadena, California Hi Andrea welcome to the Ramsey show\nHi Dave thank you for having me on that um I Am so happy that I'm like my husband and I and ... and we have\nTo be said to me now not totally again we've been living here about three months already okay I'm In trying to see what our next step that we have about\nA thousand dollars in credit card that we have about fourteen thousand in the evening and we have to feel like they're really holding it but we're just not sure what else we can do it that I mean it could come and get rid of them as they're I'm not really sure what to do\nRight well you can we can do some math and determine if you want to just ride them out\nOr if you want to sell the car\nNow if you want to sell the car here's what you would do and you need to get this information gathered up you need to call the fleece company and ask what the early buyout is meaning if I wrote you a check did day to get my title what would it be\nThat should be less than the total love your remaining lease payments plus the residual value the buyout at the end\nOkay and so you get that number that's like the early pay off without the interest on a car payment okay\nJust same thing in the early buyout number that's what you're looking for and then you compare that to the value of the car have you done that on any of these cars\nYeah we have on both of our vehicle\nOh wow okay so we got the actual numbers always talk about vehicle number one that was the early buyout\nThat early buyout is thirty thirty\nDollar okay and and what the value on that car the value of that car I Believe he looked at it it's like twenty five okay Caroline Blue Book private sale yeah yeah my husband is that it's thirty two that's how much it's I'm kind of labor about I'm Sorry thirty two or twenty\nI made a mistake it that the early ... thirty three ... and kept the Kelley Blue book number is thirty oh great\nOkay so you can only lose a thousand dollars by selling that car you'd only write a check for a thousand dollars it'd be sold it for thirty two but you had to give the least company thirty three to get the title you're a thousand in the ... right\nRight right now your lease payment is how much\nMy statement is five hundred and forty two dollars in life\nAnd how many how many payments remaining what we have about Eighteen market man okay\nRight I'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred\nAnd how many payments remaining\nWe have about Eighteen market man\nOkay All right I'm just putting that in here that's nine thousand five hundred and Seventy six dollars mhm mhm so if you sell it today you lose a thousand if you keep it you lose ten thousand\nYeah no brainer salad okay okay you see how the analysis now let's look at the second one then right what's the value of the second one\nSo the value of the second vehicle is twenty five okay in\nThe early buyout on it\nThat early buyout on it at ... o'clock in the early\n... twenty five okay I haven't done the Kelley Blue book 'em out but I'm sure it ... I think actually I live in town and for that one where really in the hall okay and what is the lease payment on it\nBut at least payment is two hundred and thirty dollars a month or right and how many of those are remaining fourteen my payment\nK. so that um let's see here two thirty and therefore it in his thirty two hundred dollars\nIf you keep the car till the end of the leash and hand them the case right yet as to thirty times fourteen okay and that one is somewhere around fourteen thousand and the whole today okay so you get to drive this car for free\nUntil the end of this lease on that one you keep it because I'd rather lose thirty two hundred and fourteen thousand and I drive the car\nOkay you see what I'm going yeah comparing a total of your payments\nAgainst the amount you're in the hall\nSo that one that one I Would probably keep it for your husband's numbers are correct on the value I suspect there I suspect you're going to keep it anyway because I don't think he's going to be that far off I mean we've got a fourteen thousand dollar deficit right now if he if he's eleven value is right\nBut even if he's half wrong it's still a seven thousand dollar deficit versus three thousand to keep it\nSo that one we keep\nOkay and you pay it out now it's is it overall miles\nNow that one way I'm dry mouth\nOkay and the wear and tear you're going to keep it up so you're not going to have to write a check when you turn it in fourteen months from now\nNow they're both saying that well that one thing great condition\nOkay good good yeah that one or you see how I did that analysis\nYes yeah that really clear that ... we were really struggling with what you\nKnow keeping that one and you know what I Would do is move on past a baby step to once you've gotten rid of the the big car the more expensive one and\nOnce you've gotten rid of all your other debts except this but if you still have this one with the two thirty payments were just rent in the car all the way through the end here and you might as well keep the car you get no advantage to turning it in our early right right you're\nGoing to like the three thousand two hundred and twenty dollars worth of two hundred and thirty dollar payments no matter what you do so you might as well drive the dad gummed car you know and um if you want to put thirty two hundred dollars aside extra in your emergency fund just to make sure you got that plus your emergency uncovered the call yourself in baby steps\nTwo and three then that's fine\nBut that's how you do the analysis on whether to keep a leash or not\nAnd um most of the time unless you're close to ... unless you're close to the end of the lease you're going to be selling the car and that's what happened with the more expensive one there it's killing you now that one was a beach bite ya\nSo good question thank you for joining us ... ... if you've never heard the saying it's kind of a country saying you're getting ...\nWhich means it it's it's like a a a sheep getting it's far removed that's where it comes from your getting ripped off as well ... that's why I call them car fleet says because if we take the value of the original\nMarket value of that car that thirty three thousand dollar car on the expensive one there for those folks and I put that five forty two into a calculator and then I put the end of value into a financial calculator with residual value at the end in other words the residual values what you can buy the car for at the end of the lease\nYour your games up number at the end of the least you put those numbers you know the calculator you come back out what the effect of interest rate is\nIn motion of the time it's around fourteen percent\nThey call it costs to Capitol\nAnd they don't have to disclose the interest rate the AP are to you you know if you get a car loan you get this there's truth in lending sheet that the Federal Trade commission make she makes them show you the a PR the annual percentage wretched you're being charged but when you're leasing it's technically not that\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting a car\nAnd so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest\nAnd so you 'cause you're renting a car\nAnd so they are not required federally to disclose the cost of capital or the interest rate but you can figure it out with a calculator that'll make you a Pew [noise]\nI mean it's ridiculous that's why we call it ... it's the most expensive way to operate park the car leasing is a disaster\nIt's a disaster as a financial issue [laughter]\nYou could just do the math you can understand what I'm saying\nThis is that I ran for\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nA meal and having such and having kids that are so young too to know that we can do whatever we want and we're not we're not tied down\nOn you know we don't care that I mean you're making two forty here you've got no pay which is a worry Thirty years\nMark ...\nGr yeah and I don't\nKnow we had some hard times we did not happening was not easy you know it wasn't wasn't a just a cake walk the whole time but but we uh we worked hard and I think it brought us together for sure we um we always had a goal that was\nThat was right in front of us and that that was one thing we didn't fight about I mean like any other company we fight about stuff for sure but that one we were I Know that one being one of the most important ones we we're not we're on the same page\nLove it yeah that's one of my biggest thing even with a telling people I mean when we're hosting a leading a few classes biggest thing is I get on the same page and he has we never find enough money\nMhm also really cool so do they listen when you told me\nSo\nI think we definitely have some resistance definitely you know it's um all the stuff you're talking about why would you if you can get zero percent interest why would you not do it it's free money ... no you don't get it\nAs a differential what is the key to getting out of that you've done at your coaches your blood classes you've done

hundred and fifty dollars for a super low income students all other schools get three hundred dollars per student the teachers directly responsible for the passing scores get at least half of the money under state law so that that's not a bad deal well I'd like that\nIt's not bad\nI was amazed at how do you want to sit down it doesn't sound feasible but I understand why he wants to try it let's keep\nThis in mind there really isn't any perfect idea here correct okay for a lot of ... a lot of ideas you take the best of the worst ideas now clearly the worst idea was separating families separating kids from their families\nBut Trump says the hours idea was this catch and release he does I got like catching really I don't like it\nEither I don't like it either but but what else can they do I get to tell you I Know that we you and I've only had about Fifteen minutes to kind of absorb this digested a little bit\nUm if they could build places for these people to live in comfort and make it safe and keep them there and not let them into the country it might not be a bad idea it all depends on how they do it it might not be a bad idea this actually might work but you know people\nPeople are going to challenge it saying these people have had a hard time they've cut and now we're now we're putting them in a tent city prison\nThey are coming in our area here because they want to throw we're not forcing them to come to the United states so if you're right I Know we're going to get a look at the tent city and going is that the best humane way to treat just give me another idea then do you want the family should be separated again I don't\nYou know could there be ten cities for just men could there be ten cities for just women I Would assume you out and say ten cities for families\nSo that they can stay together they have to stay together that's the only way that I Would want this if you let's say you've got to asylum seekers from Guatemala mom dad to kids I Want them altogether I don't want them separated\nAnd ten cities\nHow comfortable is that going to be when summer comes into do absolutely no did they have air conditioning and right so so on the surface of it to me it seems like this is a this this is the best of many\nI don't want to call bad ideas there just no there's there's no good way to solve this unless you just seal up the right order you know you build a wall all the way\nThough I Am just not like that idea either I mean they're going to be\nPeople that don't like anything that's Mike I alright that's going on but we will you got to listen you've got to President Trump is in charge right now he's got to try and figure out what he thinks is best\nBut you know that people are going to challenge this with lawsuits and ... which may stop it but do you is what we know now is that he wants to build these tent cities to keep these asylum seekers these migrants for like right on the port of entry for a\nPeriod of time and what time it is we don't know I don't know either I don't know but for\nThese migrants for like right on the port of entry for a period of time and what time it is we don't know I don't know either I don't know but for a period of time do I want them in there for years no I don't\nBut yeah there shouldn't be getting ... ... in limbo for years we they're not criminals right remember even if you even if you sneak into this country illegally you actually have rights yeah you're not treated like a criminal but if you if you come to the if you come to the border and you claim asylum you've got a whole bunch more rights ... okay\nBut if we can keep them housed in some it can't be in filth\nWe can't have the sex abuse that we had here in Phoenix at these places it has got to be done the right way and if\nThey put this administration I don't really I like drag on it I didn't trust Obama's administration to do it either well do I what I was well wait a minute right away to do it in the Trump Administration separating children from their families and they did not have a plan on reunification listen you've got to make sure these people are tracked\nThey have some kind of they're going to have to get healthcare they're going to have\nTo get food there you're going to have just put related can't half to feed them that's my point I mean I got to have a plan right\nRight but uh when you say you know you don't trust the Trump and I don't trust any administration whether they're Democrats or Republicans\nI'm I get what you're saying that this ... this administration ought to be a better thought out has had was cruel when they separated children from their parents\nOkay so this idea of ... we're hearing Trump's going to send not five thousand members of the military to the border but Fifteen thousand that's what he floated out what to do down there you know what they're going to do they're going to build ten cities are going to become guards\nThey're gonna they're gonna guard these places\nMaybe you have to do it [noise] would you rather would you rather have Phoenix area churches have to continue to take care of migrant families week after week after week or would you rather have the the the asylum seekers stay at the border\nI think you're I think you're kind of missing the point though if it's because it's not about the churches necessarily it's that Trump says\nThey don't show up to the court dates like we allow them to just be released and they disappear I'm now I'm going to keep track of them and educate them and decide whether or not they can stay or not I don't think I'm missing the point I think you either keep them at the border from doing it for the churches that was my point he's not doing that because of the church\nNo no question about it you either keep them at the border like Trump is now proposed or you drop them in the valley and they go to a church\nAnd that it might disappear and then they might disappear and so I I'm what I'm trying to say is which one do you like better deal I keeping them at the border where would you rather have been dropped right here in the middle of Phoenix\nAnd then maybe they disappear I'm saying that maybe the better way is going in and keeping them at the border it might not be a bad idea or do it the right way or\nIt could be it has all the sun is the it's all a mid term stunt and nothing gets done and like you and I are like wait a minute what about this idea and there was never a plow many it was always about how\nWe got a big caravan of five thousand people coming here there's a second there's a third and now there is a fourth Caribbean coming from where\nEl Salvador okay we've got a problem and they're trying to figure it out is this the best way maybe it's not the well
