teachers who actually understand what's going on is it gives me a lot of hope\nLet me ask one specific question the road for a movement in your campaign and other whether it's red for ed which are

start at ... laid out on however I checked my way to winning get I can\nUm I Do not know why they think could be a lot of money that I make 'em so if you\nUm how much we can get fat I fate unlike ought to take a pay check 'em you can read about in the early ... and I want to say to that I Am fortunate to have parents kind enough to let you have like free\nThat's very ... what do you make um monthly about eleven hundred and is that and that's after graduating say okay what is your degree\nIt's actually called ... but um I actually got a chat with the tea can help me find my career and\nSo when we're your career kick in\n[noise] um I'm I'm actually quite while I'm On I'm going to the fact that my education will take the call I Fe about and I like to about a year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh\nOut on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need to double your income\nOff pretty quick here as fast as you can and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any dead at all\n[noise] um but I Do have about at a high very at down by twelve thousand dollars a day which my parents um I kind of that too um that they're taking care of that he can establish more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that\nSo they can take the money and they offered to I pay a whole lot of anger\nOr that you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any debt you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent that free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses are like five thousand dollars a set aside for emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also\nIn your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you what you said you're twenty four okay good well you got a good plan\nSo hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up\nAs you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know your Thirteen thousand when you get your twenty six thousand quickly to regain this doubling that's still not a lot of money but that'll at least get you out there and get you moving in and get your career to start to build so hey\nThanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us in Prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\nAn idea thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I we've got five boys five kids and we just moved into our dream on all three years ago or ten twelve acres along through because it could turn around but the last few months which is what is your plan where they just have to\nAnd tortured thinking um when we got thirty five thousand undead besides the house\nWe're just not sure if we want and we need to sell the house just to be the free or which is called through the next ten Fifteen Years and just make it happen\nTen to Fifteen Years\nWe meet payroll house and everything\nYeah like whoa where you know we have twenty eight years left my mortgage\nMm So what's your house you hand them\nIt's about Seventy K take home pay\nTake home but All right yeah and um then what is your house payment\nIs around twelve hundred\nAmong the house payments not on the line here that's fun now on but you got a lot of\nKids you got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah because you've got thirty thirty five hours to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take you year and a half two years but something like that you know longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up right what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of debt\nA or the lock my parents and part of it is my credits twenty five on a credit and ... and learn from our parents\nOkay All right so just a line of credit what'd you bond with a line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been here about a piano a few years ago I just missed pointed spring\nOkay and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free yeah we love the place\nI don't think they need I don't think you need to sell the house houses knocking on your\nTwelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home by not at all on your oh you're okay on her house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five 'cause if you concluded the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids\nAnd you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou can do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and that's how I'm landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nI have a great got how can I help [noise]\nSo I Would go wandering about emerging pick on we have a fully funded an emergency I knew it out of the three to six months [noise] good to have about\n... came out and then now I'm at my job for a trip out on the match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should\nShould I fully fund the account and should account that towards the handle or\nEmergency Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course you can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for a single income\nNo couldn't do that again what's your household income of around sixty and what do you do er nurse\nYour nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one and twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back at all you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that\nGiven that you've got that type of a career that's not so specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something like your six minutes um\nThen given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at it you find that I just say\nBetween the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to about three months\nOkay and so that's kind a like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose your job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car and all kinds of things that\nCan happen that aren't medical and you can't use the ages for anything but medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact he got a big fat ... with a big fat match on just a wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being on the three months side of the three to six months [noise]\nRain for your emergency [noise]\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listened the whole point of life insurance just replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse\nSure you have kids yes unique term life insurance it's the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and the build up your wealth\nHe just did this last night so wow congratulations and everything so who are your biggest cheerleaders each other yeah\nWe were absolutely we were in in in in your guys as ministry hands down\nAlso very cool well we're glad we're part of it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely right well what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nI'd say there's a few things obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles in trials in life that if you guys I'm working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to square your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and\nIt wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three jobs she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go in because I have a lot of time off with my job and I I didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in ... at a University in and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and it's you know what what did you make it that game with hum my average income is probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five up how much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I I got the only lease it I think he would approve

she'd come back to Arizona a number of times but\nWe're at times but the one time she came back in August\nShe hasn't gone back has going back to the view a ... and you don't want I don't blame her when you lose a parent and I've learned this from my wife who lost her mom a number of years ago\nOf which is the line to the FBI charge which we've seen charged ah in the in the last year or two\nIn a number of high profile cases so us so they do have to be mindful of the fact that they have to be honest and they can't be intentionally misleading or or or lying and I think\nThat will uh you know create a situation where these witnesses\nIf they do speak and they do cooperate and it sounds like so far everybody's said they're willing to cooperate they're going to have to be honest with the with the FBI now as we're talking about something that happened thirty five years ago so it's very possible that their memories just may not be as clear and and maybe at some maybe they didn't see anything\nAnd uh and and they just can't you know ... recall you know based on the fact that that whatever happened it didn't involve them and uh you know in the case of Dr Ford maybe there were people that were at this party but he just don't remember it because there was nothing significant now maybe they do remember\nYou know the fact that uh there were there was a doctor for it and or her friend maybe they they understand who they are but maybe they realized that there was never a party that they once it went through with them so\nSo these kinds of possible scenarios that are going to occur or the FBI and I got a point this out I'm Rachel Mitchell the a prosecutor who's representing the Republicans and the hearing you know she said\nThat the that Dr Ford and the various other people are going to need to go through a forensic interview and that is the kind of interview that the FBI is now going to conduct\nAnd that may potentially opened up you know people's memories and get them to recall certain bits of information and and that might help the overall investigations swept to see but that those are the kinds of things that I expect as\nWhat what is that we're in this one of the forensic interview what does that mean\nI'm a forensic interview as a kind way of saying methodically interviewing somebody letting them tell their story\nThe agents will receive that story but they're not just going to take that story at face value they are going to question the person who's telling them that story whether it's Dr Ford sweat neck a ... any any of the witnesses they're going to ask them questions they're going to probe\nTheir story to try to figure out if that story is is credible um they're also going to probe the person who's telling that story to determine is there any kind of motivation for why they're telling the story some kind of a hidden agenda\nI mean these are the kinds of things that we do in the FBI all the time\nI mean it you somebody comes in and provide information again you're not taking that at face value you're taking that information you're going to question them to try to determine if they're being honest or misleading or there's some kind of hidden agenda I Can't tell you how many investigations I was involved in where people were alleging a certain type of crime was going to be occur occurring\nAnd those were hoax threats that were being provided the hoax allegations and people went to jail for doing something like that so the agents are going to be looking for that they're going to be looking to see\nIf the person they're talking to is credible what their motivation is and then Kennedy corroborate that information that they are receiving\nAlright the FBI investigation is underway and trying to figure out what the FBI's dealing with this week who they're talking to and how they're going to do their investigation returning with retired FBI special agent\nAnd ABC News contributor Steve Gomez how about the actual investigation is being controlled by the White House are there are limitations on what the FBI can do and who they can ... who they are allowed to talk to\nYou know this isn't being controlled by the White House once once the White House\nApproved for the opening of the supplemental background investigation it's now in the hands of the FBI and nobody is telling the FBI at least the FBI with this current leadership\nDirector Wray deputy director tape outage associate deputy director Paul debate I Know tape outage and Paula ... these two leaders are not going to let anybody tell them how to conduct a background investigation or any investigation and that's what the FBI is about\nIndependent objective and stare and that's what you're going to see in this investigation right here I I have full confidence and what is going to happen in this investigation they the only limit that was placed on the FBI was you're going to conduct this investigation and seven days that's it\nSo now it's up to the FBI to determine what credible allegations\nThey need to investigate who are the people that are the cruise accusers the witnesses and he documents they need to gather whatever information they need to pull together and the investigation that's what they're going to do they're going to make that decision is not the White House\nAnd he chief of staff or a special counsel no it's going to be within the FBI and they're going to make that decision their deadline seven days\nTheir deadline seven days I expect them to complete this investigation by Wednesday some time maybe earlier maybe a little later but they're going to need at least a day or so to get all those reports together or provide a summary of what they found her in that investigation and provide that to the White House and ultimately the Congress\nDoes your got tell you they're going to find something damning here\nI just don't know I I I think there is going to be a ... a challenge in developing information credible concrete information going back thirty five years I mean ... memories are going to be a very vague\nAnd it's going to be very difficult to get the kind of concrete information\nThat you would want in any kind of cold case investigation I mean this is very similar to a court case investigation that I've conducted\nDealing with cold case homicides or unsolved murders unsolved a violent crimes that um that I used to be involved in that working gangs and violent crime that those those are the challenges and you usually you were talking about ten years Twenty years back this thirty five years ago\nSo it's going to be a very big challenge and I think we're going to find more information because of the fact that they are now going to do a very methodical detailed interview with the accusers and with the witnesses and with that\nYou're you're going to get more details you're going to get a lot more than what you get when you have a public hearing where you have a number of politicians that are grandstanding on both sides of the political aisle\nAnd they're not really interested in some ways they're interested in you know what what what are the facts and what the truth\nBut they're also grants that they're also trying to score political points you saw Rachel Mitchell the way she handled that uh those interviews of both Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh that is that kind of interview that you're going to be seeing\nBehind closed doors not with cameras and not with fanfare closed doors confidential and that's how they're going to do it I think I think
