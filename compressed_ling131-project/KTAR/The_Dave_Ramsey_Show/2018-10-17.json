show\nI thank you for taking my call sure what's up in your world\nWell I'm currently banned from right now I I have a lot of student loans and I have a credit card debt that I'm trying to you know pay off but that's the amount of of income that I have that on her life it's not really able to like you know even\nTouch or pay off the wall but I Will look at the off the credit cards but I'll just take a few months for that to happen\nYou know um yeah so I'm a single mom I have um I have a six year old son Don ... well they came from um when I went to Harvard law school so um I ...\nI'm Sorry did you complete pharmacy school\nI didn't go to because like all this happened last year um I hadn't got and I had gotten from the program because I had a serious highly emergency that kinda jeopardize the day and I had to withdraw my application I picked out of the program so I have a lot\nOf how long were you and I don't how long were you in pharmacy school\nA four by four years\nYou were in for four years four years yeah I Want you to do ... how much did you let graduating\nUm I only had three quarters left and completing the on campus um course work and then I had one in ... after one year you graduate and they get bored and become a far with it\nYou know what level of family emerging she would keep you from going across the finish line\n[laughter] well\nI I have a parent that has like a controlled high blood pressure and diabetes and high they suffered a stroke or oil closest okay that kind of um [noise] how can take out a full theory care and um you know and\nThe show or you know costs I stole that that kind of um [noise] how can take out a fulfilling care and um you know in terms of how all down and that kind of like you know that's what the guy that I had to study for my my lie on Saturday\nTravis was in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Travis welcome to favor injuries [noise] Hey David how you doing taking my call sure opposite occurred uh settle\nThe debate for my wife and I are all\nGrown up here um we have about Seventy\nFive thousand dollar the debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is in case than at Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we have an idle rain\nFog and how about two hundred and you get any sort of equipment on one what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the question that I that I have faith that we have a um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was not an inheritance on that in ... and she had to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inherited money on it you\nPay ...\nPay off all of our debt and then to repay ourselves back off of that to an IRA so that we don't have to worry about continue repaying the uh interest game if you will or a worry about that is that she um you know she is going to be coming that aren't good for that for our retirement\nUm my record good at it as she forty I'm thirty eight we still have a good amount of time to be putting into our um different finding out you know I guess my my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution of our debt about one or longer paying the\nUm you know the interest rate or should we go at it I hated that down and we are are they will be there for you were there we went out here well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way\nTo wealth what is the shortest distance the wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing in mind that it's not all\nThat in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years in many many people become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes ... do you guys were you agree to use that process\nAnd if you're ... so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that will answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior and it's only twenty percent hip knowledge stuff we're talking about smell really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that\nToo is to be debt free everything but your house you've not done that three is to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about\nFor start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about twenty five or so in our savings account\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was getting ready to ...\nAll your life or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a life in a nice way to earn an eye on him are probably the majority of\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know under five dollars and that\n... ... ... you know\nYou got to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do with the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance immediately to become debt free so that you take all those payments that you don't have any more in years though it was to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nCorrect we we inherited it or not\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hung up the phone call about another somewhere north of war Seventy five\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nUm ... what her financial grant her told her that she had to cut it in a different makers to I'm a cover her at a over the each year here at heart over at the most part because the way to collect the money out of town\nYou know it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... out when I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm In a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt and I'm going to invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control and know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something\nLike that I honestly don't think that's what you all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this and to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and

account instead would depending on the severity of our offices and\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens to the money to five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and penalize it'll be taxed and heavily penalize\nSo um\nKnow the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and on where you get a special needs situation like this I Would use the able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual fund and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money or to your marketing it for them for their future\nOr they may do a trade school they may do or they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing but you simply going just save money\nIt's as simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to the only advantage of the table or the five twenty now and it's just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nAnd the question is is at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving the mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it where I can get my hands on it and I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push it ... does two things uh ... in a traditional ... situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefits but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do um\nSo we're letting grow but in this situation I\nUm you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do\nOr let grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is
