this was you could put judge Wapner judge Judy judge Joe Brown judge dread Aaron Judge from the uh uh from the New York Yankees ... anybody there\nAnd this was the fight and the right would have done the same thing if the left had the opportunity I Do people talk about America and you know one of the things that I don't think people realize Ninety seven percent I think is what they very Garland in him agreed on about Ninety seven percent of the cases\nThat that's pretty damn good right I mean it was climate change be all over but if it's this G so well look at this and this is one thing we're going to touch on throughout the evening is the fact that I think there's two camps here\nYou've got an older generation a Gen actors you know mid to late thirties\nEnded the fifty forties and fifties and sixties who who who lived\nIn a day and age of the Mad Men and some not so much of the crazy eighties and things of that nature and then you've got a younger generation of micro aggressions and things of that nature and when you look at this I think there's two ways that this me too movement is going\nA lot of women want people to understand the things that they have gone through that have been absolutely off the things that they've gone through that has been horrible the things that they've gone through that that really they they want people to know and we absolutely should\nHave another generation which I Believe the younger generation is is looking at this is this is a weapon\nRight and it's not by the way it's not just the me too movement for the younger generation\nThe fact is micro aggressions things of that nature but ... you and I talked about this with the yesterday that company last year where the interns decided they wanted a new dress code because they thought it was sexist and it was wrong and they went into the guy who owns that company and then the next day he fired them all\nAnd they couldn't understand why they couldn't understand why and this is the issue I think a lot of people are saying you've got two camps here fighting and it's it's it's really amazing to see because when I talk to younger generation\nIt is you've got to believe everybody period case closed when I talked to an older generation they still believe in due process\nThey couldn't believe what she's saying but they also want facts the younger generation just believes what she's saying or what somebody and they don't even care about facts you're guilty and even if you're proven innocent we're never going to change your mind about your and tell you that\nAnd that is it and like I said I think part of it is the entitlement world that we live in for these young kids all of us in some way shape or felt we had a little bit of entitlement the differences we've raised an entire generation with\nYour the past year the greatest you're all of this we've lawnmower parents mowed down everything in their path we've got people who've told their kids are the great things in the history of the world everybody gets a trophy\nGeneration are little one time we knew we all didn't get a trophy\nRight genetic we knew that\nRight mom and dad might have thought you were great but they always reminded you that the world may not think your great it's different here you're micro aggressions all of this stuff and I think the ... there is a there is a big gap between how in the older generation has gone through stuff and the younger generation where even looking at somebody it's considered sexual assault\nIt it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out it really really is three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... best in show is your Twitter we've got a whole area is\nStory about cheerleader speaking of young kids are and and and brownies we'll talk about that but first let's look at the economy more cameras bank rake dot com joined us we're going to talk about the economy and how well it's doing if it's doing well and who gets credit for that suggested you\n\n[noise]\n... show [noise]\n\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanics mind something wrong and surprise you hit with a huge repair bill\nAnd what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty your paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's why I recommend extended vehicle protection from Garcia if your

by car shield you can have your favorite mechanic or dealership fix your car it's your choice of course shield also provides\nPopulation and so every time we get essentially twice that we are continuing to winnow away a thorough meaning so called slack on the workforce so\nI think there's every reason to be optimistic about basically the short end and intermediate terms\nA look at this and and I look at all of this across the board and I said to myself this looks this looks good strong and then we get to the political side of things and I want you to listen to to what Don Lemon said the other night\nTeam from to tread very carefully here because when it comes to the economy Trump got a lot of inherited a growing economy a growing economy inherited it\nFrom his predecessor jobs are being created at roughly the same average rate as under President Obama wages are growing at about the same rate they did\nUnder President Obama\nThe left is never going to get Trump credit and when I was listening to this the first thing that came to my mind is Michael Jordan had other coaches before Phil Jackson as they'd Kobe and Shaq but they never want any championships till he showed up\nA Trump you know the left is never going to give them credit but the reality is is\nYou know when is it going to be is economy and and it has he help the economy 'cause I think he absolutely has to help the economy not only from a point of how I think he's taking some of the shackles off and let it grow but I've also think he's the economy and the confidence level which rarely gets talked about\nWell a obviously a lot they're a very complicated ah ...\nAnd I'm generally hesitant to try to get involved with a playing\nA well with either side when it comes to tribal politics 'cause I have very little patience for it but having said that to try to answer the question\nUh you know the buck stops here at a you know on Pennsylvania Avenue and so it is Trump's economy now and it will be for as long as he's an office in the same holds true for when President Obama was an office shore a you know the president the current president\nCertainly had a gift but he did not come into office when Brock Obama came into office when you were losing seven hundred thousand jobs a month you know we were all working then and and and knew the horror of that\nUh and the fact that we were able to piece all that together at least as well as was the case in some ways as a miracle because the economy nearly\nCompletely fell off a cliff back then um but the president did one thing I think which has been key to energizing growth and that was to advocate for the tax cut or some people think that the\nPersonal income tax cut was number one um [noise] not equitable with respect to benefiting all aspects of the population\nOr in other words at favorite the wealthy and people like Jamie diamond the C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase for these past fourteen years among others uh would say that he did not himself need a tax cut but I think there's broad agreement that the piece that has to do with empowering business to do better on the world stage\nDid need work and uh so I think the president and his Republican counterparts on Capitol Hill deserve\nUm the credit\nTo the extent that they did advocate for a broad a bit of tax relief a which is helping the economy probably for the next couple of years so there's I don't think there's any getting away from that\nTalking to mark ... dot com as we discuss the economy and because we also just the one thing I started telling me that we all share in the economy I get what you say you're right left he's not my president he's my president tribal politics all the stuff we all share and the economy we buy things we sell things we work we have homes and got things have got to take care of\nRight now the market itself is the job market is good you're seeing more and more people to feel confident enough to quit their jobs in it and I always like when people say well you know the growth rate for for jobs as far as money is it what it was a lot of ways I tell everybody because very rarely do you get a raise your work a lot of times what you do is you jump across the street\nBecause they're willing to give you a raise that your company is not going to match\nSo there's a lot of that I don't think it's added in when you look at this marketplace you look at the job place if you're somebody right now is this a great time for entrepreneurs is a great time to jump jobs is this a place where you feel like now is the time to strike\nWell I think you know first of all if you're operating in the United states of America\nAnd I just states of America and again in a political comment as a nationalistic comment as it turns out if you're operating in the usa\nYou have the opportunity to do something that no one else in the world can do because we have the widest deepest capital markets we have the greatest innovation in off the planet and that's why we continue to create companies that do things that really don't exist anywhere else\nSo all large businesses used to be small businesses we know the legends about Steve Jobs and\nA Jeff Bezos beginning in their garages so they were small businesses to begin a there are some measures out there that suggests and there are a little controversial but there are some measures out there that suggests that small business is growing as well as it used to\n'em and I'll just sort of ...\nLeave that there for the moment ah and there are some who are sharply critical of the growth of the likes of Facebook Google um Amazon the list goes on and on saying essentially a they are crippling tech entrepreneur as I'm biased actually doing what Facebook did buy\nA essentially buying Instagram and then seems to be in the process of killing Snapchat so there you know those are all inevitably a questions that have as much to do with regulation as anything else\nBut to the broader point I think it's All right now is a superb time to be looking for work to be starting a business\nAnd you know people always have challenges no matter what the point in our history uh they happened to be doing that you know if you people succeeded by building businesses in the midst of the depression for goodness sake and and the same can be said of in two thousand seven two thousand eight two thousand nine so\nIf somebody has the vision that has a great idea and is willing to work hard\nAh the United states as a as a great place to do that as anywhere I think\nA man I Love having you on my man will do it again next month the more cameras demand with the golden voiced bakery dot com have yourself a good weekend we'll talk to you soon\nYou're very kind to thanks so much always a pleasure to be\nLike you actually had been some shows your Twitter C.

[noise]\n\n\nLand Ramsey\nIs getting paid\n\nOn Dave Ramsey your host\nYou jumping we'll talk about your life and your money it's free call AAA eight to five five to to ah [noise]\nI think I'm getting old because I'm getting more and more in the style chick\nI was thinking this morning about the neighborhood I grew up in and you know as you\nGet older you don't remember the bad stuff all your does remember the good stuff and so it's very I'd be like in your mind it was an idea like neighborhood it was incredible is full of kids\nAnd we were always doing something you ever get a ... a piece of plywood out and put a couple of bricks up under it and go across it on your bike like evil can evil you're jumping and it didn't go well and you go over the handlebars I mean have you ever done stuff like that and we didn't worry much\nI mean we play baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call 'cause we we'd we'd always argue about whether somebody is out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in and out of each other's houses and one mom always had some lemonade when mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood\nAnd I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man\nI Want to go to school you know be cool to go to school when I can go to school I'll be happy then you ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it\nI'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then\nAnd when back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school and and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right\nAnd so you're like man I could just get in\nThe sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be the I'd be ruined the school man\nI'll be happy then then you finally get\nThe sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school or middle school which was\nSeven eight nine the school I went to and man if I could just get out sixth grade and gold their middle school you know they've got they've got P. E. they've got football they got cheerleaders surely\nWe're glad you are here but NASA and Miami, Florida five an hour you\nHave to pay them off thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nA few years ago I resigned are charging for Florida prepaid college plan and my husband and I were both making more money at that time and then our income has gone down and we added another child\nAnd we've gotten into a credit card debt and we had a ... now and we can take the money out there even back over the past three years without coffee surely you that are hitting me ... path that can leave that money and continue contributing to their\nPrepaid plan how much is in there\n[noise] um about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car\nWe have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards all five thousand\nOkay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nMe ... ... and that's and I realized when you get that they got out of order like having that Peter Pan ... play pan and then I don't like to get its point gotcha okay I'm\nIn your household income as one [noise] and my husband makes twenty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not cash would stop adding to it um and um you do need to get on a budget and policy with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency a no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college and a five twenty nine or an ESL and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you ... pay something your rate of return is what it increases\nIn price and so if I\nPrepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an increased rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply or saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now tuition for the last Seventy odd years as average about seven point two percent inflation right so\nThat means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent average annual return over that same period of time minded\nAnd so on you make more by putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but ... and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run\nAnd they grew up some of the prepaid college plans in the process I mean they're just horrible administrators now some states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration with a\nWith the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say I would roll your eyes you six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund\nAt some point right now I just stop adding get yourself on a budget crank your lifestyle down stopped going out to eat canceled the trip that you had planned called vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt\nSo you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent or want to thank you for ... for a a ... I was going to refuse for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen\nOr we were my family my parents have received an inheritance of mental\nA mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and fuel oil wells but not not a ... ... a speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom mhm and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly mhm\n[noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual um oil prices that sustain a drilling a and then that's the only reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon it was a boom by you know what I mean but are you doing and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on\nYou know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say uh I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all those at all or none\nNo it's not an all or none uh what's your which it's essentially a they're looking at a three million for all\nThe and or or you know obviously one point five perhaps\nOkay so you just heard it on my way\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking it as as women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling our house\nWe're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table to ship three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly\nBecause I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it that I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I think you know that you wouldn't know why and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know we're we're afraid the stock market crash yeah well\nIt might but I Am I going to start getting less\nRock markets less risk than growing holes yeah we're a hundred percent error that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just felt like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father making such\nOh I see so it's a just shut down they can make the decision for the whole thing or not\nYes All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you know if it struck out right after I sold it I don't regret it the rest of my life\nYou know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some\nMutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm\nSome advisers that have families entire portfolio three million dollar network be caught up in ...\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial so that they do that I Would say no\nI Would take the majority or all of that money off the\nThe news to have a blessing like that\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you in\nHeritage ... the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally an forever is with\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall met worse and so there are toy interest a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still have to do the maintenance on it and fool with it\nThen you know going in you know the the condo the other day we stopped in there we're going to get a condo over in Knoxville and when the ball game over there and the he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out so three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property\nThe more crap you own the more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally to go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big time investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHiring today how you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your life\nWhere they all get in the end of August I'm I have a friend\nWho has been

pay bills\nWhat that means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget\nWhere every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at your child support what it's going to be for this month before the month begins in you assign every dollar\nAnd so we would start with the top off the top you said your ... cool I'm not the first thing we do like ten percent off okay that tie this done now what are we gonna do next well we're going to eat\nThe second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your lights and your water okay then what's the next thing you do you do you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and lights and water

only man that much left those are food um but you know you probably got twelve hundred maybe not let's just call it a thousand you know after you just you run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus\n... minus ah my my uh food budget what am I set up for food and a minus ... minus my lights and water now I'm living now and I've eaten and the kids have eaten

our Web their colleagues\nNow let's listen back in the ... are on muted\nOr they were very momentarily waiting for that car final\nLike so often in the Senate it happens very very slowly what's gonna happen now for Brett Kavanaugh details are still being worked out but a White House official telling us today that the president will first have to sign a commission Kavanaugh can then be officially sworn in by another judge\nOr not the the vice president in this case\nThis could all happened by the end of today\nThere is likely going to be a ceremony I involving\nA the the actual swearing in some time down the road probably next week but I he will likely in a non ceremonial fashion at least to a lower degree lesser degree likely be sworn in maybe later today um by and\nNow there is a reminder joined guessing the galleries the finals on Russia's approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate gallery\nAre there any senators and the chamber who wish to vote or change your vote\n\nIf not on this vote the eyes or fifty the Naser forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is

much seen as a victory for President Trump for Republicans who pushed for Brett Kavanaugh for Democrats\nNot been somewhat of a defeat but at the same time I was very much an uphill battle or some could argue an impossible battle for them and then the place that they were in ... but it is now official fifty to forty eight the confirmation done we can assume that right now Brett Kavanaugh\nHas the news he has been listening to it he's been watching it I and it's probably up celebrating at this moment I Want to go now to ABC News political analyst Steve Roberts and Steve not to Asia here but you've been around for a long time you ever seen anything like this here today\n[noise] no I'm this is the closest vote or on a Supreme Court nominees since the Eighteen eighties and I was not around that and I'm and I'm\nA it's not just the closeness of the vote that is so striking um the two leaders Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell agreed on one thing a Schumer said this was a low moment for the Senate\nMcConnell said it was a dark chapter for the Senate they agreed on that except they blamed each other for that darkness and for that and that ... of uh uh that the Senate has sunk to the the anger the partisanship the lack of civility the lack of respect across the aisle\nOr Israeli reached a new low I've covered the Senate off and on for forty years and I have never seen\n'em this level of\nUm of animosity across party lines is a willingness to accuse the other side of the seat and deception and dishonesty\nUsually the Senate as at least of an ear of civility but that's been stripped away a and um it's partly because the stakes are so high\nUh if you look toward the fall election this um this vote today is going to be a major issue in the fall elections which are going to be very close both sides are going to be using this Alex the Democrats are going to be using this to stir up female votes\nA particularly college educated women in the suburbs where many of the key house races are going to be fought already even before the last week\nThere had been a sharp moving in that direction the sixty percent of white I'm college educated women opposed cabin on Fox poll before this all happened but at the same time uh Republicans are going to be using this to stir up a male votes\nUm the Democratic line as women are the victims here of sexual assault and the and the failure of the Senate to pay attention to their complaints the Republicans are going to say men are the victims here that's\nIt was the victims here they're the ones who could be accused falsely and uh and unfairly and those two rallying cries those to battle cries are going to be echoing for the next month um until election day Alex\nAnd see I Want to talk more about that in one moment I Want to jump quickly go to a somebody who was in the room ABC's Trish Turner she saw everything the just unfolded the protests that went on devoted self and Trish that tell us what it was like in that room\n[noise] hey Alex says so it's just\nNormally a very staid affair I've\nBeen through a lot of these um five different Supreme Court on nominations\nAnd I've seen nothing like this are really nothing like this since probably the Iraq War protests that happens but this was still I'm by far more emotional there were mostly women and men are up in the galleries where the public is allowed to set\nA before VP Pence the vice president and so as presiding I'm In the chamber as the chief presiding officer um and he was trying to call the vote\nAnd one lone woman at first stood and she said that you know I don't consent where's my representation she was yelling at first and then as the officers that search at arms are officers dragged her out\nShe was screaming it was really passionate I'd ... tried to keep going with a vote more women stowed and started yelling I you know they were almost out of a a ... of officers to grab these\nPeople to pull them out that men and women it was multiple I counted at least twenty by the time I walked out of the chamber they started voting on when Senator Collins out what's called to a vote she stood\nStarted to vote in a woman interrupted or a protester she said you know senator Collins you're a disgrace shame on you chew more women stood it was just a wave of\nProtesters threw the gallery and I would say that's um along side you know White House counsel Don McGahn he wasn't terribly far from where this happened Raj Shah deputy press secretary was also sitting there and the gallery um you know there were a couple of you know ah sections over um they could see all of this as well and all\nRape before the vice president's eyes he tried to gamble a number of times to get you know order and the chamber and I was really you normally don't see any\nAnything like this it was really something\n... Trish it seems like a you know almost his balloon that have been filled up for so long the pressure that we building now we look in on the chamber and people are just kinda casually talking some of laughter that boom it's over and that the the air has been laid out what happens now it sounds like that\nOr Kavanaugh will be sworn in in a non ceremony fashion tonight by another judge and then we're likely we'll see a ... a site and there's been a swearing in sometime next week\n[laughter] that's right um I Would expect or they they want to have him on the court on Tuesday and so I Would expect this to move in short order so he will be sworn in behind the scenes um chief justice John Roberts normally does this kind of thing we're not\nClear on what's going to happen just yet but this will be a quiet affair like you say at the Supreme Court and then there will be I Would imagine much fanfare when he is a goes\nTo his ceremonial swearing in a you know one has to think at the White House this is a very big moment for the president this is one of the key issues of you know the reason that so many conservatives I got behind\nHis nomination he promised conservative and that's what he has\nAppears to have delivered um you know so this is a very big moments and I keep saying you know this is a this is a huge issue that galvanizes the Republican votes normally not something that galvanizes Democrats\nBut absolutely as you all were just discussing it is something that has lit a fire it really remains to be seen there's very little time left in the terms you know this has bled out into the midterms and so it's effect\nWill have to measure in the days ahead but uh you know the house races certainly you know I could entirely turn on the passions of this moment or the Senate races are they're\nThey're all over the map you saw Joe mansion he's from a red state West Virginia you saw sold Democrat to vote yes he knows how are the politics are in his state of heat that's a very uh\n... you know if one were to say a smart political move on his behalf that one has to think that that's exactly what that was and uh and so we move forward from here and we see what the effect of this is a you know in the days ahead in the near term\nABC's ... Turner a who was inside the chamber today is all of this was going on just moments ago which we brought it to you alive\nWe were talking to Steve Roberts about the impact too and uh one of the the folks that they could feel the impact Lisa Murkowski I she ended up voting present to a way out to the Senate pair as it's\nWho's going to worry about if you let Matt take over his answers are in jail I can answer for him I was doing it for ten you know I Know that's fine and he never gets a chance to answer you know I'm asking you I really did know it'll be a long run began his tenure in this business is a long run\nI I don't I don't think I could have said ten years but I knew was going to be good because no one was going to work harder than us\nAnd the fact that okay so they teamed up ... they teams you or are they asked me\nYou don't have to do this but do you think it's a good idea and what did you said I said\nAnd then ... we went in the studio and for an hour he convinced me why this was going to be a good idea have you ever worked with a partner on the air before no no not not since college and that wasn't even a real radio show quote unquote I'd never worked with anybody\nSo you didn't have the same level of enthusiasm the gate has yet no no and it wasn't anything personal it was just you know do oh usually don't work out no and you have the advantage of course of having worked in this versus before\nWell yeah I mean I was about I don't know what I I don't think they've found gate or is that you that actually you had radio jobs before yes yeah and ... was a roofer so the out here [laughter] the idea of teeming the two of you of Wright was genius you're both East that was\nYeah that was not our decision that was the guy who hired\nYes and how does he feel about it now is he still hears he's not in radio for the shock laugh okay both east coast guys I Know about you of course growing up in the east coast going to University of Syracuse yeah\nAnd you went to every Catholic school where I Believe that existed in the yard and die city of Boulder Baltimore yes but we ever you're you're still your background was he covers oh yeah Maryland born and raised what was your first impression of Phoenix\nWhen you came in ah my first time or the first time I ever saw the city the first time you ever saw it was handled that mountain and it was Nineteen Ninety six I came out to visit my high school buddy Tony ... who moved here when he was Twenty years old you mentioned him just a little while ago on the air because he was invited to the party\nAnd [laughter] and\nHe was there he was and I try for ten years to get a job here\nI fell in love with this place immediately and it took ten eleven years to get here hey tell me where else you applied kiss kiss F.

and Katie a our news here with daemon Roberts and Matt Dayton I'm Jennifer Perry and as always if you have any questions for the guys just find us online at winning with money radio dot com or our team members are standing by during today's show to take any questions that you have for the guys off the air you can do that for eight zero\nSix to zero sixty nine o seven again that's for a zero six two zero six nine zero seven\nGuys I Know you love your job you been doing this for decades now I won't give away your age and it's okay to start the Saturday I don't want to get on your bad side already but unfortunately\nFor a lot of people today to or maybe this is a fortunate thing you move on to a bigger a better job actually today's baby boomers I think the average by the Labor Department is that we change jobs about twelve times during our careers and\nI Know you told us before here on the show that it could be a mistake to leave that four one K. behind when you do change jobs than actually personal finance website nerd while I kind of back this up recently to agree with you here but\nWhat usually recommend that people do when they leave their jobs should they keep their account there or should they roll it over and how complicated is that\nIt's not complicated but I think you definitely take the time to figure out what you have and what you should be doing with that money so we call these kind of the orphan for all one case\nAnd well we have an orphan right and what we find honestly as people will come in and it's funny they'll bring all their statements and then it's not uncommon that a day or two later they'll emails and say oh I forgot about this account\nAnd it's usually an old four O. one K. and what happens with these accounts is because you know you maybe wear a job for one or two years maybe it was early in your career\nMaybe you didn't build up that much wealth in this account what\nHappens is you know people ignore it they forget about it and they kinda just leave it on autopilot they don't go in and make adjustments to the portfolio and it's all of a sudden you pull it up later you find that you have too much risk or you pick an account that has a lot of these and you're kind of you know it's not performing well because you're not paying attention to it and so\nPeople pay attention to the bigger towns they pay attention to the counter either contributing to or the one that's the highest amount\nAnd so if you can take these older ... can consolidate them get him in one place number one it's easier to pick an investment strategy\nAnd number two you're going to pay attention to it more you're going to watch a little bit more you're going to take care of it\nAnd so when you have all these different orphan four O. one K. is what the other caller problem we see is that you'll pick these different funds inside of the four oh one K. and every four O. one K. has different phones you can pick from but when we run the analysis on the different accounts we find a lot of overlap ... find that\nMan this will this account that has a totally different name over here in this other four O. one K. is almost identical and its performance to the account you have in your current four one K. and so you find that you're not as diversified you're not spread out and so it leads to just some problems because you know it's difficult if not in one accountants\nWell it's not and want to count and so it's hard to know how well these are playing together and whether they're you know doing the right things and if your investment strategies aligned\nYou know yeah we run into this has not set all the time I had a guy come in just a couple of weeks ago who had four four oh one case\nComing in are now more technology savvy than they used to be mhm right and I like to make the analogy where we're talking about Google Maps everybody's got smartphones and if you're planning a vacation you're going to drive you're going to plug it in Google Maps right even if you're just driving to work or you're driving across town you're going to plug it in Google Maps and that Google Maps\nHere assuming quite a bit I was just on a vacation with my father in law [laughter]\nSmartphone literally like two or three years ago and he had never once open up Google\nMan have you know our work and I we were out we were back\nEast we're going from Washington DC up to Gettysburg and we rent a car as I said okay just follow me but if you get lost his follow your Google Maps will get you there and he's like what are you talking about\nWhat is the literally had to teach of that so in one trip my father in law learned how to do it over and he is like so proud of themselves and over and then he also now knows how to do Google Maps so not everybody follows and those with her smartphone is capable that's for sure [laughter]\nAll right well I Would venture to say that they all know that they need a roadmap yeah is that there may be legal to some preparation and the nice thing about\nThe new road map that we can do with Google Maps rather than go to AAA and have them you know right out and give you all the maps you're going to need and everything which by the time you get there might not be up to date Google Maps will tell us if there's traffic up ahead that will tell us if there's an accident\nIt will tell us multiple routes that we can go based on life happening right yeah and and that's kind of what Matt and I are doing all the time is we are helping people take something that's unknown\nTo help them take on something that's kind of scary and make it or something that's fun where they can dream where they can realize their goals and retirement and do it with peace of mind knowing that they've accounted for the different things that could come up yeah but\nIt almost sounds like you kind of reverse engineer that she talked to people about what their destination looks like what are there different concerns about retirement and then you get them back to that starting point and you say okay All right here's what you've saved and here's how we make this work because there is some truth in that\nAbsolutely you got to figure out what their goals and what they want to or have their retirement look like yeah where do you want to go and then you design it from there and so again someone walks in the office and they say you\nKnow I'm going to need X amount of dollars of income over and above what I what I Need from Social Security or going to create a plan different than someone walks in and says you know I have a pension and Social Security that covers everything I just need to have this invested so that I have some money\nThat when I have some discretionary spending items it's available and so every person's plan is different and like game of saying every single person's plan is going to have some adjustments and changes along the way there's going to be health issues there could be a potential death of a spouse\nBut that's where we get involved when we help you with that that's where we getting that information out here where we're sitting down and doing annually reviews and you're putting together\nThe plan at the beginning with the plan of I'm going to make some adjustments in two weeks to this but I've got a team to help me do that yeah and that's where people make the mistakes that they try to do it on their own and they make a mistake that they can recover from\nThe forces them to work longer or to have to make a drastic change in their lifestyle and so we strive to help people make those adjustments to avoid some of those big pitfalls so that they can contain enjoy the retirement they envisioned\nGlad you recognize that most of us need that road map or that Google Maps apt to help get us to retirement and that's the reason that you created actually a great starting point and that is the five steps to retirement cat so if you would like that kids give us a call today for the next ten callers\nWill make that available to you at no charge today it for eight zero six to zero sixty nine seven that's for eight zero six to zero sixty nine o seven and\nLet's face it guys I mean sometimes the hardest part is just getting some things on paper\nYou know we do some workshops at a nonprofit and at the very end you know we've given them an hour of of good information and and most of the people there are writing down furiously when we're telling about how they can go about claiming Social Security benefits and when they do to\nDo a rock and version and how they manage their funds so that they can avoid some of the big pitfalls retirement and the writing it's all down and when we get done with it you know I I tell them to stop writing and kind of look up and they say okay you know when the nonprofit the we volunteer for\nFirst started doing the workshops that he did their goal was to eliminate financial literacy and so they start educating teaching people and they thought they were making a difference but later they went back and they asked some of the people that came to the ...\nSome of the people that came to the workshops and they said what have you done with the information that you gain from the workshop you attended six months ago and the majority of the people I think we all know we're all thinking our heads with what the answer was and the answer is nothing yeah I Do human nature is we're going to write things down\nHuman nature is you're going to listen to the show and you can say oh yeah I Need to do that and so that made sense and all I Need to call them or I Need to do this and human nature is\nIs we don't do anything mhm so as a result any information that we gathered from reading a book or listening or trying to do some research on the Internet you know really provide zero benefit because it never got applied to our personal situation so\nWell we tell people is the first step\nIs actually coming into our office that's one of the critical steps because when you actually sit down with someone start that conversation with you and then a visor\nYou and your spouse and the advisor and we sit there and we start asking some of the questions and probing into kind of what you've done to prepare what your goals and wishes and aspirations are then that's the first step because now we're starting to get some of these things down on paper and from there we can then build and start putting that plan together but the first step\nIs picking up the phone and scheduling appointments and the first step is taking that step and sitting down and actually starting the conversation\nWill take that first step today give us a call for eight zero six to zero sixty nine o seven you can set up that first visit with him in a match in person and when you give us a call here during the break\nWell also send out to you the five steps to retirement kid it's a great way to get ... for that

one time right now how are you planning to protect that money from a market correction from taxes inflation and high fees\nIn case you missed it the key word there was playing because you really do need to have a retirement plan a comprehensive plan that shows how to invest for this next stage of life a plan that helps you take control of your taxes in retirement in a planet shows you how to get the best return but with the least possible risk\nYeah and that points out today man you know it really is an individual decision here based on the health of your pension fund based on your retirement goals too so that's why today here on winning with money if you have that kind of offer on the table from your employer if you'd like to go over your pension options with\nDaemon a match run through the different scenarios with them find out if you can do better outside that pension or\nDoes it make sense to actually stay with your pension fund you can give us a call for that pension review during the show today we're going to do that for ten callers at for eight zero six to zero sixty nine o seven again that's for a zero six two zero six nine zero seven\nThat guys I think the scary proposition about taking that lump sum is okay can I get the growth that I still need can I Do better but what options do you have if you do take that lump sum and how do you help people get the most out of those retirement dollars over the course of their retirements\nWhile I was saying because of the recent uh laws were passed it's twenty five percent more expensive in what the companies are having to pay into that pension guarantee fund and so a lot of the lump sum options are becoming more and more attractive before it was like oh my gosh\nThis lump sum is so low there is no way I Would take I'm going to take the monthly amount now they're getting a lot more attractive really you have to then figure out okay when am I going to trigger this income\nAnd what potentially could I Do with this money to grow it what vehicle am I going to choose so when you take the lump sum again as you if you rolled out into an area count\nThan it remains tax deferred so that's usually what people's first question is I don't want to pay a bunch of taxes and so that's how you can avoid that\nThen once you put it into the IRA now you get to choose your investments and typically people are choosing between two different strategies one they're going to put it into an investment portfolio where they're trying to pick\nYou know stocks or ATF for mutual funds\nTo grow those funds there's risk with that there's also the potential of getting you know double digit type returns and then a lot of people are also considering a new witty and so some people will say okay well why would I allocate money to an annuity because you know the problem with the pension is that is going to disappear if I die if I put money into an annuity\nThan when I die it's going to disappear and that and that's a fact that people misunderstand huh most annuity today you still have control where you can take out up to ten percent each year and then at the end of the contract on an annuity which is usually you know eight to twelve years long\nYou can take the lump sum if you pass away and you're taking income from it and there's money left over that can pass as a death benefit\nAnd so a lot of times when we crunched the numbers if we have two or three years where people don't need to start taking that money that you can grow that lump sum oftentimes an annuity will produce just the same amount of income as the pension was going to offer but the big differences now you have control of those dollars if you needed to take a little bit more you could do that\nIf you passed away early and there was a bunch of money left over that still passes here beneficiaries so a lot of people are looking at that and saying man I now have control over my money\nI get to pick how has invested likely I'm going to have really close to the same amount of income\nAnd man if I pass away or something else happens or I Need to take his lumps Sommer going for a nursing home and I need all the money at once I've got control over that and I can do that you know people are saying man this looks pretty good so those are the kind of things that you have to look at kind of pay attention to and as you're making your decision of what you do it that pension\nIt's good to know guys that there are some options especially with more headlines about some of these troubled pensions out there but\nIf you'd like to find out what options makes sense for you\nGive us a call during the break here be one of those callers today to come in for that complimentary pension review with Damon ... at for eight zero six to zero

week guys we get a lot of calls and questions from our listeners here about their specific retirement concerns and it's why each week we like to feature a case study some of your actual clients\nWho are already walking through that planning process because I think it shows people you're not alone in your concerns about retire mentioned a couple that we're talking about today here actually market Sarah they're still working not yet ready to retire writes\nYeah they're thinking they want to retire in two years and so you know we changed their name so no one can say hey I heard\nThem talking about young marine I'm\nMark works for a small company he's worked there for quite a while but he had worked for a bigger company before and had\nSome other money saved up and saw Sarah she works for a bank and what was interesting as her bank offers you know investment advice and and she kind of seen some of the clients coming in and out and kind of her the advice and she didn't really have any interest in talking to the advisors that are owned\nBy a vote that will telling we want to say what [laughter]\nSo mark had hurt us on the radio and so they came in between the two of them then about a hundred thousand a year and they're spending about sixty they're trying to contribute into their four oh one case uh she's getting a match on hers\nAnd so they're doing a good job saving their living below their means but you know they're kind of saying okay when we retire we still want to have that sixty thousand dollars now the reason that that's the case that they're hoping to have their house paid off at that time and what their thought as as hate us extra money that we're going to be freed up put what we're paying towards the mortgage\nWe want to use that kind of are fun money that's going to be our travel we've got more time and we want to be able to do some of the fun things and so they're thinking they need to still keep their income about the same and so that was their big concern is how do we replace her paycheck how do we make sure that we can have enough money and what we don't run out and then we got a plan in place\nSo the first thing we looked at when we're talking\nThis is okay you know you both been working what is the Social Security benefits look like and if they retire and a couple of years like they're planning his benefit would be about twenty three hundred and Hearst would be about Seventeen hundred\nSo right there you know you do a little math or and they've already got about four thousand dollars a month coming in\nFrom Social Security and again they're wanting to have about sixty thousand dollars after taxes so they're close you know they only need about twenty twenty five thousand dollars and they'd be able to cover taxes and still have sixty thousand dollars\nAnd so you know the key is how do we covered that twenty five thousand dollar gap that they're going to have how do we make sure that we have a plan for increasing costs so they can get some cost of living adjustments along the way\nAnd how do we maximize their returns but then reduced how much Uncle Sam is going to take those are the the main issues that we wanted to focus on\nAnd so Sarah has a small pension she was trying to decide if she should take a lump sum with that\nOr take a monthly pay out because again the monthly pay out would be guaranteed for life that'd be another income stream and so what do we do with that and so those are their main questions and concerns when they came in kind of a typical situation again you know people aren't trying to answer the same question of how to write it replaced my paycheck and so that's where we kind of started with them\nAnd with march listening to the radio show you know they did come in and want to know what are they paying fees because like a lot of people most their dollars we're in for one k.'s and\nAll they could see was the expense ratio is on the prospect is about ... you know wanted to know what what else is there what do we really paying and fees and and like a lot of people lately they were they're pretty happy with what's been going on\nRight right the market [laughter] the market's been good but they also know that that's not going to go on forever and so there are a little bit worried about you know do we have\nToo much risk and you know Sarah did have this question about the pension and one of the things we had to look out with that was you know under funding of pension is a real thing there's some really large pensions in our country that are in trouble and so we needed to look at that and looked at this\nThat and look at the stability of her pension also how dependent are they on that pension immediately you know Matt just mentioned that just with their Social Security they're going to be really close to having all the income they would need\nAnd and so we we needed to look at how dependent they were on that pension that helps and factory and whether we use it an hour later and then or take the lump sum how flexible they could be and so and and looking at", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "year": "2018", "city":
