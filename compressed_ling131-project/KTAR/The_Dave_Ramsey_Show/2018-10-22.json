in the program how are ya\nI'm doing great agent and you're doing well I trust doing\nVery well thank you very much and you know I was I was thinking about the show the other day have you ever been in a hurry when you're traveling somewhere new and then you run into road construction and and you have to make a sudden detour or something at this happened as the other day and it just made me think of some of the topics that we talk about\nBecause sometimes you can get on track pretty quickly but sometimes you're just watching that little thing on your GPS just rerouting re calculating route what do they say re calculating route recalculate ing route and she's\nTrying to tell you to keep making U turns or something have you have your\nOwn way yeah oh yeah yeah I I think\nThis happen to us when we were in Colorado last year and and this is the girls trip it was my daughter and some of her friends and some other moms is is when we went to hike the mountain so we're trying to get out of town\nAnd the yeah the GPS just kept telling us to go all these places and we and we kept running into these one way streets and we could not get the direction that when you want to go and it was\nIt was so frustrating Phyllis I didn't think we were ever going to get out of that town\nAnd the same thing can happen with our journey to retirement you know we've been working so long for so many decades to build up the next day we've made so many right turns so far but it's so easy to make a wrong turn and you just have this frustration building because you can't get back on track\nFinancially I I'm sure you've seen this happen before\nOh absolutely and and the the big thing about this and of course we talk about this all the time\nPlenty for retirement ... you know getting to and through return what you do then is so much different than when you're\nJust really starting up the cumulative for retirement the recipe or you know using your analogy um the directions just change and I don't think people scream it from the rooftops loud enough that\nEverything you've dug up to this point has to you have to think about it differently so that's why sometimes people are focusing on focusing on focusing I'm saving them sued him saving a\nBuilt the number built the number built the number and a blues not working uh oh\nYeah because there's just so many different things that that you need to to focus on at this stage of life and we call that the retirement originally when you were within five to ten years of retirement or just retired you're within you know\nFive or ten years of being retired this was a certain period of time where you've got to look at things entirely different turn your life upside though get new directions make sure the GPS is set for this stage of life\nRight and and there's so much more to retirement planning than just picking the right investment fill up I think you're right people they've been\nRight and and there's so much more to retirement planning than just picking the right investment fill up I think you're right people they've been in the accumulation phase for so long they been focused on growing\nTheir nest egg and saving but there's more to it than just making the right stock picks are making the right decisions with your investments\nCan you talk about some of the strategies that we can use so we don't

P. S. P. N. associates and we recently saw a precipitous drop on Wall street if you're like most investors nearing retirement you might be wondering how this is going to impact you my colleague Megan ... had the chance to sit down with financial educator and New York times best selling author David Baake\nFor and insightful conversation about what this volatility means for you and retirement\nLet's listen in\nOctober tenth saw the worst day for the Dow since February a big drop in popular tech stocks put an impact will sell off in motion so what does this mean for you your finances and most importantly your retirement\nDavid by a well known financial educator it's here to make sense of what's happening on Wall street and David been featured on Fox CBS CNBC the today show and Oprah\nDavid been out there teaching America about money for more than two decades he's at nine time New York times best selling author of books including smart couples finish rich and smart women finish rich and today he's co founder of H E wealth management one of America's fastest growing our eye gaze\nDavid welcome we are thrilled to have you with us\nThanks Rob let's\nOne of America's fastest growing ... David wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today Thanks for having me on the show let's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what smart this sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all on and so the question becomes all is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a handful things\nThe first thing is that rates are going up and you even heard the president talking about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates the fed the actually been raising rates really since two thousand and Fifteen but\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money that things can lend they called the Federal Reserve fund rate to tour record happened in September and\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes right so you're going to borrow money for a home\nIf you're going to refinance your home if you're going to buy a car and you're gonna financed that car or you're going to use credit cards for that matter any where where you're borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and\nThat's ... ... spoke some market right because if you're\nHome maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance or home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less when\nIt costs more to borrow money the markets kicking stoop to that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about the fed and rates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because\nLet's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historical rate which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective\nUm and they're all some other things that are happening that are influencing the stock market which is as rates have gone up\nThe tenure treasury the rates have gone up on that right now and that's the highest rates we've seen on ten year treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happening and then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't ... let me see that\nWe've seen a sell off in tech stock protect really kept stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches\nWith companies involved like Amazon a potentially data breach and Facebook's had a recent data breach and so there's been some soften these tech stocks but again\nMaking putting that in perspective it's been the tech stocks have been driving the market higher company and we call them saying companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google use main tech companies\nHave been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks have been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit um it's not that surprising and it was probably you know about time for us to see tax Sox pull back and\nI think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that trade wars um\nAll this talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally the global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been absolutely crushing it we've had the best stock market in the world um\nAnd so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um there's really been a lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down\nAnd we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a pre there to an almost a recognized that things are slowing down globally\nBecause of the fear of these trade wars with China\nEven I Want to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can sell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates really liberal retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees a special retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan\nAnd you're probably not using credit card or to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher is that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries\nAre going higher and at the end most retirees live off of the income that their retirement money produces so the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will\nYou live off of income got their retirement money produce\nSo the good news and I think actually it like for you know we will see tenure treasury over three and a quarter even three and a half percent and there's talk at\nThe tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next day and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of the income so I think it is\nA retiree it can actually be a very odd\nMid fantastic insights on this market drop what the silver lining here and all of this\nWell I think the silver lining is how incredible and economy we have right now like let's not leave side of you know look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years unemployment is at three point seven percent right now\nIt you look at what they have and and you think otherwise what is it that people have that that's not bad\nIt's let's think about it like this I Know you like to cook too yes so let's think about the\nDifference between a grocery list and a real recipe most people coming into me have that grocery list they've cut all the ingredients\nBut they don't have a recipe and you know I mean maybe I don't know 'cause I'm a I'm not necessarily always the greatest right on you know that you could have all the writing radiance but if you don't have\nThe the recipe and you don't know the quantity and you don't know the order you really can mess up that happy right so most people come in with a grocery\nList they got stuff here they got stuck there they've got stuck there but they don't know how to make a recipe out of it that's what we say they've got stuff they've got stocks they've got bombs they've got CDs they've got you know a pension over here they've got a four O. one K. over there\nAll scattered and and they look at the number how much they've accumulated\nAnd they say I got this but they really don't have a recipe\nThat I really don't have a recipe\nOkay so so what you're able to do then and what your retire fit analysis does sell us it's helped but figure out first of all what we're trying to make to say that the recipe right that's\nExactly it that that would be you know what we're trying to make it is you know what's the plan what's budget right and then once we have\nIdea of what are our goals in retirement than we start defining what that recipe looks like how much do we need you know of an income\nHow much do we need of emergency how much do we need for for middle growth if you will how much do we need for long term growth we we kind of defined that like the building your fiscal dream house when you build a house what's the strongest part\nOf it to the foundation that phone yup the foundation so in retirement some of that money's going to be the foundation\nWhich is your long term money your cash flow money your cash flow your retirement income that you need coming in till death do you part sometimes people are really surprised how long it will take to just get through those goals but I don't rush it it's so important we have to have that\nAnd to get started on building that fiscal house you can call fill us in the teen at the SPN associates today six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again that six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six will continue\nTalking about how to get that plan in place build that fiscal dream house on the other side of the break the final segment of retire financially cells returns after that [noise]\nWhen it comes to your health it's clear you consult your doctor\nSo why not

retire financially fit with Phyllis I'm generally that pleased to be here alongside Phyllis ... she's founder and president of the SPN associates retire with the S. P. dot com is the website if you'd like\nTo learn a little bit more we're talking about some of the components to having a true plan and one of the ways Phyllis explained this to me earlier was\nHaving a a recipe a true recipe versus a grocery list another way we can talk about this Phyllis is building that fiscal house where we want to start with the strongest piece of this where we want that strong foundation\nAnd then we build it up from there but I think the bottom line is Phyllis you have to have a plan as you get into retirement we're not going to be\nAs successful if we're just winging it that's that's why we talk about the plan Phyllis so when we have times of increased volatility we don't have to worry we have this plan in place right\nAbsolutely that that is essential at this stage that's that's one of my phone does not ringing off the hook when we go into some market volatility because we have a plan we know that foundation that cash flow is coming from so we're not paying\n... because in Phyllis that's that's not what anybody wants to be panicked when they have\nVolatility we want that assurance that things are okay because\nIt still is the way you set up these plans is the money that's at risk we can't afford for that money to be at risk we don't have everything at risk that that's one of the main component or one of the main things we think about how we're structuring this and we're starting\nWith that foundation right that's that's the part that is not at risk ... we're putting the risks somewhere else in the house\nThat's exactly right again to go back to the analogy stuff that we have to count on we want relatively low risk that foundation look you wouldn't ... your paycheck\nRight when we get to the walls will yeah we have a little wiggle room right because our bills are getting paid the roof or long term money okay it's like you know the roof and many times have you had to replace shingles on your roof\nI mean a few times but not not you\nIt's exposed to the illness right long term and you know the money up in the roof is is that money that you don't necessarily have to count on in the short term friend you know it's going to be a little bit more risque but if we have time on a side with good with it\nBut we're not going to replace the\nFoundation and our house on a regular lately the right way to lose or draw wouldn't lose or draw I don't\nKnow many people over the years we've ever replaced a foundation on their house\nBoy yeah yeah some repairs to it but you're not turn out that whole thing hopefully boy hopefully oh gosh well\nYou know when we talk about having a plan fellows here's here's something that I notice you and I both are runners here a better runner than me I'm obviously um but my daughter is a runner also and when she first started showing up at her meats and that her races\nShe just show up and run and do our best and try to keep up with everybody else and hope she beat somebody right ... that's kind of how she was looking at this for a while we got her a watch though so she could start tracking her pace and she could start paying attention\nTo how fast she was going or how fast she needed to be going and once she had that tool to help her monitor her pace fill us\nThat's when she started winning medals that's when she started getting a a little bit more competitive\nI think when we talk about having this income plan for retirement it's the same thing rather than showing up in retirement doing the best we can and hoping we're going to beat somebody are hoping we're going to be All right until the end\nWere armed with a tool that will help us make sure and give us the confidence to know here's what I Need to be doing now so I can do this the right way is that how we should be thinking about this will\nSay I can't tell you how many people come in it and they're actually\nAfraid to share the numbers or to get the plan because they thought they think it's so overwhelming I don't know where to START I don't know what it means but yet once we go through the process and we break it down into bite sized pieces\nAnd they understand where they want to go and they understand how they can get there and they have something to track it versus just how the stock market did today\nYou know or just one barometer just that's willy nilly\nThey really get confidence in retirement what what really\nYou know or just one barometer to that's willy nilly they really get confidence in retirement what what really gets me up in the morning get three in the work is the excitement about helping people through that process so that they have that watch that they can refer to and know where they need to go and stay on track\nThat's exactly what the retire fit analysis does for people it puts you in charge it gives you something to track to stay on target and you know it all starts with being one of the first ten calls if you've worked hard

and that you won't have any health issues make sure that you have a plan in place that proactive versus reacted\nYou're probably much better off than you think once we understand everything it's not rocket science we can sit down and break it down into bite sized pieces put you in charge of it\nGet a plan in front of you so that you have so much more probability of success and you enjoy it a lot more rather than worrying about what's actually happening which you you know what you don't know that you should know starts picking up the phone\nBeing one of the first and goes and calling us it's

a fat or a well\nPublicized in recent Arizona Republic newspapers report major report a conductor by your organization which has been all over the papers here for for the last several weeks\nI I Want to start though and ask you about this organization I I I went to the website I looked at it and uh I I saw a well representation of some serious Silicon Valley money behind this [noise] [noise]\nYeah we were founded by leaders in the business end tech community and as a bipartisan political organization committed to reform in America has broken immigration and criminal justice system so we try to find at commonsense bipartisan solutions to these problems that will help our economy so\nWhat is the extent of involvement of who tell us about who so I I I ... I recognize up soccer Burke who are some of the other folks involved\n[noise] hit number of 'em at tech leaders who helped found dead at this point we're primarily and funded through the channels are back in ... as an ... and his wife\nI see and I said well we'll tell us a you know a moving onto onto the report ah I'm noticing that uh you know the leaders pretty striking a we know that the population a prison population has a founded a all over the last four years\nBut Arizona's even an outlier compared to this trend\n[laughter] that's right Arizona's ... population has grown by at ... am\nMultiple of twelve or in the last forty years all the rest of the country has gone by multiple for so Arizona's grind three times as fast as the rest of the country and what we found and they're part of that ad that's not due to the underlying population growth Athens teeth out than Arizona's\nA prison population that's about twice as fast as it has it in population and and it's not due to crime which is down significantly over that same Kerry and\nWell I can speak to this specifically because that for a year a timeframe coincides almost precisely with my own time in Arizona\nAnd in the early Nineteen eighties there was a quote unquote a criminal justice reform headed by a fellow named Steve twist to his assistant attorney general of Arizona they\nMassively increase sentencing live in ... length of sentences imposed mandatory sentences and the light put severe restrictions on judicial description on judicial discussion\nAnd a ... you could see where that just thinking of the arithmetic of it that it was a long term ticking time bomb because if you take somebody who's getting a ten year sentence for something and you make it twenty you've had no impact on the prison population for the first ten years but\nBecause if you take somebody who's getting a junior sentence for something and you make it twenty you've had no impact on the prison population for the first ten years but starting in your eleven and in the out years you start to\nYou start to have an exponential growth unless you do something to change that and they look at the curve of what's happening with our prison population that conforms to that almost precisely\nAnd the real stories that may not be what they see on the headlights that go oh there's more underneath this this is a bigger problem and these are people that are are suffering from from the impacts of all of this\nOr at least one of your meetings this this go round is actually in a person has enough\nYes so we were out at Lewis prison I'm a ... last week at ten days ago and\nI inside the prison and working with the people in the new just a second chance programs so they were probably there were five to six of prisoners due to ... to be released a shortly that Saturday staple in disgust with people that their issues and they're concerned\nIt's a far cry used to be with you you just went up to the Grand Canyon isolated yourself from the world is a little more hands on and so a tone you you've read their research reports for for ... ... what's your what's your biggest as a citizen were in your job your background\nThis was not professional your your background is as an educator\nUh from from the standpoint of a an both citizen what your big trade with\nUm the big takeaway is that this is a social problem there are so many aspects to this that we've tried to to criminalize it all but in fact\nAs one of a prisoner once told me that you know we try to talk about rehabilitating\n'em me but I was never ability did we have so many issues that lead into prison people into prison I'm that we're not we're not resolving and the majority of people are almost probably Seventy five percent a show that they have some drug and alcohol problem\nOr ... you look at the figures Yusuf drugs everywhere\nAnd then you have mental health issues are probably overlap that as well so why why are they in prison and the ... you know what are we doing about those issues\nUm uh so that it's just a very complex problem but it certainly is a social problem that touches everyone really one way or another it costs us a lot of money [laughter]\nOr let me one of our biggest finding for for um the reporter was that the number of people going in just for drug possession had at crown by a hundred and forty two percent since two thousand so thirty five hundred people I'm off going every year and that's definitely the kind of thing you know\nWe know that those people can be treated safely ... and more effectively in a community a\nWireless locking them up pride Dixon right\nOne of the things that struck moon your report that just jumps out in terms of Arizona as an outlier\nIs that in this may surprise people love the fifty states Arizona is number four in terms of road of incarceration in a chart in your report shows we're\nBeaten by Mississippi Louisiana and some state\nUh unnamed on your chart so it should be Oklahoma [laughter] ah what's\nThe fix here if if it's if it's so much drugs you know the drug rehabilitation programs are notoriously unsuccessful\nOr what's the fix if the if you're if if people are in in prison for our big big numbers are in prison for drug related things what's ... what's the alternative\nWell there are programs that can work and and other states have um reinvest that money and community treatment for we know is that treatment in prison and doesn't really work because when people get out there still subjected to their triggers 'em and they're not\nHaving the same impact as if they were able to be treated\nIn their community where they kind of work through all of that at the same time um people can't afford treatment and so what you do need to ah find some way to to re invest money in that but it's cheaper than prison um so uh oh what a lot of states have done five states now have actually made it so that Dr possessions not a\nFelony anymore I'm so it can't be subject to a prison sentence and have 'em reinvest at the the man's from their prison populations\nInto a at the community to try and help with that um addiction and mental health treatment\nI Wonder you know prison served multiple functions and or one of the functions which people who are engaged in this\nI I Wonder you know prison served multiple functions and or one of the functions which people who are engaged in this recognizes rehabilitation punishment is also a function and ah doesn't make it more difficult to garner public support for change when\nWhen anything other than prison gets interpreted as you I'm sure I'm sure you've heard the phrase you know you're being quote soft on crime [noise]\nYeah I a lot of um tape have have dealt with us and what's interesting is now a movement really from the right I think a lot of conservatives have started talking about being smart\nOn crime shows I had a bigger question at the end of heartbreak coming up but I Will let you pick up when we return in just a moment in the ...

listening for any amount of time you know my secret I exercise watch what I eat and I maintain my health with weekly visits to the joint I've been going through the joint for eight years and there's a simple reason why the joints mission is to improve the quality of your life\nBrought some of that reality and understanding into different communities that hadn't experienced it before um and we are as a country trying to respond differently to that and and treating it more as a harm reduction issue as a public health issue um that as a criminal justice issue and the governor here in Arizona has\nA lead the way I'm not I'm a pastor big bill last year that\nI did not increase penalties that actually provided help and resources for people uh there was a bill that tried to increase penalties for people selling a narcotics um which we don't think that would help or work um and luckily it was defeated um but so that idea that you can\nBe just tougher on on crime and get out of something like that is still out there in Arizona but I think I'm\nPoliticians are are starting to see that there are better ways to handle these issues\nUm and hopefully they can I bring that mindset to the folks who are already incarcerated and for other kinds of crimes\nAre I think that's one of the areas where there's also a lot of misunderstanding ... you mentioned or you know showing are crowded that sounds good you're debris conjures up\nAnd injure an image of big time dealers but in fact most of the people who get tried for selling narcotics or themselves user and they're showing small amounts to people around them to support their own personal habits that that's quite differently the image of a big time drug dealer\nRight and taking those people off the street and locking them up for a long time doesn't do anything to reduce the availability of drugs and the community you have to address it ferment demand side is what the research shows that person's just going to be replaced someone else's guy um be at the veto be selling and supporting their own habit um\nSo we're just essentially wasting time by locking up person up\nAh but the question is how you read it to reduce demand\nThat's a difficult question I'm and I think it's a public health question and it's unfortunately one I don't have a an answer for about what we know is that what we've been trying that punitive approach has not worked no\nRoe deer were were ... I think that's the essence of it we're taking a a public issue and trying to make it a criminal justice issue and uh we've been doing that for forty years or has worked out so well\n[noise] there's so many areas that can provide support and help in the beginning if we look at this they're rescinding some task force that the government does have\nIt and process right now I I work with folks in that taste too and I see so many elements that needs to happen um it's not just any one simple thing I'm at it as an example we got people coming in and got people coming out but it would be able to deal with the ones coming out and so that they don't return\nIt's jobs it's housing it's\nA family support it's a simple things you just like um where how ... how do I do function in the world that now has computers and I did and it didn't have a cell phone when I went in so when we look at it as a social issue and a sense of taking care of a wrap around\nTo look at the issues and help that person um succeed\nThen we can't help but look back also and see what got them in there and work could we have done those things to even keep them from being in\nSo looking at it as as it it truly is a big social I I'm societal issue at at um will will work at two to arrive there and you're right there there's sometimes we need to say well follow the money if you wonder about why or how we've gotten where we are\nSpeaking of follow the money this was a rep on this ... when we return among other things I Want to talk about ... private prisons in the role of that kinda money your thoughts on that when we return for a final segment on prison\nOr in among other things I Want to talk about private private prisons in the role of that kinda money your thoughts on that when we return for a final segment on prison reform in the think tank\nMy mom was guiding light light that some ... wearing bell bottoms under a discount bomb [noise] I Know mom wouldn't want us to cry now she'd want us to dance\nWith me we all want to be ready for that\nThe gardens and oriole park and funeral ... or any of his I'm cooking anymore and provider asking\nHow they get big ... big money memorial life ...\nAnd I still can't believe on these cardinals road trips that they won't let me carry on my best mattress ever apparently they haven't gone to Brooklyn betting because when you go to Brooklyn buddy when the finish\nLine every night is the portable luxury from Brooklyn betting well how do they do it from Brooklyn buddy mattresses are made right here in Arizona they own our sleep solution because they own the factory right on ... it's our home field advantage they pass\nThe savings on to us at all the valley locations and online at Brooklyn betting dot com and then they take our real time feedback and they just created the all new boom hybrid you want all natural comfort\nWe get it with the all new bloom hybrid naturally cultivated comfort with superior pressure point relief individually in case coiled certified organic cotton and then you know what else do we get\n... percent off when you use the code Paul that's rights won ... percent off all mattresses when you use the code Paul at checkout outline any of our location and remember at Brooklyn buddy you order your mattress by three get delivered today free [noise]\nAre you calling him a R. dot com\nWe are discussing prisons prison reform or Arizona town hall topic of uh\nOf the year Bethany land back to or from Arizona town hall was here and on the phone we have Felicity road she is with a forward us and I know her among other things to be ever true so uh [noise]\nSo I Believe what she says so um I Want to start and read you a a a quote that uh is relates to the politics of some of criminal justice reform\nOr criminal justice related issues or John ... Nixon's chief domestic advisor or later did jail time for Watergate related crimes it was the top domestic advisor for Richard Nixon and I quote\nThe Nixon campaign in Nineteen sixty eight in the Nixon White House after that had to enemies the antiwar left and black people\nHe continued you understand what I'm saying we knew we couldn't make it illegal to either against the war or black but getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily we could dirt disrupt those communities he said\nWe could uh rest of their leaders raid their homes break up their meetings and vilify them all night or on the evening news\nDid we know we were lying about the drugs of course we did\nA politics gets\nInvolved in this do who gets who gets prosecuted and who gets a who gets diverted 'em\n... how much uh I\nI Do want to get to the issue because I said I Would the profit motive private prison a solicitor you have any any thoughts on that [noise]\nYeah it's a huge problem the racial disparities in the system and actually I'm Deborah part we put out with the only part one of the rings and our next report well look at that a lot more deeply into that I'm into how different communities and Arizona are affected that\nBased on ethnic communities and also look at county to county disparities on end at how different parts of the state might treat people differently\nInteresting it will be ultimately contrast maybe maybe it's racial or maybe it's that we will learn something\nBut uh the heroin business in the sixties seventies had heavy ratio black overtones but methamphetamine team seems to be mostly uh not exclusively but a large part of it seems to be white in rural so different constituencies\n\nYeah drinking that does not really a very too much by race varies as the type of ... that people use 'em and then often the punishment for that drives Mary's at based on who is the thing that all all of that at the federal level\nCrack cocaine versus powder cocaine same stuff crack cocaine was associated with blacks in the inner city and got heavily heavily sanctioned a powder cocaine same stuff\nOf crack cocaine was associated with blacks in the inner city and got heavily heavily sanctioned a powder cocaine same stuff uh tended to be white affluent users and was a comparatively light sentences exactly\nSo talk about I Wonder the whole issue of discretion and a lot of these uh uh you know crackdown programs uh were were\nLabeled as quote troops in sentencing but what they ended up being is mandatory minimums in Arizona I think the requirement was whatever their stated a\nStated a penalty was you had to get ... you had to serve eighty five\nPercent of that I'm Talking about that in terms of of the way presidents around and how judges feel about that\nYes so Arizona is one of only three states in the country that still requires everybody goes to prison to serve eighty five percent of their sense behind bars and the result of that is that people in Arizona bend\nTwice as long in prison as a national average for non violent crimes for property crimes for drug possession um which again it as we talked about before not a great use of resources and the other thing that means is they don't have an incentive to participate in programs while incarcerated and not makes\nSo is that equals up to three weeks that you are doing what you set out to do and the first place how much business are you missing out on all for what to be stressed out every quarter and still uncertain on whether or not you're doing the right\nPeople hire you for an expertise scale and you need to hire people who have skills in the areas that you don't\nAnd unless you have the training attacks professional needs to be the one managing your tax returns and your book keeping\nOur tax endorsed local providers can help you get back to the work you love\nAnd grow your business find on there are you a day Ramsey dot com slash E.

just wanted to give you all back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here so ah you feel a place for that kind of getting used to everything\nBut uh uh I'm currently unemployed I was just like go uh no past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now I I'm an accountant and my life as a teacher she teaches special education [noise] um so she currently has a job um my question is we are living with her parents um for the time being until probably maybe next summer so until we can buy or on house\nUm we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student debt left between both of us and we've got about that that much in our bank account right now I'm I wasn't sure obviously once they find a job\nIf the best strategy will be to try to knock that get out as soon as possible and then from there started to stay for a house or what my wife kind of want to do is just put everything we can toward a down payment to try to you know hopefully not pay for your mind get close to that twenty percent of course I didn't know\nWhat your take was and I mean it seems like we should still be able to have some sort of decent downpayment either way I just didn't know um how you would feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buy a home when they're broke\nBecause he'll make your broker that's why they call a

it's not real popular advice and your wife's not like it so you might not do it but my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\nAnd save an emergency phone up three to six months of expenses above that save your down payment and then by you know when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergence\nAbove that save your down payment and then by and when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar stealing your emergency fund after you move in and you have no payments but the house payment that houses

is a type of cash value policy\nA portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs and the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rage and show more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investment\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon in her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to investments\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just said all correct Sharon\nYeah yeah okay and what is going to face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and how much money do you all have\nHow much money that we have from\nYou how much you and your for one k.'s and your daily so\nWe we did have a retirement account how much they pay total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a ... dollar mark and finally I got ... I have to pay for good hello [laughter] kind of like\nSo you don't have to watch as cash value is in this\nHow about you know OK so and you have a pension plans as well yeah okay\nAnd so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works his guy he um have thirty six thousand and income ... any advice and Twenty one and then ... and that's all I I don't know I\nGot you in the face of amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars\nYeah okay we did look into turning Sharon for him but number one it really a lot of aid but number two he has to answer a couple of times yeah\nNon Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically you know it was like yeah very difficult very difficult and we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year\nIf I don't know how much of a having a month yeah okay\nAll right so eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise]\nUm\nWell here's here's the equation and here's the way it works in your mind okay what's the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty\nThousand dollars if he dies before you do okay\nAnd so is that worth a hundred bucks at this stage it's there's no investment value whatsoever so we're not going to the only question is you know you you don't have a huge nest egg a you you've got a small mistake and the show to double it basically\nIf he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nAnd they told us that would only last three or four years anyway and they sent me want to make it\nOkay and they're going to make you stop any way they are going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you would catch it out and whatever cash value isn't there a\nVan and [laughter] I have met would like to get it out now\nYou know one way to get it out in one way to get out now is closed policy down\nRight which when they're good at\nWhich which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money it paid for how somebody living on Social Security right yeah but you probably could make it goes I gotta feeling you guys were frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true\nUm\n[noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are are are I'm sure I Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they are going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I ... well no I guess if we can pay\nWe're doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer OK I asked him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it\nUm ah\nMy tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while\nOkay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month\nEven if you use the cash values you can have the cash value to begin to pay the premium\n... and\n... you know it's going to do is going to use up some of the eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that\nAnd let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nAnd close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then I was his health how um the first time we went to a good faith cancer free for five years and that kind of a cancer free for two years good\nOh I think okay I didn't get a and every every six months of how to make sure it's not coming back and got some\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going of that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open if he if he's being if the cancers come back at any stage right you keep you keep the thing open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen the spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to me it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured so\nYeah you know but um but but you're also not paying\nYou know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what it's going to be at that point yeah\nWhich is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into a investments to start having some money\nAnd um but but at this stage ... I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's\nIt's obviously a bad policy so I'll be in a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with this now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years but the cash value pay at at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if ... if he's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem folks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance will live life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just experienced it\nYour six parents the back end what happens if you\nBuy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens is because the money they put into that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if they put it into that in a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. they'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir house is paid for she wouldn't even called

getting out of that is\n[noise] being diligent went there and staying on track yeah even when you see when you grew up I mean I can be the one that would be the most is all my idea but what I Want something or I like stuff so [laughter] I always like the most expensive thing\nAnd I don't want to put the biggest fuss about waiting or you know being patient the hardest thing\nNo well you did it

millionaire land and be outrageously generous along the way okay that's the only who\nAre I Robert analysis in Hartford, Connecticut two hundred and sixty one thousand dollars paid off that's their house and everything but I was thirty two years old seven and a half years it took them making eighty to two hundred a year counted down let's zero three scream\nI boy those go\nWell then you guys very very well\nDone I Love it\nSarah is with us in Ann Arbor Michigan and he said Ron how're you\nI'm great thanks for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] so I have a question\nAbout um some of the movement tree the final parts of the baby steps we currently are added that um\n[noise] we are a we have our emergency fund that's fully funded or currently cash flowing to kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus our house pathway currently oh about I'm Seventy eight thousand dollars on our home\nGood and what's your household income\nUh just under two hundred thousand a year\nFrom them and how much is college\nOn our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them okay good\nGood help doing all of that so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars and our retirement accounts my husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm\nMy company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest five percent may give me ten mhm [noise] so that's the fifteenth so my question is do I find a different way to invest that Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine a Fifteen or do we put that extra it's about three hundred\nAnd eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIt's four thousand dollars a year doing much when I\nSaw that sure well I mean you know you're acting like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\n\nRun it would make a much better day in my retirement account or a you know\nSo I I Want you to put a baby step for Fifteen Percent of your household income you put Fifteen Percent of your household into um into retirement it doesn't sound to me like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been 'cause I've only oh I'm I'm In the story and I think that ... thing is I put in my five and they put them in a timely amazing match\nYou know wonderful man to love them\nOh I didn't and then you know I think it'll probably happen in my eyes and they put in a time when I'm going to match you\nKnow it's wonderful match I Love the match or not going to lose the match we're going to do ten percent somewhere else like you said in ... we can do it there in the ... have you got good options if it's raw four one K. particularly I Would do that but I I I Would be putting Fifteen Percent of my income away in the return of the point is you're going to pay off his house\nAnyway right at really the exact same speed\nBecause four thousand dollars isn't what's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off\nWhat's going to get certainly a thousand dollars paid off when you got to concentrate on it when you get a little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze some money out of your budget but it does three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off because you guys have been concentrating and focusing and probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get kids off to roll you probably just gonna finish up the house and like that year a cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by the other than that year you'll just knock it out so\nUm you're ... you're doing really good obviously\nI mean you're doing really really good overall but I'm going to do ten percent you buddy\nFifteen Percent but that other temper sending in their retirement\nThat's your baby step for five your cash flowing six is everything else we can find reasonably within the budget\nArizona did you know your garage door represents up to

Marie ... wrote okay he was one of the main organizers of last night's migrant caravan prompting the president to order a deployment of National Guard troops to the border he was arrested Thursday um what's he doing there\nPrompting the president to order a deployment ... guard troops to the border he was arrested Thursday um what's he doing there\nYou know that's a great point I don't know whether he he he says he's not involved in Oregon organizing the most recent caravan but he's still down there helping them I guess navigate to the border ... so he is kind of helping he may not be organizing but you are\nI mean I don't want to go down the Martha McSally already committing treason by helping people come here I I don't know\nWho he was coordinating I mean that's that's not helping or is that being ... that's the question I don't know\nIf he does he does he have the GPS and he says we got to make a left\nUp here to get to the border right or is he saying you don't want there are a lot of people ...\nDon't have food they don't have\nA like a blanket to sleep right and you are you doing that 'cause that's different that's different but he ended up getting arrested in southern Mexico a while participating in one way or another to the migrant Caribbean so obviously there's always an Arizona tied to every big story a misses the big story and it's an Arizona side free\nAnd number three story on the on I was on a daily download nightmare for at Tucson parent and\nUh it's just kills you a Tucson mom is hoping that you can brighten her son's day over the weekend mom invited over thirty kids in school to attend little\nTeddy birthday party it Peter Piper pizza Peter Piper paid well in Tucson\nAnd the president is also saying that this caravan heading towards the U.S includes unknown middle Easterners\nHe's offered no evidence of that and that's BS you can't do it well you can if you're Trump you come out and say it you don't care what the repercussions are you don't care if it's true they're politicians ripe ripe politicians don't care if they're if they're what they're saying is factually correct so Trump says yeah we got a bunch of middle Easterners they're\nPut it this way or is there a chance that you've got some terrorists within seven thousand people of course right I mean there's a chance does he know that there are some middle Easterner that was you know it it was without tied up or what he doesn't know that so\nThis is one of those you know Trump lives because he can't prove it uh this is a Trump ally to it's it's basically saying you got to vote for Republicans in the mid term they say he's using this now as a political football and he said well we got terrorists now hold on a second\nThere might be somebody it within seven thousand people who want to come to the U.S and do you know bad stuff I get that but there\nAre they might just be from the middle east and want to be here I I who knows or\nThey're mostly asylum seekers ... starving people okay I I don't see I don't see of terrorists when mom in in a four year old or sleeping on the street and then getting back up and trying to walk towards the United states okay so let's figure out really who who is in this this caravan\nMostly asylum seekers most of them have a reason for leaving Honduras but is it good enough we don't know some are trying to get back\nInto the United states because they were kicked out there not asylum seekers right I don't let them back in ah do we have a terrorists I don't know But Trump's now using that card that's unfair you do not know that there are unknown middle Easterners I ah who are terrorists that are trying to get in the United states\nSo what is Trump ... what is he going to do what is it ... or his options well the first one is that he says he's going to reduce Central American aid\nWhich we've kinda gone down that road to what did I say last week if you reduce aid well then you'll only force more people to come here right because you're cutting off their aid so where are they going to go I go to go to the country that has the eight\nI said it last week I liked that he was threatening that but ultimately you can't go through with that\nYou would hope that if you threatened in Honduras and um [noise] Guatemala the that the government's which we're trying and and and keep people within their borders so you can threaten it but if you go through with it a ... that'll increase asylum seekers here to the United states\nSo far Guatemala Honduras El Salvador they get five hundred million right a fire they split it five hundred they split three ways five hundred million if you take that out of a a well ... well he said he's gonna he's gonna reduce he's not going\nIn right a fight they splitting five hundred they split three ways five hundred million if you take that out of a of well ... well he said he's gonna he's going to reduce he's not going to totally stop it but if ... if he stops it by you know a hundred million does that does that cause more people to come here I Would assume so yeah\nI don't like what I'm hearing with people saying these people are invaders\nI think that I I just think on a human level that's ridiculous ... and it's uncalled for\nUm I I think that most of them are probably starting a new most of them um and I I have some sympathy for them do what do I think that we should you know let everybody coming of course not of course not no no no we can't do that but to call them invaders Trump called them and named the other day let me let me get this audio um [noise]\nI think he set it in Phoenix excuse me Mesa Trump rally Mesa President Trump right\nNow is you know Mexico\nIs on their southern border their southern border [noise] and they're fighting and they're finding some bad people in that group you know you see the people come up and you're listening to the fake news back there and\nHe's not making any sense he's just rambling and ... and rambling the fake news okay move by the way most of the people who were covering the Trump rally wasn't CNN which yes can be fake news\nFox News certainly could be fake news 'cause they're for Trump\nCNN against Trump can't really tell you know right which one which side of the other most of them are are local media right and don't have they don't they don't have a talk show you know on cable news right trying to rip them they're just trying to discover rally yeah rally you think they're all [noise]\nYou think they're all wonderful [noise]\nDon't know you think serious you think there are wonderful I think he's talking about the people in the ... yeah\nGot some bad people and those groups you got some tough people in those goods and I'll tell you what this country doesn't want them [noise]\n... uh yeah so the bad people we usually get rid of there is a ... not all bad of course not of course not\nAnd and if you're out there and you're saying oh it's terrible they are coming to America They're trying to get asylum if you were in Honduras and you had kids and you and you were starving you do the same thing\nNow I ... some of you said well no I wouldn't you ask you what don't lie to yourself you know you would do that because you want to survive\nBut at the end of the day certainly I agree that we can't let everybody and we can't wait we can't have an open border that's ridiculous we've got to figure something out no one has been able to figure anything out yet\nAnd changed the laws because they won't change the laws because if they change the laws then they don't have a problem which they can't railed against for or against a ... immigration right\nSo you know I think both Republicans and Democrats\nThey like this they liked the caravan heading towards the United states because they get to use it okay we got the midterms coming up so the caravan has complicated to mid term election there's no no question about it which party will it hurt the most Republicans or Democrats can talk about that next [noise]\n[laughter] [laughter] we're\nOne Ninety two free and subscribe to the Arizona's morning news broadcast on apple pie ...\nMiserable
