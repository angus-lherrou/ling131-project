your money Tony is with us in Quincy, Illinois I Tony how are you\nAfternoon Dave thanks for taking my call it the pleasure to be speaking with you sir you too how can I help um yes we currently have a Nineteen year old with a family friend that my son's best friend living with us he makes about\nDeclares Eighteen hundred a month and he has a car payment to twenty to help on what should about eighty bucks and for gas about a hundred bucks we budget for the month um we're just trying to kind of figure out we got more nimble system since he's late with us real fast his his wallet was basically his bank account he has no bank account yet\nI'm what I'm wanting to know is how do we kind of go along and do the envelope system was budgeting has money and putting money away and trying to help and figure out what to do with all his actress\nOkay well I think you teach them how to do a budget and that is for every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and they all like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and skill that without um that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we're teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing the stuff that we talk about for a while and yeah we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nOkay we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you've got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this meeting no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that uh it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm a ... she said yes we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about on a debit card for that and then you know I I think you just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years and what are the steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nOkay how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep the car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then just just take the income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some that last set up for like I'm I'm ... and the ... like a car like emergency fond of are you going to your car stuff yeah I mean the things we do have savings corn about ten percent of marine home by we put in ...\nOkay well no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean on southern cows in dollars aside as my emergency fund and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt in five ... five grand and savings wouldn't he\nYeah it'd be really well off so\n[noise] okay well then I then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things and even start talking about maybe some additional savings so he can have his own place\nOkay thank you very much hey thank you for calling it appreciate your joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us from Wilmington North Carolina Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I have a question about and inherit temp [laughter] my husband and I are small business owners and we have a significant amount of debt with a business and our personnel allowed me to the Democrats are kind of lean years during the recession and uh several years ago\nThat we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inherit hits that we have [noise] I haven't had had that we can\nEase the kids' college have one daughter that than her freshman year of college now\n[noise] my husband had hope that we could ease for the kids' college have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and that neither one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and the baby and\nSo this business of making money\nIt's struggling hey it makes many now that we still have a good bit of data from how much profit um\nProfit [noise] uh [noise]\nGosh probably well I have to say probably it doesn't make it at the same for the past few years but um\nHow long you're going to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job there it's like that door closes and this has [noise] door stays open and um\nHis business doors not open it's not making enough to support your family\nAnd so we need to set down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start supporting our family after all these years and making it up to start getting rid of some of this debt or we're going to close it and get a job\nBecause I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay our cell tend to business on line with grant how am I about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing your you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of the business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars\nWell we can do that we had a lot of how much does it have you done with this guy about fifty TK um leap personally have about um Ninety six K okay\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it okay so that all is that I got to let her know if you have a hundred dollars in debt and you have a ... you have a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNow that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes is a right\nTo pay it has banned that were made with an account to adjust something there say that we're taking the distribution of standing all profit and that it doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business okay year so\nYou need to find out what the president she don't know what can you get back you can be three different answers so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on her does over here you got other problems\nRight he had a\n... and you get pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars is not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go clean up his dad gummed ... made\nOkay but I don't ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts\nMhm or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you you ought to be will do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses not on a plan and your personal lives on a plane I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got ... in the mail today and what did it start at ... ...\nThat's a good start and and I'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going no one's gonna quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we need to fine tune in give a I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it\nSo we need to fine tune our systems at the business the pit profit and loss statements the the\nBudgets at the business and so we knew exactly where every dollar at the businesses going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income and then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand other was a bit\nBetween these two different sets of debt\nAnd work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that goal if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the ... they're still at the ... the debt and throwing a system at your business in a system\nIn detail budget at your home in all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away in the twin on thousands ... of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money\nAnd the twin on thousands of parts of the solution to that but the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work pulled on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership this as the Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nI'm ... and I want to buy your house\nWho is this the Hopkins says you can buy your house without any fees are commission kind of person does this Doug says you can buy any house at any price and talk to his vice houses in as little as three days I mean really is this the kind of man you want to do business with what about his college years at ASU [noise]\nYeah then for for me I Would say it's just you know everybody's different in the way that they approach or this debt free journey Lindsey over here she's an excel guru in geek in loves\nTo see a split out I'm a put a thermometer up there and let me hold her in the whole thing and get me to the top oh man I go more goal driven in that but we do about it\nAll right but on the refrigerator right when we heard on the refrigerator so that everybody can see that we're in debt is kind of like you know when you're an alcoholic you go to Alcoholics Anonymous\nNow this was it it was like hey we're the ... were in debt I Am not I don't know it's our way of being honest and I end up front and letting people see kind of be a part of our journey if they enter a home\nSo that people look at you look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nYou know and it was a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders off and realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to the store and get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you know you can paid off soon no\nNo no that's not how I Wonder also right and you know obviously with with our little guy here in in our next one coming up for a little girl oh it was like you know it's now or never in the best times now when they're cheaper um and then you know once again the source of makes\nSense as a gun to exactly right well done you got ... very well done that's fun and so little guy came with you how old is he he's two years old and his name is eastern Carter Carol how can I should those eastern due to free scream just\nHit hard sell but he may be a

outrageously generous along the way so fun stuff Iraq\nAll right Brandon Lindsay and eastern from Los Angeles area thirty thousand dollars paid off and Thirteen months making one thirty to one fifty count it down a debt free screamer right three two one\n\nOpen phones up AAA eight to five five two to five you jumping\nAnd we'll talk about your life and your money Dale is with us in Kansas City Hi Dale how are you\nPoint it's like it's like ... but I sure what's up [noise] [noise] well I'm Wondering if I Need more life insurance ... okay\nHow much do you have\nA have a two hundred and fifty thousand okay what's your household income sorry\nWhat's your household income a hundred and eighty or do you make a hundred and fifty okay and you have two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your ... do you have and wealth um and invest much\nOr more debt free of them home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight mhm and then I have about four hundred thousand and four ones when we're all\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on land than home\n\nOh and ... and ...\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home a five hundred and twenty okay all\nRight well the income produced off\nOf six hundred and fifty thousand dollars let's just use it that's the two fifty and the four hundred you got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested than just rent round numbers just to make this easy if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nLive\nShe can't for service for half a million dollar debt was sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right\nYes okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your death now if she liquidate should input seven hundred thousand\nThe equity of that buys a two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then coming off of a million one\nThat makes sense so if that's your plan you're okay but if you want her to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance do you see him doing that\nIs are there okay so what's the goal which one\n\nWould you want her to stay a little and I want her to stay on the way she wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she live close with us from family okay\nAnd then if you if you want the ability to do that we need um [noise]\nYou know you need about a million five and insurance should use five hundred about to pay off the property she'd have a million dollars from change that way to live off the income from so somewhere a million million five and life insurance so you're seven fifty light at least be able to hit that using the simple numbers I was using their [noise]\n\nIf you're going to buy

hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me\nYes\nSo you must have done the world's worst real estate deal\nI I that well it likely satellite I we bought that happened to that effect you know

worst house\nAnd we said twelve years it sucks [laughter] so you don't think we should wait for ... you know just suck born four years\n[noise] All right do you get that back I mean actually my question make as right now we're at ... baby step that respect here's the thing\nWe gave you three hundred thousand dollars in cash would you go by the house next door\nNow why because this sucks\nThis neighborhood is not appreciating for some reason or another it's the world's worst rate of return meanwhile the rest of the nation grew up the way down and his up twenty percent\nI I I agree with that is why I'm calling in because I'm trying to fight if we should continue to write this out no wait until okay\nNo it's a bad investment it's a bad neighborhood I don't know what's wrong here but I mean a ... a house you paid three and fifty thousand dollars for in two thousand freaking six before the crash it goes down and it's not even recovered back to three fifty\nIt mean that's a very unusual real estate market unusually bad and I don't want to invest in it and going forward and so I wouldn't keep it going forward take your take your loss and get out you bought in a really bad place for some reason I don't know what's wrong but that's the worst numbers I've heard and I don't know when\nI mean everywhere else just about as recovered Florida went down the Knicks went down freaking Las Vegas crashed and has recovered\nYou know I mean but there's some you know there's some parts of Detroit that habit but that was her economic pockets but it's not an overall national economy thing and so you don't buy in bad economic\nPockets yeah and you don't keep in bad economic pockets and so out of there I'm Out of there from you amount of they're done quickly done yes thanks

own your stupid car a twenty thousand sell it\nAnd say that\nYeah you don't make thirty five thousand dollars a year driving twenty thousand dollar car that didn't work\nYou've got too much tied up and things going down in value and you've got a four hundred and fifty dollar car payment don't you\nFind sixteen dollars\nAlmost like I've done this before [noise] yep yep that's killing yah\nIs not a blessing is it\nKind of the car\nIt's not a blessing it's financially killing you\n... owns you you work for this car\nYour part time job that you two is because of this car\nIt's not worth it sell the car and then work your way through the debt and then you'll be debt free in about a year year and a half max and then and you know including the car that you buy that's very very cheap that you use like five thousand dollar car that you pay cash for or you pay it off very very quickly with your other debts but\nI mean you love this car if you want but I don't love a score it's a stupid car and it's killing you your numbers are horrendous on this um\nIf you have more than half of your income tied up in cars or things was motors in them all totaled up then you have too much of your life tied up and things that are going down in value and you're always going to struggle\nIt's causing you to be middle class or lower middle class socio economically speaking financially speaking and it's all because of a choice of what you're\nChoosing to drive I Would not choose to drive that I Would rather be wealthy and drought whatever I Want later Dr like no one else so later you can drive like no one else get your life back this thing homes you hope that helps you know it was what you want to but\nWe don't give you which one would give you what you need it's good for you as we care about

than I\nThought he was like okay we can do it but the thing was we had a chip planted Disney and December ... yeah so I was like oh no we need a castle and he's like a week away\nAnd so actually we prayed and fast it for forty days whoa it's like I guess I Want to court because I'm kind of extreme that he called me I'm just dedicated and I'm not I'm just motivated to get out and you know and so that really helped that you know I Want to court and yes\nIt is an actor you ... once you are of one record nothing can stop you exact or not they stop you and you guys you you're forced to be reckoned with now\nI mean you'll you'll be able to pay cash for how you're going to be able to do anything you want to do the rest of your life the generosity you'll be able to do\nYou're going to run into people that need help and you'll be able to just do it not think about it right um 'cause nobody owns you now that's it yeah you're no longer a slave to the lender is right that's a pretty impressive stuff gosh wow very cool so what do you tell people that key to getting out of debt is\nOh that's a that's a great question um one thing I can say is you you have to be committed a once you agree to do something you have to be committed to do it and and you have to see beyond your current situation you have to see what you want to be more than you see where you are ...\nSo once you can see beyond that then you can start to dream a and and there's many times where we actually drove through neighborhoods and looked at the nice houses and say you know when we do this right we can go pick a house and we can do that but we wanted to do it right\nKnow I thought about that Sharon I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and this and go you know someday we could do that and here's all we've got we've got to this this and this and then we can get there\nAnd it wasn't like oh we'll never get their roll our eyes open for those bigger evil rich people was more like I'm going to be one of you and you know and that's what you do when you drive and they brought them all live here and I live in that one you know just like that you know riding and that's a good I'd forgotten we did that too\nBecause it gets it gets down inside of you then doesn't it doesn't it does and then you could sell stupid that's all right that you know and get your whatever you have the boat and get you on lighter man goes back to live like nobody else later you can live and give like no one else because you're not giving up forever\nThat's right if you think you're given up their stuff forever it's real painful to sell all this and that you guys you know you clean house literally\nAnd give like no one else 'cause you're not giving up forever that's right if you think you're given up their stuff forever it's real painful shallow was is that you guys you know you clean house literally I mean literally\n...
