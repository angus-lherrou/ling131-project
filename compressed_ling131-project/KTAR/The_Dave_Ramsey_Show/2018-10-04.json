dollars from his father when he got sick\nThat he says he was self made and French Trump was only good but he was great when friends from obviously had way more than ... than he's ever had\nAnd we in this clearer timeline that he has been just been feeding from the friend trough his entire life [laughter] this is the truth isn't this something that he should own instead of saying he's a self made man\nWell first of all\nHow much money did he get remember you're converting it into today's dollars he's worth billions and even if he got four hundred million he's worth billions two billion three

they don't give a rat's ass they don't care how he made his money\nWell what if he cheated did he cheat or did he cheat according to you because you want that money 'cause you think that's the thing that's fair\nRight you think that's the thing that's fair that's what you want you want it to be fair because for whatever reason you believe that money is the government's money why so into giving the government more power and more money please for the love of God tell me why\nYou it's grotesque I mean it's just unbelievable and and you know might have some I'm so impressed by the quality of the journalism and the care with which this has done\nBut there's really a larger political message here which is that if you get a W to like most people you get a salary you have basically no chance to to to cheat on your taxes I mean they they they withhold a certain amount every two weeks that's just sort of how taxes work in this country\nBut if you're rich like the trumps you can set up a system like this\nThat's right but you set up a system like this within the parameters that the government has set up and because they can beat the system\n\nThey can beat the system they can beat the

things against the Russians\nThat aren't in his best interest there are other things you could come out and say well more curious about this are more curious about that but okay at least I can understand that and he did say look if you want to show his taxes that's on him but he says a lot of things as do a lot of politicians\n\nBut this obsession with OPM other people's money this

I I mean if I'm you I'm going to be all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker and his momma is calling me you single\nAfter his mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what got a fifty fifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on his little head okay\nYou know and then you you better plan on paying it if that ... doesn't get moving okay right so it really does you know ball and knock it out and then you'd miss chalk it up to that and but dude I'm telling you ah we're going to have some discussions is he married\nHis girlfriend\nOkay I'll bet she works forty hours yes there yeah there you go [noise] alright open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I don't think he set out my budget I Do the every dollar budget [laughter] come on baby step to crank protect my expenses for the month [laughter]\nProject what I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down and I had to have a tone and repaired and it costs almost five hundred dollars [laughter] hello some had in mind off on that we that we now\n... do you have your your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward debt for that month so I get it wrong that would\nBe okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash flow in that month that's fine I didn't\nShe finds so you're paying more than five hundred dollars extra on debt each month\nYeah good answer you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap what this thing but usually you're not going to have that month than a month out now there's some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor ... you know you don't have anything budgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to have anything\nThat she did for car repair it\nYeah I probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on that car in a given six month period of time it might be tires that might be maintenance you might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving really nice brand new cars you're going to spend something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regard\nSo probably going to add a little bit of a sudden it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up\nAs a sinking fun they call it than the every dollar software or in a ... I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash than for your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did find just to cash flow through that emergency ... slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick backed up next month hopefully won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nDid hear ... you're doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nThank you [laughter] I'm On earth laid to gather a long time you and I [laughter]\n[noise] so the question to you so my wife and I we have about three hundred okay and and student did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile and a line of credit that type of thing so it's about four Fifteen\nAnd we make a pretty good income shootout about one twenty annually I met one eighty three hundred come on my question for you I was a move back to school to get my master's programs only twenty five okay so I feel like that would be a very real are why on it\nBut over the last three days are starting to think who may be maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on that\n... masters in one [noise] oh it would be an ... ...\n... ...\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K\n[laughter] it would probably be but it's hard to say um that would be when he came and raise 'cause it'd be category I Would jump into mhm\nOkay he would be doing that you can get back into it would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget is you make so stinking much money now you live in a very expensive area granted\nIt's crazy and can\nI ask you want to live in a really ... yeah but you guys are really you are really ... and\n...\nAnd so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four hundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt plan\nTo be your daddy like know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare talk to me by buying anything else\nYou bought enough crap for a while you need to you need a live like people that make a hundred people that make three hundred and get this debt ceiling\nAnd in the process of doing that can you we've twenty grand a month I ran into the budget\nDelays you buy\nThis is a diver and\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and eating\nThey're getting to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip recruiter dot com slash have to hire the right person zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding you\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college has a lot less expensive and you get your basics out of the way for the first two years for\nA four year degree if you want to start the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is college cost is the number one cause of student loan debt\nAnd what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a huge pickup truck both our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of them all\nAnd and so if you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful thing you want to but wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need to have you met\nWith rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr an after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and\nYou'd probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for ...\nThat'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job\nThe third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do I'm not talking about minimum wage crap and if you're going to live on campus go ahead and be an R. A. B. a residential advisor or written that's not what they call it what is in RA\nHow it is it is a resident about okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and uh you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be NRA if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the University of the tuition might be completely free\nAnd that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what the steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their figure out scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plan on working your butt off\nAnd those things will get you through school completely dead free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey ... thank you for everything that you do thank you I just wanted to give me a call and aren't you know that one I Am that free I'm On baby step three I got five months saved up two months ago are my six months but here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment\nAnd I have a small a job that I find myself on the fire\nOn at that point in the retail establishment where I think it's time for me to stay out of years and we'll start my\nFocused towards my my own personal business I Want to know should I you can't shoot you wouldn't buy me use my emergency fund to help me through that I was growing pains of being full time with my small ...\nNo it's not an emergency um\nYou're creating an emergency by leaving the job too soon I don't blame you from one to leave and we wanted to do your own thing I Want you to do that too but once you get out and get your side business making more money you're going to work anymore\nAnd you may have to just take fewer hours at the retail thing and back your hours down that may mean you move to a different retail job I don't know but today you're not making enough money on the side job or you wouldn't have asked that question\nNot true much money you make it on the side\nBut a meat nearly um probably pulling out about twice\nWhat was your best month over\nUh about four thousand one was a ah probably about seven

brother and I are a part of the small business and I'm Around Lance fear my wife uncle had um had a sign up for what's called a ... an insurance policy\nNow I'm a little ignorant to add to what it is going to bring that to protect my wife and me then she became a guy because here but in the event that anything happened to me she kind of get my portion of the business but it also work has that retirement hiring type of thing so I'm kinda just calling to see what\nWhat your opinion is of that type of policy and if it's necessary or or what I what I should do\n... team in is what it's doing it's not a type of policy so let's separate the two things sold you a piece of crap called a whole live life insurance policy because it has built it is okay has a built in savings program\nOkay so we're going to cancel the stupid policy like key man's simply means it's typically used in in a situation like you're in in business uh by cell agreement and the way it would work is that uh you you said you're in business with who your brother\nMy brother ... and so uh let's say you died the life insurance on you would go to him giving him the money to buy your share of the business from your wife\nOkay because he doesn't want to be a partner with your wife or not because\nHe ate your wife maybe because you had your wife but not because he had your wife but more likely because she didn't want to be in the business right\nSo it would I ever had in the ... er and and you do it in reverse as well he needs to buy a policy on him that goes to you but it's state in in the partners\nWon't have the same thing we're both okay so you're both going to cancel this crap and I was going to get up for it\nIt's going to get out without a computer crap\nYeah you're going to buy term life insurance that will do the same thing for about a nickel on the dollar for what you're seeing now okay what's the face somebody on that it's what's the face of Memphis given to him if you die\nOr her um I have to I'd have to double check I don't I don't remember what we signed up for and like I said it was it says well over a year\nAgo okay and putting in you know paying their premiums premium I suppose you know like I said\nYou know have articles are are you in L. L. C. or are you a\nGeneral partnership that weren't escort escort okay do you have articles of incorporation that defined what happens in the event of death\nUm I'm not sure if they're trying what happens in the event of that and now I'm not I don't know\nYou need to have a what's called I buy\nSell agreement okay and it's funded by inexpensive term life insurance\nTerm okay trivia with attorney or certain if there's a whole lifestyle now as it goes all lives as the only one\nThat has a retirement benefit later okay I got that means that as a savings element and that means it's twenty times more expensive for the same amount of insurance\nRight now you got me he's like oh and you're you know when you're sixty this is what are the ... the cash value will be yeah\nYeah and you know the next number at the end and I'm like okay\nSo here's the thing if you spend one acts instead of twenty acts to accomplish your business goal\nOf being able to buy out the widow of the one that there's a lot that died right uh that's the business go and you spend one acts of doing that you use the other Nineteen next to invest and you'll have a whole lot more money than you would have had inside this piece of crap policy that he bought and sold you\nOkay that's the problem ... life insurance has a horrible right of return it's loaded with fees and uh if you die they do not pay you the money that's in savings that you pay the extra create they only pay the face value and so the ... the money that you're playing time for the\nMoney that you're paying extra for to create savings is all being done poorly that's the problem here\nI Gotcha okay that makes sense yeah I'm a new listener so I'm you know six months I've kinda been grinding Mickey at my wife and our own baby step to cool so I'm now going to want to cash out that whatever it is in the whole like you and then you go with the term\nThing or you get term policy in place first case she died while the ball right an issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this and you can accomplish the goal and that it's going to help you clean up your escort\nCorporate documents by having your attorney and it's not it's a one page thing but it's yeah ... and then you need to cover that with all the four of you sit down the spouses and go okay if he dies\nI won't be getting money to buy you out sister in law okay you're going to be out of the business that's our thing and um and if I die\nMy wife's going to be out of business 'cause my brother is going to buy her out and he's going to have the money to do that from life insurance\nFrom the okay from this new term policy\nAnd it and it stated that that money has to be used for that\nFor that specific bought for the buyout yeah\nYeah ... that's the by cell agreement is very standard stuff in a situation like you're in\nOkay awesome I really appreciate your health\nThank you brother thanks for calling him open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money [noise] John is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance is is a life insurance today\nUm group life insurance means that you're buying life insurance through your company that's what you would have to mean by that the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on the entire group\nYou buy a lot of insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished to you through your company as a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance or benefits package or life insurance benefits package um\nI it's okay to buy that it's usually if you are buying it and that was three of your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying for it it's usually not that much cheaper is maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in insurance world is you leave the company\nYou can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or a minor heart attack and now you're not sure if\nYou get diabetes now you're not insured rubble\nAnd you leave that company you got no life insurance that you can't take this with\nSo it's okay to have a little at the company but I wouldn't have it all their lives is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary things and they start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life your seat\nChanging these habits is the foundation of our teaching at the smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and winter\nTo be transformed by the renewing of your mind you know don't be conform to this world they're crazy out there and don't be don't be like everybody else they're nuts and uh my pastor always said don't let the world teach theology\nAnd you know I don't know so let's stop you guys so what do you tell people when they find out you got forty nine thousand dollars worth of debt paid off what do you don't like the keys to getting out of debt are\nBut like I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh I always wanted to drive a newer car never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment and so you know you pay for a guard for five or six years\nAnd then what do you think you should we get another payment and so we have not had a car payment for four years we were driving to very old cars and one is sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old wow but we drove it up here from South Carolina this morning and it made it fine so it made it finally gets us where we need to go and you know never again\nNever again well now you don't really pay much you can save up in ... by a little better car that's right yeah what about you know early what are usually the keys to getting out of that are\nAnd for me it was mostly contentment I'm like I like to watch HDTV and make lots of money the list of laid back and be content with what we've got and I'm just kind of weight on it until we have that way\nI'm kinda interested when you sat down to do the taxes that night and you had a moment\nIt was kind of that I've had it moment we're not living like this anymore I'm I've come to the end of this we're going to change can you describe what was happening inside of you or what was happening in your head or in your heart\nI felt like probably like everything I was doing\nWas kind of ... I\nMean I kind of wanted to be a stay at home mom but\nWith his income that requires me to come back we're ... we didn't go to school and it wasn't making any different ... we wish killing that we were making any practice and everything that came in going right back out\nYeah don't invading feels like a rat in the oil\nAnd we kind of made a goal back then that we want it to be free by the time my son went to high school and so we did that by a month oh awesome you started highschool this August and we were debt free in July\nSo his senior years the debt for a year ... when you started started out of school yeah very\nGood we didn't want all of this growing appears to be in that and we wanted him to to to learn from us and understand what it means to to get out of debt and we haven't taken a vacation in two years and\nYou know be up you know we've gone to the beach every year and uh he was frustrated but he was you understood and every so often it was kind of cool because we would take these little sticky notes\nEvery month and we paid off it but what our new balance was free and we put that on the refrigerator we put it on the bathroom mirror ... and every so often he would walk in the kitchen and say where we're at a you know where we are so he he was he was kind of in tune with the whole thing and\nSo you know he'll have that memory um when he looks back even if he stumbles a little bit financially and he'll still have that memory going I remember when mom and dad did that and so I can do that\nYou've changed your family tree in that regard it's like I've got the memory and you do to maybe ... or ... I remember working my grandpa pull night a lot of a board\nAnd you know we weren't allowed to throw it away you had to put it back down to straighten it out and throw it in a coffee can and keep that were used breaking nail that that's because of his you know the great depression influence\nAnd um but I I have that memory working with him now all these years later and um I mean is coming up on a hundred years ago that that event occurred but it's still impacting this family\nAnd that that's what's gonna happen there he'll remember those sticky notes just like I remember those nails that's that's good that's very good\nIf we're seeing it take root in him and he started a well known business and you move on to all summer and he had something very specific that he wanted to buy and he's pretty much say all of his money all summer so we can buy that things\nAre very good I mean that that's that's all I excellent now he's now he's on track for sure but well done you to we've got a copy of Chris focused retire inspired books for you\nOr because we want the next chapter for you to be millionaires and a and B outrageously generous along the way and of course will know you we know you will do that pasture no doubt about it so very well done\nWeight and normally Greenville South Carolina forty thousand dollars paid off in twenty six months that three eighty five thousand eighty seven thousand dollar income counted down unless you're a debt free scream three two one\nLove it [noise] you want to change your family tree requires to think [noise]\nIs by upgrading your flooring and counter tops from my friends at imperial wholesale\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven the imperial family has been shopping the globe\nHand selecting first quality stone pile flooring and importing right here\nTo the valley and of course all at imperial slow wholesale pricing like right now imperial has the valley's largest selection of eight by eight deco tiles exclusively imported from Spain and Italy with dozens of pattern styles and colors to choose from\nThese tiles will be of any room or a wall in your home a classic mid century modern design and it only three Ninety nine a foot that's an upgrade to fit any budget cedar store for details the Mesa warehouses open to the public is an imperial wholesale dot com for hours in directions\nThat's imperial wholesale dot com\nArizona's afternoon news with matching data\nRepublican Senate candidate Martha mix Sally told us if she were a senator she would vote yes for Brett Kavanaugh now the FBI investigation is over how will the Senate vote will talk about that today a two [noise]\nFor that I lost three twenty three whatever you do work heartily\nAs for the lord and not for me\nMartin Luther king junior said no workers in significant all labor that up lives has dignity and importance and should be undertaken\nAll across the country including orthodontics for kids and adults and if you've already been told by a dentist that you need a procedure but you haven't gone yet it's not too late to safe join one dental schedule your appointment with a one dental provider and save big instantly\nKnow waiting just instant membership and instant savings folks one dental is a smart decision for you and your family start saving debate at one dental dot com that's one dental dot com\n[noise] ARM Glendale he's Arizona's news agency a bad mother\n\nWhat it sounds like in the heart Senate office building in Washington DC is anti Kavanaugh protesters solver senators to vote no on the Supreme\nCourt nominee lawmakers aren't seeing eye to eye over the FBI report on sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh Democrats they it's income sleep and limited the whole thing\nIs a sham five days to do the investigation\nThat's democratic Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia but Republicans say they're ready to move forward with the process and hold a vote on his confirmation\nNow's the time to quit all of these antics these high jinx the circus like atmosphere will do that tomorrow morning when we both\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas two of the swing vote senators Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona both of us the jets they might be satisfied with the pro going at thorough democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota also considered a swing vote says she will vote against Kavanaugh\nIn South Carolina to the police officers involved in yesterday's ambush style attack that left one officer dead have been released from the hospital Richland county sheriff Leon ... remembering officer parents Caraway who was killed\nThat made him a great cops it made him a great person and it's that spirit and that temperament was abusing him\nThe suspect Fred Hopkins is a disbarred lawyer the jury's now deliberating in Chicago the murder trial of white police officer Jason Van Dyke he's charged in the shooting death of black teen ...

D. yeah that's what we'll Jeff Flake do\nOkay so the FBI is done finished yesterday they handed in the report about Supreme Court nominee Jeff and Jeff have it on\nThe White House or Senate senators have seen it Jeff Flake has seen it what is he going to do in my opinion there was no chance this guy votes no no chance he only wanted this FBI investigation to give them cover I think he's got ... I think he's always been got loose and I think if he really didn't want\nCabin ought to be a Supreme Court justice you still wouldn't vote no so I think he's a total yes and he's videos for a long time\nThe FBI investigations over so is it that Jeff Flake says okay you gave me what I Want so I'll just vote to go ahead and nominate the guy\nOr does he vote if somebody else votes no well I thought it was a good point yeah I kind of thought that he would try to get together with other Democrats and Republicans and say hey I wasn't going to take the sole bullet on this if you're going to vote no I'm going to vote no but I've got covered that\nWell I can say I voted yes because they had the FBI investigation we just don't know yet if I were just like I'd vote no\nAnd here's why it's not because of the allegations of not because of the FBI investigation I think I Would vote no because this guy can't be fair\nShe hates the Democrats on the Senate or reduce your got an extra ... you can't be fair is that's the case\nOr make Sally would vote for Kavanaugh\nWell we had Martha McSally on yesterday here on the show in Studio ... at\nThis point you know based on what I Know unless there's some new revelations in the in the FBI investigation I Would vote for for about ...\nOkay so when we ask that question back I don't know what you were thinking here's what I was thinking veterans would question I don't want to I don't want to and\nI don't want to well I don't want to I I really don't have a vote so I'm not going to really doesn't matter what I Would riot no I'm Glad she gave us a yes or a no ... that\nShe said okay I'm gonna give you an answer and she gave us an answer and that's all I can ask for\nWhat surprised me is that being a a a sex abuse survivor right he was sexually abused and high\nRight he was sexually abused in high school she talked about it on the show and she how how again it was [noise]\nShe thought doctor forge testimony was ... a compelling but she also understood Brett Kavanaugh basically saying hey you guys are ruining my reputation and ruining my life but I still thought she would have voted no but she said no I Would vote yes if I could\nWell it's tough I mean where's the proof we but we've been asking for a long time is there proof that this happened\nI mean all we could go on is what Dr Ford said and what\nKavanaugh said there's nothing out of this FBI report this FBI reports of joke I mean I even talked to cabinet or poor so\nI think more than ... you know\nHer the people that are going to vote for more than mc Sally would want her to votes your cabinet right so that's part of it too [noise]\nThree story on the all Arizona daily download 'em motorcyclists\nPulls a monthly yeah remember representative\nPaul Mosley remote to drive fast and brag about it when he was pulled over I mean the guy that got fired by the people of Arizona yes in the election ya I'm motorcyclists a I was going a hundred\nAnd six miles per hour or near the U.S sixty and ugly road GPS pulled him over and this guy said\nI didn't even see you there well of course she didn't see the D. P. S. officer everything's a\nBlurred a hundred and sixty miles an hour on a motorcycle I Want to know if he was wearing a helmet I Do too I really do I have a lawyer in Arizona you don't have to wear one right I get nervous around motorcycle riders not because they don't know what they're doing um\nYou know you'll get one that will cut in front of you weave in and out of traffic when it's kind of gridlock and that'll take you off but I just I was that necessary\nTo ... to investigate and they wrapped it up last night right if you were in charge of the investigation would you have\nIt up so quickly what would you ask for more time or said hey look it's going to take us weeks to do this or is it just looked just take some cursory notes just wrap it up as quickly as possible and let's move on what would you have done\nI think first of all I think they did what they were told to do as I mentioned earlier they were told to go interview whoever they talked to mark judge I think was one of them in the you know they did is throws they could they probably talked to him and others with an attorney present\nA and they got whatever they got this and the report and they moved on and so they had finished\nThey gave them a week to finished finding as few number of people apparently they found them or maybe they found some of them is that I'm not going to talk to you which is you know would only be within your right\nSo it's like that's it so I think the FBI stepped into this with you know we're doing this because the White House requested it and now we're going to stop\nSo does although he doesn't mean did the White House request that the FBI don't interview cabinet and Ford and so they did well I think\nThat I think they were told that that wasn't on the list that wasn't on the list to interview the ... that's what I think because that's where I Would have started I Would have done lengthy interviews with each one of them right to build to build what\nWent on in their lives when they were Fifteen and Seventeen hundred you date where did you go how much did you drink what houses did you go to what friends would kind of know where the parties were back then you can figure all that stuff out but it would take time to do\nAnd so it was clear to me when this was ordered that that was it that wasn't the intent of this at all and so basically you you sort of button hold the FBI to do\nThe half a dozen things you asked them to do and then stop\nSo it looks you know ... of the parents that it's a thorough investigation but there's there's really no way to to to do that in four or five days\nSo if if President Trump when he said do you have to do interviews whoever you want this or that wasn't the case\nI don't think that was the case at all now you know when he said in public and when his lawyers were telling the FBI they couldn't couldn't do is ... I'm sure to different things\n... we're talking with Brad Garrett ABC News crime and terrorism analysts former FBI special agent\nOr does any part of this give you pause or just make you smack your head and say what is going on is if the amount of time is it the White House actually having to do this investigation what makes you uncomfortable about this whole thing\nThat we sort of seemed to be missing the point so it let's look at it for thirty seconds to sway okay\nIf ... separate the sexual assault allegation stuff and they'll get over here and then look at what characteristics in temperaments that you want for somebody to be a Supreme Court you know what is their temperament or what is their honesty\nOr or you know what is their integrity I mean you know judge Kavanaugh sit at some things in\nAnd I'll sit and some things in his statement and then of course has his attitude was like\nYou know I wouldn't call when he was saying you know\nSort of a judge like or objective and then he was just ...\n... ... and going after the Democrats and so he's you know he had a right to do that and he did it I'm old suggesting is isn't shouldn't we be looking at that stuff too does he have the right temperament too partisan to be a Supreme Court justice [laughter] it's gonna be fascinating assuming he gets confirmed\nOf how many lawyers that go in front of the Supreme Court are going to ask him to recuse himself because they don't think his objective now they may not win at that but the ball is getting to eat up for all of that in my view\nBrad Garrett ABC News crime and terrorism analyst for FBI special agent brat as always thanks for the insight we appreciate your time okay as\nWell that's been my my whole thing on Kavanaugh for or you know well over a couple of weeks um you know he is he is he a judge who should be on the Supreme Court probably you're probably I mean he's he's been a very good judge I mean he's got a a terrific you know record in the court\nBut after he sat there and it wasn't the anger that really bothered me in his testimony it was that he's going to be biased\nYou mean when he started talking about the Cleveland his job with a hit job in a conspiracy have you\nBack for ... I mean I've said this before\nI didn't know that he was like that and maybe the only reason he was like that is because he's been put through the ringer light is right but let's also be clear though too when you're on the Supreme Court you are known by the way you rule whether you're a liberal a moderate or conservative\nBut do you want somebody on the Supreme Court that has an automatic revenge bias\nAgainst a certain ... or a certain ... see I don't either I don't mind if you're a conservative I don't know as long as you try to be fair and not say he's got an axe to grind out that guy tried to get me right I'm going to make sure I'm going to stop his whatever lost the gender whatever\nFor me it doesn't have to do with with the sexual assault allegations because I think you know you make up your mind who do you believe you but we don't want to the other\nPoint I don't think the U.S this FBI investigation has changed anyone's mind about how they feel about this no I don't think so either\nI don't think so either but I just don't think he's going to be fair that's it I said before this whole thing started I thought he ... he was a great pick I thought he'd probably be pretty good at looked into his background while I looks really good so all I'm saying is put another conservative on the bench not this guy I don't think you can be fair he's got an axe to grind with with with Democrats there's no question about it\nAll right uh we'll get more into this and what will Jeff Flake do yeah uh he had a key Senate races\nComing up next a valley man says he was viciously beaten for no reason by the Mesa police so will tell you why he deserved to be down he got to be an honest next\n[laughter]\nGet some perspective with Britain Pamela if the country seems more politically divided than ever ... well that's because it is we got a new study that his horse Haitian America back several we've all been think definitely get worse but how do we make it better\nBruce St James ... tomorrow morning at nine Casey a our news Ninety two three SM\nSo here's a great way to improve the taste of the water in your home purchased a Connecticut\nConnecticut will do everything it's unbelievable or it will make your water tastes pure it'll be perfect kinetic also protects your plumbing appliances and fixtures\nAnd it removes chlorine there's so much chlorine in the Arizona water supply so what Connecticut does the Connecticut system a kinetic go salt water softer\nIt's going to remove that core ring and you'll drink more water because it tastes like water not what's in your pool\nOkay it also make your the decor and also makes your skin drawing itchy and feed your laundry get rid of all that stuff get a kinetic go you can have great drinking water at the top and you will never ever have to mess with bottled water again\nSix to nine one oh six five seven no mention gay does they will come to your house for free in home consultation six to nine one oh six five seven ...
