child you're an awful person [noise]\nThirty kids didn't show up and then then it came to my mind as well wait a minute here there's no way\nLike thirty kids just don't show up just\nNo way like that's that that is and then I was reminded you know Jack showed up an amazing with Jack is you're going to these things you may not like it\nBut you're going somebody takes the opportunity to invite you some of these things are highly enough of you to invite you to something you're going to go\nAnd jak which there was a party with ...

matter the voting public they're like doing pretty good job and they're like well it's wait this is the title because it says that people have approved he did say he okay it says it yeah but the Bible

all apparently Trump is is is fuming and his pitch that the Saudis and the way this thing has gone down\nAnd it is it is getting uglier and uglier and everyone has come out talking about this\nThe information and the evidence that we have so far collected [noise] indicate that Jim ... was slain in a vicious violent yeah\nYeah absolutely absolutely\nI think we know that that people like why is this a big deal why some guy was a journalist to hung out with bad people who said some things that were awful at times gets a ... a pass and somehow we're all supposed to care about I said well it's not just\nTo think of it like this it's not just this there are so many other things because you don't you know a MPs the guy the the ... the prince the things around the prince\nThat have added up to it whether it be the way that he's treated many others\nThe way that he's violently crushed descent or anything like that the way that he's extorting money from family members that are fairly locked up his mother and and and they done so many things that's the fear that people that this is just the straw\nThat is breaking a the camel's back if you will that is the issue that people are having this it's not just one 'cause everybody's looking at the micro why should we care about this it's not just this it is so many other things and this just happens to be\nMaybe the final straw for a lot of people\nThink oh this was just an accidental death\nOr you send a forensic pathologist with the bones are just in case you might have a fist fight we after this member somebody I mean how horrific but then also having a body double I think there's a lot of reasons to think this was planned and I think because they have such an authoritarian government\nNothing over there happens it's not directed from above you don't act without orders\nSo it's kind of a stretches credulity to think that the crown prince wasn't involved in\nThem yeah yeah absolutely one hundred and ten percent\nWe

the world that doesn't have a lot of influence when it comes to a more modernized progressive ideas\nBut think of it across the board\nIn how that this guy is gone and handle things while in some ways

thing you've got to look at you or it could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway the answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured well yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nThere would be your cause a except that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you know statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental up as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see it\nLife or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay in order to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nFor joining us America we're glad your ears\nFor like eight to five five two to five Chelsea is in Los Angeles high Chelsea how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nOur the papers the salary my my husband is transitioning it tricked condition I'm aware they're going to be giving him a pay raise\nBut with that the rave there I'm saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week so I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an art form I forget that when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend to calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours she was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that in overtime correct\nCorrect and so what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand and how will that compared to the salary but that's the part that we don't know yet\nConservative shower really read it at the salaries fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nRight\nYes that makes sense it's like yeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it was just more of a sense where in the ... member to mhm um I I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nVery yeah but but the question the question is not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up and the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be living to management because it shows\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say OK they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary will we be dancing wouldn't we\nYes\nOkay 'cause that's like that's like getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like ... it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on you see what I'm saying\nBut it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did in my favor and it's been and he gets paid forty but he's worked in the same number of hours where he's working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah they're just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay long term it's a long term good career movies moving into leadership and the management and that's where he wants to head towards long term but I'm\nThe you know yes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand which is our new 'cause that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nChris is with us from Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how're you\nDoing good they take Michael sure what's up\n[noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm like income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt\nA battle eleven thousand a student loan debt that it ah that that about six months ago was a lot about Nineteen thousand [noise] I've been working working hard saved my money and and it often much as I can good cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention\nAnd I don't know whether to keep you know\nThat can good a lot of cooks right now I came up with the idea for an invention ...\nI don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so I mean it kind of want a young lady of financial advice and you know what to do with the remaining dead I have ... and yeah my aspirations because I'm In the process I've been saving to ah get heavy a home loan now is just about their so any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciated right\nWell I'm going to avoid buying a home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now 'cause we don't need to make a a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of them twenty thousand dollars touch a show the invention you came up with as a physical product\nESO at say a odor the odor either slash a mold\nA little small machine that um people getting on their home\nOkay and you've made one\nI made a very um rudimentary crowded tight mhm the next the next phase I've got is like either the at the end of my rainy day fund or start coming in my regular cash\nFlow and like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling and get me a couple of silicon prototypes and go you know take it to a you know take the next level of what I Want to do so again Dr jump off my my debt plan more do I have his mind Vinton [laughter]\nOkay um well what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of 'em and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that there was a market for it before you went into production\nBecause you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you can't let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement or if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them you know show went on for I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one\nAnd let's find somebody to put one in the in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you'd convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the ... the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the deal works than what I'm going to want you to his place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if they place that order they just place of deposit with you large enough\nTo build the order\nMhm and it finds itself that's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\nWhen they think I should dial down my\nRather than just spend all my extra capital towards paying off my credit card debt and my student loan debt\nI don't think Jeb diamond much capital on this you've already you're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right [noise]\nWell I keep it in that but I I just see I'm a perfectionist I Want it to be you know a good product\nThat's another so prominent lived there on Oprah factions [laughter] very they're very purpose of a prototype is find all the crap that's broken [laughter] want to get it\nPerfect you're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn foreman function changes informing function changes in the switch has to be on that side in this which has to be made out of this instead of that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but\nLet's get two of them in somebody's restaurant in there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them and somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ...\nI'm ... and then they give you enough money\nIn their deposits for the initial order for you to do your manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket\nExcept your brain power and your sweat\nAnd your smile out there selling it\nAnd you're factoring and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket except your brain power and you're sweating\nAnd your smile out there selling it\nAnd that's how a lot of these things get off the ground\nBoy a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production before somebody proving it into the marketplace or the actual prototypes\nAnd you're talking to a guy who's lost money that way does stupid stuff so go easy man go easy this is that Iran to show\n[noise] in the valleys out the graphics are your go to printing partners\nEighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the car dash in how 'bout you teach people how to keep up with the Joneses so\nThere were no sign you are and they come over there doing it infomercial regularly scheduled programing [laughter]\nThank you very nice well it is fun because not only to hold you accountable but you get to watch people you really get a front row seat to watch people change their lives\nAnd those nine weeks you know we've had stories folks come up to us and and and and one of the older gentleman our class with tears in his eyes just saying you know\nNever stuck to anything in my life and and I'm doing this and it's working I'm seeing I'm going to follow this for a while just it blesses you and your name and now it's more than the facts the figures in the math\nIt it's really changing lives I I Wish we could put our Congress through you know they need it [laughter]\n[laughter] wow you guys are fun this is great so uh what kind of ... was the Ninety eight pounds\nAll done that it was a credit cards cars and the student loans loans are the most in our one\nDeath that you hated and when you got rid of that you went to people\nMy student loan I yeah I had it so long it would have been in middle school that I had this little and\nShe fell on me when I finally click to pay this off but and I was just like I I Can't believe that it just gone just gone\nGood yeah wow so when somebody is new to the class and they're like I don't know this ... stuff what kind of like\nYou were kind of feels weird or this budget stuff feels weird or what do you tell them the main thing they have to do if they want to get out of that I got to do these two things are these three things what do you tell them\nAnd I would say that it really sets for success for the rest of it really even just step one ...

June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve\nIn America the consumer debt was three point eight seven trillion dollars oh that's a lot of debt or to the point that some Americans responded to a survey from my bank tracker\nAnd it's a small percentage but when you look at the total amount of Americans is going to blow your mind and here are the basic freedoms here me when I say this folks basic freedoms that these people were willing to forgo if their debt would be wiped clean or reading I Can't live here we go [laughter] [noise]\nTwo point four percent of Americans that's about six million Americans\nGet don't they present it let's see like ... million so that they again six million ... million Americans said\nThey would be willing to give up their freedom of speech if

I don't want to sacrifice going out and I thought of that sacrifice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch I don't want to sacrifice my F. two fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nOr I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt today Ramsey spaceships and so all plant I Want to go to jail I'll go to jail\nBefore that ... or ... or a three point five million dollars you have not heard of the baby sat there that are they just truly I've lost all hope that they will never ever ever ever got out of it\nYou just hit the point they've lost out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any data\nThat 'cause they ... I I Want to believe in my the glass as half full cut that there is one giant glass as half full up that's not right yeah well I have full I got to ask George again without opinion what do you think about that in the lobby\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and look to the sky shit I what I Want to believe in my optimistic view\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and looked\nAt this guy or should I what I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes that three point five million Americans is is an optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle you can make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time\nAnd pay off that that is but the sad thing is that they I'd rather that they've just lost hope they don't think\nYou're ... you're exactly right I Hope that someone now I think someone doesn't say I would rather not I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable in jail [noise] no I don't think so too\nI think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the fourth day Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff but the reality is if you're joining show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you give up your basic ...\nWe've got a plan it's called Dave baby steps total money make over walk she threw it join the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcased every day on the show do their different scream\nWell and on this show and the right to Chris shall we always had a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... you're listening to what you it's it's everyday\nAmerican because if people don't make crazy and ... they don't have like a super being Cape like no these are everyday people choosing something different this room and that's that you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the power in it but again anyone out there you can do is\nDrinks doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone number that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line in Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[noise] hey how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm looking I going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't at school [noise] we owe a hundred K. on her housework is free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby and the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and worked fulltime through high school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program and totality um but just prerequisites and and I could not work for the three years\nAnd the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a ... make fifty one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answered just because there is a vantage isn't disadvantages to [noise] um I don't think that would take away your name over right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step or what do you call it ... T\n... nurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that through your program enjoy fame prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may pay your house off in that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine\nYeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can't you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to cash 'em all that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to casual your way through that ultimate role\n\nI really know what are you making now ...\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically ... a year with that and how much does that school costs again you said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K\nTotal and the other one is nine thousand\nYeah correct so you could do it just started bumper salary honestly\nAnd go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back and a year so yeah Ken's right if you do that I Know ... and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do than the other school right now like you said 'cause you don't the cash for it so now don't go into student loan debt for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade by early and you enjoy the warning offense that's an increase in income at least and yeah and then move into the school and a few years and cash flow that you know that ...\nWant you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven [noise]\nYou can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I said because\nYes but guess what eight years from now you're thirty seven\nYou can cash flow your way so I think it's both than that's what I said because both of them are what you want to do also or something if you're good\nFolks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day room to show don't go anywhere [noise]\nAre you one of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts\nAnd so go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches some places that will have\nPeople and families that need this specific health that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time kind of build up your book of business I mean that financial coach but it's totally doable and to make that money for sure and salad I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plan or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach you mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's right well I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd and at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number of Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we\nCan um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I just found in the last few years that on\nA time for me to look for something else I'm On the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it um yeah I can collect my retirement um if I retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going all thirty five years of my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband that's a good idea\nBecause it would be a bit of a difference and they are but there is about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can\nMake that um I I really get excited thinking on helping people find Hong thing thirty and I find that really interesting okay not what I Love my teaching them but it's just time for it\nI get it I got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay\n[laughter] so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out\nAnd so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role of teacher before you retire without penalty\nFor five years\nI just want to throw scenario what is over the next five years you built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of ... but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just\nPlace if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nWell that's a it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how those when people are working so that means it is night than it is we get that thought what the busiest time and so\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can whatever it is that we're in commit the amount of time and if you start to the herself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're about great residents say they drink 'cause most people do great when they\nHave great people ... sounds like you to get really so\nEven though you're there's yeah I think you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever you and your husband decide ah and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent here and I think about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you lake basically like how much you work how many how you sell\nSuper fun versus going from where we're at the salary of the teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year he's ...\nAnd I think once you show the hubby replaces the twenty five cents for

three\nStory on the Arizona daily download it made me fattening\nAnd they've got anger and revenge on their mind and you know it's kind of like I'm going to use force and violence to get people's attention\nIs the way this about attention though I mean what ... ... talk about the actual\n... instead of taking a gun and trying to shoot somebody we know that a knife is more personal a gun is a little bit more removed or what is a pipe bomb say up or if you're doing a profile what does a pipe bomb say and the fact that it was a coordinated effort to get them to these people in like a couple of days of each other\nIt well it tells you that he or she has no desire to confront people and my guess is the personality type would be their property introverted or angry\nOr am I suspect people around them have heard them ventilate about what's going on um with\nThe quote unquote Democrats or your comment about it is he aligned with the president my guess is at least on a number of issues he probably is a ... again based on his are alleged to ... or as potential victims\nShow I think that\nYou know all that sort of goes into\nMaybe how do you catch this guy and I think the combination of whatever you can find off the bomb is it a bomb they've seen before\nUm where did the bombs go into the males stream than other words what post office did they go through um how does the secret service having their database of people who have sent threatening communications or or just on their radar for safety reasons or because of all the protect these they have from former to\nCurrent president's so\nMy guess is he's going to get caught 'cause it just seems that way too and sophisticated for that not to be the case\nRed berets are just ABC News crime and terror analyst a former up your special agent we're talking about bombs being sent to the Clintons the Obamas other Democrats to CNN Brett how easy\nIs it to mail a bomb to Bill Clinton or Barack Obama that can't be easy to do and it can't I mean there is the author shouldn't be they have to check Batman one is like is that what happened so that the the whatever was didn't get to where it was supposed to\nOf course is a meal and it's quite easy I have to walk to the post office and put the put whatever postage now you know that's an interesting thing that I just thought of is that apparently some of these packages had accept excess postage on it in other words like the guy had\nPostage now you know that's an interesting thing that\nI just thought of as apparently some of these packages had except excess postage on it in other words like the guy had played stamps on it and so [laughter] so what does that tell you about him you know I don't know what's he trying to avoid maybe walking into a post office will have to you know have to say but to go to your point that\nObviously current president's but former presidents have Secret Service details and literally all of their male doesn't come to them it goes to an off site and it's great\nIncluding early in the case of the Clintons and the Obamas\nOffsite caught the bomb in it never got any further than that so you know you're not you can you come up with their addresses will that will be easy enough\nOkay a buddy to get it to get it in their hands almost impossible\n... exactly and I think almost almost impossible because they all know that we're not going to open anything they got it\nRight there and help but he's going to be able to send them a Christmas card in our personally going to open up a Christmas card desperate so maybe this guy who wanted to do this knew it wasn't going to get there he's sending the message but also the timing of this were less than two weeks away from the mid term spread that had to go to this right\nI think so I think he is trying to send a message that this can happen to you if you think like these folks do now as a logical as that sounds you know is is this behavior change your opinion my opinion though that the point being is that you know he feels like\nThat going after people in a very violent way will make a point that the big takeaway from this in my view\nIs the word intolerance because this had this sort of goes to just not being tolerant of how other people think and unfortunately that seemed to be on the rise in this country\nIf you're the FBI do you send out some kind of memo or tell law enforcement\nOr don't have a democratic governor don't have a democratic uh attorney general don't have anybody in power who's a Democrat open their mail\nIs it that series on a street across the country or higher up like Nancy Pelosi don't touch anything Chuck Schumer don't touch anything what is the level of alert that the FBI has to get this out to higher up Democrats\nI think until he's caught a fairly high I think what you'll see now the Congress than if you send it to them it's got to get\nIs it's going to get scanned anyway right all male right there was thrown off site before it ever gets to the capital you send it to their home and California or wherever they live my guess is that they also get screened some form or fashion that yes you are right\nThat it's sort of puts people on lotus that until this guy gets a sound that they could be a potential target\nBrad Garrett ABC News crime and terror analysts former FBI special agent brat as always thanks for the insight we appreciate it take care guys\nNobody better than brat on this stuff I mean he knows\nWhat goes into things like this crime and terrorism if people do this why did they do it can they catch this guy so we're going to be on this breaking story all day will let you know exactly what's happening but bombs being sent to the Clintons in Obama's and others and obviously a coordinated effort no doubt
