that they should uh go after and and and and to me I I hear more and more of it they ratcheted up this past this entire fight with Kavanaugh was ratcheted up thing where you could see it\nWhen we lost the civil the civility\nAmongst each other to have conversations have even a conversation about something\nEverything is a debate everything is a fight\nYou show up ready to fight and I I I didn't

encouraging that volunteer ever okay [noise]\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to resolve things\nNo it's not but that is I think what we're headed to and Rand Paul's right both sides\nNeed to take it down a notch I'm looking at the Republicans I'm looking at the Democrats we've got to have some civility and the fight that they think they're taking on you understand it for a lot of them and we've talked about this before here\nWhich is you go on these shows and you you scream and yell at each other in the back\nA green room there you're talking about hey what are you doing this weekend as your kids you know the whole nine yards the problem is not everybody buys into that a lot of them they take it seriously a lot of them look at this WWE Shakespearean kind of cedar that's going on when politics and they buy into it and they take it seriously and I'm starting to think that more and more of\nThese people and I'm not talking about the the average person I'm Talking to more of the board of the people that represent us are starting to drink their own Kool Aid and are more than just rabble rousing their bases that they're starting to believe some of this stuff and what is it going to take for us to step back and go okay wait a minute this has gone too far\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up the conversation those who are actually got thing getting their face they realize that they bear some responsibility of this old extra power\nYeah let me ask you this let's just say for the sake of argument right that somebody goes out and does something from either side of the aisle\nOut of the aisle that says something that that energizes enough people that they go out and they do something right they killed somebody you think at any point in time that any of these people are gonna look though you know what maybe\nMaybe maybe we may maybe this is a little too much maybe maybe we need to step this thing that I don't know if it's going to happen that way you know one of the things I said is when I watched that whole thing with Jeff Flake and and several of these other\nSenators and stuff for people coming up and screaming getting into their faces I thought to myself\nDidn't we just have an issue with ... and the shooting and it just seems way too easy for somebody to walk up to some of these people and the anger that they had and it's a very interesting situation but civility we need more of it\nAnd I don't think we have it and I think some of the stuff that I talk about ah with people is they are worried about the tribalism in this country they are worried about the way that the country's headed they are worried about how we're talking to one another they're worried that the tools that we have that should be fun and enjoyable\nHave now become tools we can go after each other Twitter Facebook all these things say horrible horrible things to each other with zero accountability and zero worry for anybody coming after you\nAnd that to me is not good it's not this mob mentality and mob rule is not good for anybody and it sure now not good for the next generation\nBut I agree with him I think somebody's going to pay the price the ultimate price somebody is going to be so pissed so angry so enraged by something and the fires are going to be stoked\nTo the point that they act on something and that they do something as if they kill a politician\nAnd we're like wow but it shouldn't be a surprise it shouldn't based on all the things we're

I have never seen anything that indicates that carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move twenty miles from there and sort of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper\nBut I'm the numbers are giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever I'm going to continue to shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you mentioned the ballot out pan back a little bit and dial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get\nYou you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall to carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents than Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that um I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen the indicates that\nThe you know one end of North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other and now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but\nThat's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you're looking at different end of town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of scary and let's see where we are at that point um\nBut I don't think you can uh what your your numbers just don't work hey thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon

of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you in\nThe heritage and it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it there or a ball they never live up to the expectations the resorts set and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally I'm forever is with timeshare exit team\nWe want to start or mirrors off rights or we want to sort of getting the same page for ... or ... or what have you with a sort of what our future was\n... so how Allen actually had a when we met he had already paid off all his school loans and had a lot of the evenings and I'm like hey you want to get married I've got a hundred and fifty five thousand that you\nKnow I think I really don't see doing that I'm On a minute ago yeah\nYeah and our church I'm at the time was offering it for you and so I was like oh we need to go to this class because I'm terrified and I don't know what to do and\nI'm so we did that in that was in two thousand twelve where she did that while we were engaged and so we got married August twenty twelve and so\nTo this day you know before we got married we had our budget ready to go on the spreadsheet ... from the nerd and uh [laughter] to this day we can tell you every penny we spent since the day when I got married so that's been that's been an interesting journey but definitely a blessing\nOf a new one month later ... things done yeah so what do you tell people what key to getting out of bed as well\nGosh all sorts of communication or whether it's we're married are engaged for years by yourself you you need someone to talk about it um and then it's setting the budget discipline on it there's no problem changing the budget but it's just it's actually spending every since and figure out where it goes in the ... just going to do it\nOh yeah we've gotten very good at 'em cash flowing things there's been a lot of and of course over six years a lot of unexpected expenses\nThem and we always say that if it weren't for the budget than we wouldn't know where to get money from ... um we've actually catch loads three cars in the span of time um and then about two years ago we um\nWe we were having some trouble I'm getting pregnant which you never think that that's going to happen and um\nYou know fertility stuff isn't really yeah it's not like getting cancer it's not like a medical emergency or anything but it's definitely a very stressful um and so we we were very glad to be able to have the\nFunds and know where to pull money from and we actually ended up doing two rounds of IDF which was very expensive um and so we're happy to finally be pregnant\n\nAnd we're not going to call her day so [laughter]\nWe just you know going through the stress of that and I see I've seen plenty of friends go through that or want to adopt and not be able to because they don't have the money or they have to find rates for years and years and so we were just left to not not have to put that on hold because of money\nSo that was definitely a blessing\nBut beyond that I'm after I guess that would be bad\nAbout that but we blew them\nFor you guys yeah weld on we're very proud of your graduation who is your biggest cheerleader each other probably other than each other I think that's where we are going crazy ... rolling their

construction on now\nAnd that we are in the purpose of turning into a regular market but I didn't have a bad feeling about it and I'm thinking\nAbout it and wait until we can get another one without mortgage I just don't feel good about it okay but he he went the other end of it if I get that you know 'cause I'm a property manager\nHe said it's up to you\nBuddy bought it without talking to you\nOh no no he bought it we agree on line I mean it together and okay\nSo you agreed on the purchase and now you're thinking you don't want the debt\nExactly rather rent it twelve hundred and don't know if we tended to market to be four hundred and something\nMhm show how much will you owe on the property\n... oh Ninety two thousand [noise]\nThen you have a four hundred dollar mortgage\nA four

debt\nIs um and now we can probably make about ten or Fifteen Eli outright but you know when we do the math and we can make that and you know two or three years with collecting rent but not really

on the line and it's our\nJob welcome to the day Ramsey shows\nHave thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife and I have a ... a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you and\nWhat we've only got about two hundred and Fifteen hours ago 'cause we have our mortgage oil three rental property that we have mortgages on and and those two and a half years we've had a little graduate high school or college we've been paying about half the tuition all he's taking out loans for the other half and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and I mean if I've got a beginner baby steps say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nDoing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income\nAbout a hundred thousand okay\nSo can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd stop the studios\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental properties as we've been for the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers\nThat are going to be going to college to hear a lecture years\nWell ... maybe some four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which human or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nYeah which is stupid\nIn an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a for three maybe four month emergency fund them then yep\nAnd then and then let them stop taking off student loans\nAnd clear him out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounded like a rental are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still they're\nFamine houses tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a moral fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen ... yeah yeah and for one is only one only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now and that was going to feel good and my son has do I take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimum ... and take her college without that first once we got college without that\nThen we find money we throw enough to have to probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about first we're getting back on the oil and K. or not\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency\nFund is maybe step three and then baby step forwards Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it up the rentals in the house\nAt your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then of course money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages ... is that so there's still a prioritization even though it's ... it's not logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before skipping tree for two and three I guess technically\nYou're given five are skipping filing yeah yeah\nYeah and you had any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're\nOn our loyal what's your back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling in a ... with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHi Mr Ramsey it's an honor\nTo talk to you how can I don't quite often for ya okay um\nWe had our house currently on the market right now the lifted it in July for two teams [noise] um I Know there is not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise]\nUm [noise] what are struggling with here we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine [laughter] good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that occasion because it's on lake we're on water on a on a stream but um our military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know so you're not in out in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast ... your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yeah\nThe I mean three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than a is there\nAnyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is or a a real her up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere the kind of\nSpecializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives or that just not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these it it's so rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay I mean kids you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promising a you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at it\nThey're looking at it on\nLine all their workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they're just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was I walked away there were not client's\nLocation Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his thought for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer where mouse to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean why pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and just gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe\nAt under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel I'm Down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nAnd they and they don't have a central Meyer stores you need to it's a very unique\nSome rules ... situation oh I'm Sorry\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nTheft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed\nAnd when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were at the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nMe wasn't that way on one of those that\nI was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France ha ha ha or a heart beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force anyone would

getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show and and so we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with the legs that kind of stuff\nWith the income you've got no debt you can do anything you wanted to them and you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to ... and it's not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so right man it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nA family member he's doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm

thing\nBecause you know we told you weeks ago the convention center [noise]\nUm [noise] boy it sounded like Trump really wanted to come to town and the Phoenix convention center said were books and then we looked at\nWhat was booked and there was nothing book nothing on the low maintenance yeah it it made you lead you to believe that the Phoenix invention center a doesn't like Trump and his politics or that's not necessarily to be\nA they don't want the headache for the last time but I don't know if Trump needs to come here and I've said it before I don't think Nick's Sally running for

to smile and when I had these kids I don't want to I Want to be able to tell people hey this is where to go donate stuff\nI don't I I when I was there for probably an hour this morning I saw probably five different people walk in with the doors opened the gates open and they said I'm here to volunteer and they have people just walking in and they really and they say I'm from this church I heard about you and I I Want to I Want to drop off the case of water I Want to donate this but\nI went live during the twelve o'clock expansion today after I did my story on this\nWe had four or five calls and they said what I did was I didn't catch the name of the church can you tell me that again\nI don't want to donate this the churches and so on the church want to watch that show up and accept or can they not handle the influx of opening a bunch of people dropping off I I don't think\nThey want to publicize it I think that they that this is just my take on listening to what you're saying don't they're not going to publicize their thinking some people will come by drop off a donation maybe the people to go to this church can chip and is there going to look\nAt the beginning of my interview with pastors you're on James he told me\nAt first we didn't want to do stories on this these people's lives there and a fragile stay but then when it got to this point he was like ... we can't tonight

someone with forty\nRight okay let me ask you this will information about what they need to be posted on our website if people want to help can they go to our website and will there be a list of things they need or again do they just you know we just don't we don't want an influx of people donating stuff\nI'm not sure if there's a list of donations that are needed but there is a story on Katie A. R. dot com from what ... and I went and we interviewed this morning so I Know that information at all can hurt you will be on our ... dot com I'm not sure if the donations is their right but I can I can contact the pastor and weaken up they've got on ... dot com\nOh us pastor dreams if they're gonna start turning people way because they simply can't take it anymore\nNo that that won't they won't

delayed their buses were cancelled because of the hurricane so but um he did say that they're hearing more buses will be coming\nAnd how many people how many how how often do they say like a night or to or is it for a week\nHe said this is this it's never been this long so from my understanding is probably a day or two and it's when someone can get in contact with family but a lot of these people didn't even they didn't even talk to their family for a week and they weren't even aware that they've already made it here or there out of the detention centers\nAlright ... reporter spoke to a pastor
