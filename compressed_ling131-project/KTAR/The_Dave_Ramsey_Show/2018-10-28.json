the Stanley Cup last year\nGot within a game of going to the Stanley Cup two years before that made it to the Stanley Cup the year before that for the most part they've kept the core of those three teams and then they've added some pieces to it and the coyote beat them seven to one so there you go a couple of short handed goals when did you expect anything else this was one of the\nLeast conventional hockey games have seen in a long time for a lot of reasons not so much that the coyotes were able to beat Tampa Bay I I think for the most part a lot of the things that have been outlined on this show to the first ten games of the season\nAre being proven to come true\nI mean there was certainly reason for concern after the first four games in the coyotes had only scored in one of those four games and were there for one and three but the defense was great\nThe defense has been great through these first ten games the penalty killing has been unbelievable to the first ten games the penalty killers score and more than they give up goals the goal tending has been very good to great pretty much all of these first ten games\nSo as we said four games into the season when the cavities weren't scoring everything else they're doing is right to just keep doing what you're doing and when the ... start to go in you're going to see a very quick turn around and that is absolutely what we saw tonight it's what we've seen now over these last five games really\nI mean if you look at the first five games the coyote scored\nFour goals menu for counting the the third goal in the in the shootout as a goal to county scored four goals in the first five games but they didn't\nThat only shows up on the actual score sheet but not in the stats so really the ... put the puck and the other teams net three times in the first five games and now when the second five games but they're still playing the same defense goal tending ... entitled to kill it change any of that but they've scored twenty two goals\nAnd the next five games so we've seen the two extremes they're not a team that's going to score three goes over five games they're not they're not that week off and simply they're probably not going to be the best off ants and hockey either the scoring twenty two goals over five games\nBut what is standing out to me the most about the coyotes and I said this a couple of times now but we're we're a chunk of the way into the season now we're we've gotten through one of those ten game segments so it was a little bit more water now\nA couple of times now but we're we're a chunk of the way into the season now we're we've gotten through one of those ten game segments sowed it holds a little bit more water now the defense the look better in the second half last year that on paper should have been one of the better ones and hockey this year with everybody coming back\nI'm a coyote habit one nothing really short delay with this first goal is the coyote as a black

have to stick around to the second half of the show because I'm not gonna tell you now but I'll tell you it is well worth sticking around for him I guess in the first half in in the final segment of the show all around troublemaker and attorney Tom Ryan welcome back\nDr Mike thanks for having me back well I you just hot off the presses or this or two days ago the\nSupreme Court ah had ruled on the invested in the ad proposition that was the one that was going to provide funding for education\nBy some alterations in the tax rates particularly if they high very high end of the income scale\nAnd they issued a very short ruling saying the way they came down which is to toss that proposition off the ballot and are they held off on issuing the full opinion that full opinion is now issued take it from the top of what happened here well\nFirst off the name of the cases malaria versus Reagan Jaime ... is a well known um education a lobbyist former a superintendent public instruction looking and ah they sued a show Reagan but not because she did anything wrong be sued her and her official capacity of secretaries of state\nOr the real partying interest was the invested a education committee\nWhich was I proposition that was I was passed around and God do you recall how many signatures there was hundreds\nOf thousands always well over two hundred thousand yeah uh the problem is for the invest in education committee had nothing to do with the amount of signatures the numbers they got they had plenty of signatures to get on the ballot correct\nUm your state legislature has done a lot to um got the Arizona constitutions beers on the constitution was passed in Nineteen ten in during the progressive era one of the things that did was reserved a lot of power to the people to do something called initiative and that's where\nWe'll pass laws people pass laws and they can amend the constitution\nUm because that's a power reserved to the people are are Supreme Court has historically traditionally said look uh just substantial compliance has all but it's required were not required perfection\nDecision in perfect substantial ...\nCompliance is what I think any reasonable person say hey this is perfectly clear what it means correct well it you know if it if there was a mistake here are mistake there is not about the Marjah size than the margin ... minor technical correct stuff correct stuff that keeps your crew employed lawyer [laughter]\nUnfortunately yes but here's the here's the problem because this now fundamentally changes at sea so there are two parts when you're doing an issue of\nThe top part just says hey this is a general description if you want to know the specifics it's attached to the petition\nAre traditionally in the past we said look that initial description as long as it's a hundred words or less you can't describe the whole big long and some would describe a twenty page document and a hundred words\nLook that initial description as long as it's a hundred words or less you can't describe the whole big long answer to describe a twenty page document and a hundred words exactly and and that would be perfect or have it be a comprehensive but our Supreme Court has now changed that rule it has to be perfect that's what this five to ruling means\nWe've decided that we will not tax any services correct\nIf you can in every expert in tax policy says what you want to have is the lowest possible taxes and to get that you need to have the broadest possible base our whole society has moved increasingly towards services\nAnd all of that they're massive exemptions from our sales taxes that are put in by special interests to say I don't want to get tax I don't want to get tax what this proposition if it's passed would do would present prevent the legislature or the people at any point in the future\nFrom saying I Would like a lower sales tax but we need them maybe we should ... nobody has ever going to say tax healthcare but you know what I get massages maybe it's it's a it's a luxury maybe I should pay a sales tax on that maybe there's some others and the effect of that\nIs to lower others sales tax and we have the most kind of fiscally students the legislature on the face of the year you know nobody is gonna overall raised taxes overall right\nBut to have a more rational system maybe we can lower the sales tax and have a broader base let me tell you who is in who is in\nFavor of killing this one who's against it Steve Farley ran for governor ... governor reducing Garcia\nAmericans for prosperity that is the Koch brothers so who is against this liberals moderates and conservatives who is in favor of this\nThey're real estate agents who are trying to preemptively create a situation where the exemption that they currently get from sales taxes might get tinkered with at some point in the future phony phony arguments agreed agreed agreed\nOkay move on other one is we're short short time here other other where you can vote on which one's worse\nProposition three oh six says no money for political parties they'll prevent\nA candidate's from giving leftover funds are buying services from political parties you know what\nNobody's against precluding that but then you read the fine print\nThe voters of Arizona passed many years ago a clean elections commission to have some public funding\nTo have regulation of campaigns by a truly independent political party here's the small print in that proposition ... independent commission right independent commission yes\nThe small print would put the so called independent or election commission under the complete and total political control of the governor in other words it is the end\nOf the independent commission it would do exactly the opposite of what the voters of Arizona intended which is there should be a commission that says free from political process as humanly they don't report to the governor they don't report to\nAny Democrat or any Republican their commission where no party can have a majority you have to have an independent on there\nAnd uh you know equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans this is the guarding of clean elections by the way the other thing they said about not giving money to their parties at with leftovers but hey you can debate I neither here nor there on that and\nGo ahead they just added that the Republicans just added that now they're taking it away as a boy we're really giving you something they're the ones that added that in in ... and there's nothing that would keep the legislature from doing that in the future or keep this commission it is it is a complete destruction now question for you [laughter]\nWhat these are pretty bad if you want to say more about this ... ... yeah let me just tell you this really brief you've asked me to vote I vote on three oh six as the the number one bad a bad proposition\nBecause it is the biggest fraud and I'm I'm not just screaming with your your analysis on the the the one twenty six but here's the deal Arizona's had a really good\nThis is the biggest fraud and I'm I'm not disagreeing with your your analysis on the the the one twenty six but here's the deal Arizona's had a really good independence streak we've got the independent redistricting commission we have merits selection of judges and we had the ... elections commission all of those things\nHave so many of those things are absolute national models that people have a ... a national level who studied good government by the way every single one of those things was put in by voted the people not by the legislature because they're trying to deal with the legalized bribery and\nCorruption that the legislature continues to pass [noise]\nThat's why we have the independent ... here's the thing when we pass that independent commission there was a huge huge public discussion what\nWhat I Am scared to death about this one is that this thing will pass and people who have no idea what they just passed rather they're they're calling it something completely different from when it is we returned thinking just a minute one of the most interesting

uh educational um inequities it widens that gap\nIt it essentially makes this idea of choice which is the narrative that they use its not choice it gives an option for those wealthier a family's already have the resources to send their kid to private school now on the backs of taxpayers using a taxpayer funded discount\nAnd those kids were in the title one schools in the schools that may not be performing well they're not going to be able to afford the private school regardless and now they're school has been further gutted of public education\nBecause the voucher money comes out of the exactly and this is\nTaxpayer money we're paying as taxpayers for families to send their kids to private school now look if you want to send your child to a private parochial school more power to you but that should not be paid for by the taxpayers\nAnd we have to invest our public schools that's where the vast majority of our children go to school that's like that the hub of great innovative teaching a skills and resources let's make that the school in the community that every kid wants to go to\nOkay gotta move on I I Want to get to the subject of of medicine and health\nCare and apologized for this one but I've got to ask the question because it seems to be addressing argue a real doctor I Am\nPeriod wealth of this week a slew of here I got John Ryan in in here with me and he sent me the Web page and and I will tell you what are what I found a ... with the board of medical examiners a U. R. A. N. D. because I Know sometimes there's that well it ... or something like whatever you're an MD\nAnd you interned at the University of Michigan I did my residency at\nThe University of Michigan is a distinction right I I stand corrected but my point is\nAre some knowledge or the hierarchy of educational institutions in the University of Michigan is the uh one of the premier institutions in the country am I talking to a Wolverine uh I did a postcard\nWill go but the but the absolutely a earrings look I I I also I did for it I looked on the other day we left go has a BA from the University of from a\nUniversity of Wisconsin Madison mhm a highly reputable institution not quite at the level of Michigan but close\nIf you have a if you're with a big employer that has a group policy you're trying to get paid for but if it's expensive it's costing you more than you think 'cause it should and your employers paying for that but that's money you probably would have gotten salary\nBut the folks who don't have that who have pre existing conditions and don't have a big group health care plan\nHow to de get coverage because they are real expensive\nTo right right so and I appreciate your bringing us up because this is definitely one of the main reasons I decided to run is because of health care\nAnd as a physician as a licensed physician or in the state of Arizona a look I'm I understand health care policy very well and and having worked in emergency department that was the final comment pathway that's where people came when they did not have access to health care\nAnd the thing is we've been paying for that medical care all along because those people came they could not pay 'cause I didn't have insurance that costs go somewhere eventually gets absorbed by the insurance companies and our premiums go up to pay for it so it's very important that we have the individual mandate in place\nTo keep health care costs down because we have to have healthy young folks in the risk pool along with the older folks who use more resources now it's\nAn insurance plan of produced well yeah absolutely the bug of the ... word there is mandate Americans don't like mandates for it\nSo now it's an insurance plan of for just one yeah absolutely the bug of the ... word there is mandate Americans don't like mandates for anything\nWhat is that and why is it important\nWell like I said it really it it evens out our risk pool and frankly it's an ... so it makes cos it brings costs down because it allows you to manage having folks that are on the sticker end of the spectrum but more importantly\nLet's talk about some personal responsibility if you don't have insurance you're still going to get the care when you need it but somebody else who's going to pay for it\nSo I Believe that everybody should have skin in the game everybody should have their insurance otherwise\nIt it just doesn't work that's just I mean look we have insurance for our cars right to protect ourselves and the person that we may have a collision with you have to have health insurance because ultimately somebody else is going to pay for your care\nI'm so on top of it though as far as we're talking about pre existing conditions look almost two point eight million Arizona's have pre existing conditions and a million of those are folks that are under the age of Eighteen children and then people approaching retirement fifty five to sixty four who are not yet on Medicare\nThey are relying on not being penalize for their preexisting conditions\nAnd it is it it is unbelievable that in the last few days that our current administration has offered to basically allow\nA company has to go the protections and put out these short term junk plans because what that does is it a centrally by for case our entire insurance system it gives one pathway to the younger healthier people they end up getting these junk plans which really don't cover them for regular things and it puts pocket money in the pockets of the insurance companies in the meantime the rest of us\nAnd I have a pre existing condition I really honestly don't know a lot of people who don't or whose families don't have some company and their\nFuneral for somebody in there is over fifty is all ... and like I said there's a lot of kids a lot of trial do you convince the younger people\nAnd they see this policy for a hundred bucks a month or something like that and they think they're buying real coverage and they think they can't afford the one that's a little more because they think they can't but they don't find out that it doesn't cover anything until they get sick and then it's like how how do you how do you convince\nThe education you have to educate them and look it's a they have to kind of sometimes catastrophic coverage but they don't have coverage for preventative measures they can't go on for a regular well check they can't go in for you know routine vaccinations\nI mean our goal should be to keep people healthy rather than just jump in once they're very sick so that's why it's really important to have comprehensive coverage and and actually have this essential health health care benefits that are fully covered and you're in\nCharge of you know more than thirty seconds to conclude hurdle to dripping any candidate for Congress look I Am so\nProud to have a chance to represent the eight

I'm I'm not really following you how to how would he not get a domestic terrorism charge if he if he just did it because he didn't like how do you prove if he sent all these bombs to all Democrats all people who've criticized or don't like Donald Trump how do you how would he not be charged with domestic terrorism I don't get that\n... they may not have the evidence to meet the elements of that crime yet oh I'm In right now\nRight we've got right now we got a fingerprint we've got DNA on these devices or ... well on these packages and or devices I mean so unclear which which are where it's coming from but he's attached to those packages and devices so right there you have him\nWith with a good evidence that ties into those charged with regards to those devices explosive material\nRoof two for one one nine to treat to find out that the best kind of rules you can have\nIs a dry roof from ...

I worked with and the furious school district\nOne of them had been with the district for Seventeen years and she was only making a dollar more than minimum wage at eleven dollars and Seventy cents an hour ... those are often working with our students with disabilities\nOne of those students with someone with a developmental disability who wheelchair bound had a vision impairments she needed a lot of therapies and support and the ... it's almost like a nurse you require that high level of training to be meeting their medical needs and the class and making making sure they can navigate the schools\nAnd to be only paid for that person eleven dollars and Seventy cents or ... percent\nAt minimum wage at ten dollars and fifty cents as unacceptable\nSo so what I'm hearing is you can't really fix\nThe class size until you fix the teacher shortage Frank Rick ... wrecked it reducing class sizes can be one of the priorities of R. K. twelve funding at going forward okay I mean what we have to acknowledge is that Governor do see in the Republican majorities in the legislature and the voters through approval to prop one two three have increased funding\nFor K. twelve education in in Arizona by two points seven billion dollars over the last four years by the way gentleman that is the largest percentage increase Thirteen point six percent of any of the ten states that didn't raise taxes in that same time period\nBut reducing class sizes can be a priority that gave us was question it's a great one I Want to cap class sizes at no more than twenty students in grades K through too so that we can put much more focus on early childhood literacy\nAnd address this gaping achievement gap that we have in the state now with fifty six percent of our third graders failing to score proficient on the state standardized test in reading the foundation of all learning in their native language so we know we have a huge achievement gap and we have to address it on the front in the early childhood education and literacy\nAll right let's take a break we are with the uh the two candidates for the school superintendent position in the election for the state of Arizona Kathy Hoffman is the Democrat Frank Riggs is the Republican when we come back\nA big issue that we have to talk about is the resource officer school resource officers globally safety yeah we'll get into that next\nGay does best of our the A R needed Ninety two three of them\nHave you noticed a change in your vision or bright images stole or your glasses not keeping things in focus\nLet's face it if you're getting older you might have cataracts now for the good news with many new advancements and cataract surgery the doctors at southwestern center can give you back the quality of vision you expect to continue your active lifestyle\nThere's nothing to fear and most patients agree the procedure is easier than expected so go to ask W.
