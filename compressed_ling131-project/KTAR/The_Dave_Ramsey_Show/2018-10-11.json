how well prepared and how amazing is when you look around the country and the globe and their incidents where there's an earthquake or something ah and and how we the west\nModern times and in certain places around the globe and uh we handle things in ways that just other countries don't I think it's it is it is really amazing speaking of handling things again we're moving towards the midterms\nHealth care and the cost of healthcare it's been ignored and it's driving me crazy that all of these things and today\nTrump did something that that I like I absolutely again I you know what he drives me crazy at times but I'm an action person when you put the ... you start to do things that you show action and he's keeping some of his promise to some of them like some of my head but\nHe's doing what I I think he's trying to do some stuff that's real and I think he's taking on these drug companies in a way that they've not seen before\nTwo new laws will remove a gag order preventing pharmacist from telling you how to pay lower prices on prescription drugs that silence forest fires from health insurance companies which sometimes inflated the prices and pocket the difference is the cost of doing business President Trump says no more\nThis gives people knowledge as to prices have different locations\nDrug insurers so you those gag order price contracts were rare farmers who say they aren't\nYeah yeah of course they're going to say it's rare but\nI like this and this is something that won't be talked about he's not going to get the credit for\nBut the rising cost of health care as we had in two thousand Nineteen people trying to figure out how they roll enroll for this that and the other and they're looking at prices in sticker shock is coming again and ... this Congress has done very little to sort any of this stuff out\nAnd it needs to be sorted out and drug issues when you talk to a lot of people\nDrug prices because it is an ongoing thing a lot of ways is the stuff that thinks people it is yes massive heart attack cancer things like that but it's the other stuff on on the on the massive side of things that is the day to day in month a month for the masses\nThat is a real struggle for people and if you if we can get to this point we're starting to again competition is great if we start finding ways capitalistic ways to approach this thing I think we can totally do with this I think we can come at it in a way that hasn't been done before\nAnd it's not going to make everybody happy\nBut right now we have isn't working and it is going to be very interesting and I never begrudge the drug companies for making money because my my thing is you put the risk out there\nAnd the cost of doing business the cost of getting a drug through here and realized there's a lot of country a lot of our drugs around the globe are used they're not throwing up their money like we are cheaper elsewhere why is that well it's a game here\nThe price of prescription drugs way out of whack and way through I I've been talking about it for a long time long before\nI ever decided to run for president\nYeah yeah and and I think this is a a a good step but it's a first step but there's many other steps that need to be you know approached and looked at and I think we've got to start thinking outside the box I Do the Democrats won a single payer for for everybody and you know as how do we pay for that\nThat's the big thing how do we pay for that who else 'cause you're not going to get rid of the insurance companies\nSo how does that work who gets paid what how much does it cost everybody wears the value added tax gonna come to that that's going to be a national tax all of these kinds of things that are going to be thrown onto us there's ways that we can go about doing but if the Republicans don't start coming up with ideas of eventually\nThey're going to lose\nAnd their their hand is going to be forced and we're going to be like this

I'm Talking to India or maybe that's not the right way to get a ... I mean I became quote I'm chopped them when I'm Out in a long term commitment to it for\nA long\nTime uh I mean the the problem with short term investments says it's a very very hard\nUm you know short term investments magically savings account and it's going to pay you know one to two percent right now\nI'm you know and when you do long term investments in the new pulled them out short term as you said you can get the market could move down on you and you could actually lose some of the money so um if you want to position and some of it in long term investments with the idea\nThat the hope that we are going to make some more about the idea that we could actually lose some won't take some risk where some of that that's an okay thing to do um\nBut you know basically if you know you're going to need the money and the actual principals very important to you I you know there's not a ... intermediate investment that I'm comfortable with that I use a so I'm pretty much either putting it in a savings account or I'm investing it\nAnd sometimes I'm investing it knowing that I may or may only be in their year and it could be down in a year and but I'm going to take that risk just because that's money I can do that I have a little bit of um margin with meaning I can afford to lose a little bit of money\nAnd if that's the case then then it's okay but that that's what we're faced with the ... is in Minneapolis Hi Zack how are you\nAre you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise] [noise]\nHi I'm a I'm currently in college and I paid cash transfers master and I'm planning on joining the national guard\nBut I'm Wondering if I should continue going to college after I joined the national guard or if I should go back to my home town and just live with my parents that I'm basically getting paid to go to college\nOkay when you go back to your hometown live with your parents would go to a different college\nYeah I'd go to a university that's within twenty minutes of my parents' house\nAllergen okay if you don't go back home you would stay where you are obviously and you would um can you pay cash\n[noise] uh yeah if I were they were hiking I save the

freshman all she got three and a half years to go or whatever\nWell yeah and then I Am actually think laugh sophomore credit so I can graduate in two years\nAgo she got two years to go what are you

university this local or\nYeah just fate local university and not as um right now I'm at the University of Minnesota which is a lot bigger I guess too\nRight okay All right well um\nIf you actually get of the knowledge of the reputation of the school really doesn't matter much in Ninety nine percent of the jobs out there\nOkay if you actually get the knowledge now if the actual quality of the education is lower then that's a different discussion okay but\nI Would not stay someplace merely for its reputation [noise] there's other\nReasons that you want to stay in that location you like it there you want to stay in that area you you know you've enjoyed the\nUh the experience of being there and you're willing to work to pay for it if you can pay cash for it I'm OK either way\nThere's not

commission next summer so about ... about a year a lot\nLess than a year good so you can tread water till then an ad no more new debt that's a victory okay\nThen the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on their credit card just minimum wage and we'll call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nRight like like the kind of our money is and not have latched half credit card you know how to ... and it's a really really dumb idea of how you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards\nUm I Know you have caught them all up [laughter] yeah I don't use them I switched I don't care if you use them or not drop 'em up I'll\nStop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because they're my score agile and out of the infant probably make about an area where I'm located\nWell I a little more money I another thousand dollars a month to change your life uh-huh so that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income\nStrange hopefully with a new um with a new job in a new career at that

going on but I can tell you this just isn't the hidden the right way as it\nNo it's not so I'm going to give them my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary endings\nGay and in that chapter in one chapter in the book he says that when you end something a relationship with job business whatever it is when you in something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get better\nAnd that's when you end it right I mean if you if you've been where the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's gonna quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually has quitting this time\nAnd you you know you're married to a drunk you got to make a decision at that point right in your case in ... with this thing this thing's printing the wrong way you have to give me a logical if I knew\nYou and him when I look at this and say look at yourself in the mirror and say is there a logical reasonable good reason that says that that we can turn this thing around if we turn these three knobs and get this business working [noise]\nThen we have to change the business or something

their vote these these polls have been wrong in the past I don't know if you can take anything for granted early voting started yesterday ballots male people will be receiving them in the mail today\nI mean the reason yeah so do you use it over because the polls pretty much say your views over you're talking twelve sixteen Seventeen percent point Doug do see a head of Davy our sea uh so I think it's a fair question uh but if you're a politician the races never over and if you do see what it come on the air and say yeah I think it's over\nI'm going to chill out in the next couple of weeks you can't do it doesn't look very\nGood now you can't do that and he's right you can't become complacent you can't take a day off it's not over until every ballot is collected in county but that's a smart idea but\nBut we know they're ready to show that most ... most people smarter than I Do this for a living say on barring some October surprise barring something that comes way out of left field right David Garcia is not going to catch up anytime soon to the governor so it looks like they'll do see\nWill win but the governor has to say\nEvery day I got to keep moving I got to keep working it's not over yeah\nSo you know do she will will go all over Arizona I'm not really sure what David Garcia is doing these days except hanging out at a coffee shop with thirty people that was yesterday I don't know what good that does\nFor Sally talks about the new and\nAlright max explain the new get because you you put it you you put it into words perfectly\nOkay so you've got this male or that comes to your door comes to your mailbox and when you look at the front on the top it says it says here since cinema or will not keep Arizona State Mm and then you can turn it a little bit so it's a hologram and you see the lovely image of Phoenix the valley\nYou know turn into a mushroom cloud when you when you tilt it a little bit is an anti cinema\nGroup\nThat put the the mail or in your mailbox so Martha mix Sally the Republican running for Senate told Jim sharp today and Arizona's morning news\nI have nothing to do with that is right now and we're not even allowed to talk to them um so I mean and so I think instead of asking me about something that I have no responsibility of producing why don't people ask her about her record on these issues that she's trying to cover up\nOkay but then on the back and explain you know she was against Luke air force base she voted for the Iran deal which gave\nMoney to Iran by the way that was their money that we had kept since the seventies and but it's it's it's getting a lot of a lot of talk\nBecause you know certain voters will believe that\nYeah I mean what's with Sally supposed to say you know I I Do think that she could have come out stronger\nAnd not who booted she could have said hey listen this is a bad I you know I had nothing to do with it I don't know who put it out or we're not getting new no matter who wins the Senate race she could have said that she didn't read\nThe number three story on the only resented daily download who's winning the education right\nOkay so I'm Glad you took my advice and did not vote for a guy on Douglas or in the primary thank you\nSo that pops from champagne are we done with that\nWe ... that day so we got a new race it's Frank rigs he's the Republican Kathy Hoffman she's the Democrat we've had both in Studio and they're both running for state superintendent race so\nIf you look at the poll it says rigs forty four percent Hoffman thirty nine percent um\nI'm In about two weeks we will bring both of these individuals in Studio and weren't grew in both at the same time right and then we're going to let them yell at each other [laughter] that's what I Want to see a they got into it a little bit last night in a debate\nWhen you needed to go to the middle\nOf the smart who I'm Garcia to me bring in someone is a far left is polarizing as Bernie Sanders out here to some form an endorsement\nThat's a great point by the way you know he tilted more to the left what usually happens during an election campaign aides you start way far right or left\nAnd then you go toward the middle to make yourself more accessible to independent and moderate voters rights and David Garcia did the exact\nOpposite he needs the independent vote well now he's not talking to a voter because he's not doing any interviews or he's only going to friendly coffee shops that they're already there they're already going to vote for him because he ran your campaign the exact opposite of what it should have been and Bernie Sanders is expected to come out\nThat's going to more of the fringe not more of the modern now you\nJust go through the motions now you're like it now you're not doing tough interviews now now you're canceling on interviews you've already said you would do and now you're not doing it\nAnd the only thing it hurts is your campaign\nOr I'll be I'll be very honest I was interested in listening to David Garcia early in the ... election season about is educate young plan\nA you know governor do see a he he got to basically dragged to buy read for added to give teachers are raised and David Garcia is a guy who was supposed to be this education governor yeah but it's usually education gubernatorial candidate\nAnd he shows up and doesn't have a plan how are you an education your whole life and you can't figure out what your plan is other than raising taxes or other than\nI'm gonna ... gonna do that was taken all of a sea of Arizona votes this prop through and that's my plan\nRats horse crap that's a terrible plan this is just a bad bad campaign and I don't I don't have any bad feelings\nAgainst David Garcia but this guy doesn't have a clue how to campaign well in order to know that now he lost to die in Douglas right or in the state education race how Dion Douglas well Louis ... we know what's still rather than out are tying\nDouglas was awful she was terrible I mean we didn't know how badly must have been Garcia had an education background yeah he does he he could have went in and and and been a better right state superintendent right then Dion Douglas but you lose the dying Douglas and then you show up at the governor's race\nAnd you've got ... you don't want Mac this is why he doesn't want to\nTalk to us his he has no answers for anything what's your what's your education ... I don't know or are you going to raise taxes I don't want to talk about that because you know it's yes about the border do you want to open borders you said you wanted you know no wall I mean that's really where he lie and he kind of walk that back but you can't get over something like that when you\nSay something especially in the state you may be able to get away with that in California and Mexico you can't say\nEither no wall or open borders and abolish ice in this state and get elected as a Democrat look what curious and send them a headset here since cinema has said we need to revise or we need to redo the immigration play but she never says open borders no walls she has never gone down that\nRoad ever wonder why here since ... did not endorse David Garcia now you know why\nNow you get it now you get it\nBecause here's and send them a can't win a race if she says all that stuff\nSo how she can endorse a Democrat right does all that stuff right here since ... this is what I like about the Senate race the Senate race we have two qualified women\nNow you might you might ah you know like one better than the other you might not like the the the stance of of one over the other that kind of thing but I really do believe whoever wins the Senate race\nUm I think we will be able to say hey that's a proud representative from Arizona even though maybe you disagree with their stance in the gubernatorial race I mean what we now know I this was a joke yeah this race never even started\nOver the summer it was one or two points and do she was up and you were looking at each other saying well this could be really interesting right which was one of the reasons we wanted David Garcia on the show let's talk about education for me education is the biggest\nUh is the biggest thing in in in in Arizona right now that's a big issue in the minor league issue yeah\nIt's bigger than immigration and I wanted to hear what Garcia has to say about it but when you pass up an opportunity to talk to thousands and thousands and thousands of people to go to a coffee shop where people are going to smile at you and not ask any questions listen if you can show up on this show
