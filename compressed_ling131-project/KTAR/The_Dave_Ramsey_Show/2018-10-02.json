I'd say my huh\nOh Donald Trump junior come on it's me too movement you should be afraid for your daughter's that's it you should be absolutely afraid of course he's taking the heat for saying this\nThe other problem is that for the people who are real victims of these things when it is so obviously political in case of like this it really diminishes the real claims\nWhich I think is very true but you just read the room every once in a while you got to just read the room that I think I think that's a lost art\nI think that is very much a lost art thing where you could look around and you gotta like okay I can read the room here what are their or something like comics will understand the\nComics will get that they'll read a room and go you know and I can do a little bit of this year I Know a little bit further here you know bans I think we'll we'll get the same thing to get a feeling from the crowd\nAnd and I think sometimes for politicians they're always trying to read the room and they're always trying to be on their best sometimes it just doesn't work out that way and then the ... thing you gotta watch you're going to take a hammer ... look and I worry too I've said it over and over again I'm raising an eight year old son who is my world but quite frankly I Do worry\nAbout him in this day and age of all you know it just takes one accusation takes one of this or you did a little bit of to this and you know in in a day\nAnd age where you you had kids at school right like I get a cold a couple of years ago\nBecause two little girls were chasing him and they tried to kiss him when he was like in first grade and they're like what do you want us to do about this like he wasn't in trouble like I'm like what are you talking about getting a room I don't know\nI mean that's stupid they're being kids but that's the weirdness right you put your finger at a kid when you're when you're if you're a kid all was your finger loaded how dare you\nAnd then you've got to go to sensitivity training and all this stuff like that I mean that's just the insanity of and all that is just the absolute insanity of of this\nI sit back and I sit here and go wow\nBut you do have to read the ... you have to learn how to read the room three two three five three twenty four twenty three at your best and shows your Twitter you can tweet at us still a lot of your or are are are texting and tweeting about Kavanaugh and you know people such as you were in the middle you're independent what do you think about it look I think that both of them\nGave powerful\nPowerful statements ah I Do believe something happened to her do I believe it was him no I think it should let it play itself out I got zero problem with that I Know a lot of people that we should just voted Mitt already doesn't work that way how many times I just plain to people the way it works right the way it works is\nYou need these votes flake\nCollins because if you don't have that we can vote you don't get to take their votes wages vote for the sake of it they may vote no and then he's dead in the water and then what\nWell how do we make them vote while they want this and you're going to get this and\nI don't know if there's going to be in anything that comes out at the end of this I don't think there is I I think in the end is it that that what we have now is kind of what we have which is you're going to have to figure out for yourself and will they get a little bit more time I don't know but\nAlso remember that this isn't one of those things where the FBI is going to come out say uh you know\nThis is not a criminal investigation same way that the proceeding was not a criminal proceeding and that means that they can subpoena witnesses they can't force people to answer their questions they're not necessarily going to draw conclusions\nYeah then ... out there who were just absolutely love was alive he uh he's right so it's not like you're going to we're not going to get anything super Rachel Mitchell who was the woman that was asking questions she put out her little thing and it basically said\nLook there's no\nProsecutor in the world that would carry for a case like this you're going on flimsy\nEvidence at best he said she said she said he said you\nYou you you couldn't draw any kind of real conclusion that this person was guilty of whatever that she was alleging that took place that day and then she that he was the one that perpetrated it so nobody would move forward in a situation like this\nBut that doesn't matter again it's not about Kavanaugh it could have been any but you could look Mickey mouse up there and they would accused him of rape Mickey did you do something that many twenty three years ago I didn't matter it's about just bat or you can\nCome after you Kamala Harris you make you would have been all pissed off to open this you have to watch out bad cry in\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three I bet that Joe is your Twitter Hey Ryan salaam was going to join us next week to talk about immigration and his story and why he doesn't want to open borders Chad messages [noise]\n[noise]\n... adventures show [noise]\n\nHave you ever drink and your car in for an oil change your mechanic find something wrong\nAnd surprise you hit with a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty your paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's why I recommend extended vehicle protection from cars you if your car has five thousand two hundred and fifty thousand miles car shield can save you from paying high\nThey are prepared for it in a way and then you have other folks who are often times great\nDecent hardworking people but they find that they're being incorporated into\nA marginalized minority they're living in segregated communities they feel locked out of the middle class and you might decide as an individual hey I'm the one who moved okay fair enough not a big deal you know I decided to do it myself\nBut then for that person is child it's a very different story when you're raised in that environment where you're assimilating into this kind of underclass group that becomes a really tough and that's what we're ignoring right now we're ignoring the fact that we're not just talking about one single thing called immigration\nWe're talking about different experiences depending on skills language ability and much else\nTalking to ... a melting pot of civil wars new book consent of immigrant makes the case against open borders so we look at like I look at immigration I think we've got to start thinking outside the box I Would love to see us do something kind of European based in the sense of\nIf you're a part of NAFTA or whatever this new thing is maybe there's a lot freer and easy to move in and out of countries where you can come here and we know you're here essentially for lack of better term as a booty call you and make the money and leave\nRather than this fake thing that we're trying to do now which I just don't think is working around I just think we're failing miserably at it and neither side really wants to do anything about immigration and a real way\nI respectfully disagree with you there I see where you're coming from and I do think that there are some ways\nI'm you know to address the system and more sensible ways my concern is having this kind of guest worker migration and freeing up creates other problems down the road because let's say you're here as a temporary guest worker for three years five years what happens\nIs you form routes you form relationships you start a family right and then you say okay now we're going to enforce the rules at this point down the line\nI don't think that's really going to work in a society that value civil liberties Singapore has a guest worker system that works decently well but Singapore is willing to port guest workers who become pregnant\nAnd that's something that I really don't think Americans have the stomach for and that's why I think allowing that kind of temporary immigration you have to be really careful about it you have to be willing to really enforce it on the back end so I see\nYour point and I do think that you know for example you can make it easier for retirees and United States in Mexico you can make it easier for professionals are earning a certain income to make that kind of movement but I think that moving too far in that direction could have downsides\nSee what you're saying it's like everything else that was governor right it's it's the idea maybe good and you might make this amazing you know you come up this incredible idea but the reality is is when we go to put it in ... we never followed through with the way that things are and then it becomes more about feelings in fact and that's where we run into real issues\nI Would go even further than you Chad there are a lot of times when people make an argument for a certain policy without ever intending to follow through\nIn a way it's almost like a fake policy or going to say this is going to be a temporary policy but we're not doing any of the things we need to do in order to actually make it temporary I see that a lot in policy debates and I frankly think it's pretty dishonest and misleading\nRather government isn't the politics right oh you do something wrong to get elected and really nobody cares outside of that 'cause nobody ever hold your you accountable for your actions so let's talk about the ... you're talking about the immigrants we we need in America\nWhich and and there is there is a need for for people not just gets workers you know people are going to pick our fruits and vegetables and whatnot\nBut there's a lot of other skills coding and things like that we're we're falling behind and we need those people here how do we go about doing that in a way that is you know you know I I was a guest worker thing out there but how do we bring people here on merit you know like a meritocracy if you\nIt really is true that you have people who are educated in the United states or who have job offers who could absolutely support themselves and they often find it very very hard to get a green card partly because there are so few green cards available to people on unemployment basis\nSo we give out green cards the vast majority of them to people\nBased on whether or not they're related to someone uh whether or not you're the adult sibling of someone who is already residing in the country and much else\nAnd my own view is that that doesn't make a ton of sense you know maybe you can say okay that that could be a point in your favor but that shouldn't be the only thing we consider we should also take into account\nWhether or not you have the language skills whether or not you have a job offer that pays you well enough to ensure that you're not going to rely on the safety net I think that would make a lot more sense and by the way it would actually be more predictable and\nRational people who find her system totally crazy and maddening would really appreciate that too it would be better for Americans it would be better for people who are trying to see hey what are my guide post\nWhat's being expected of me if I Want to live\nIn the United states what\nWas your was your life like I mean you grow up with New York so what is your life like you you're obviously son of immigrants so they they come here what was their assimilation like what was yours simulation like it in in into the culture of America\nWell in my case I was very lucky partly because I was part of a really small group part of a really small community so when I went to school the vast majority of my friends they came from different backgrounds they came from all over the place and we spoke English to one another and we\nJust grew up in American culture at almost by necessity but then when you have folks were growing up in isolated\nSegregated enclave community is it can be a really different story you find yourself almost trapped in this community and you find yourself alienated and separated from Americans from other backgrounds you know that's an extreme case but it really does happen in some quarters of the country and my fear is that that might\nBe even more the case in the future if we don't adopt more controlled and managed system\nWhen I look at everything at my big fear is and everybody said you know ... over you this that and the other people scream stuff because that's all they know how to do is that\nAmerica we we have a culture in America and for whatever reason the people on the left in particular\nOr afraid of our culture because they only look at the bad of our culture and not that good and I always say that you go around the globe\nPeople love American people to come here and I grew up in a time in an era where\nKids in my school when I was a junior high and escape Cambodia and the ... and they embrace the culture they loved America they believed in the American dream if more than most Americans and yet we can't talk about that in this day and age because the minute you bring something up like that it's a ... trying to kill other people so soldier\nThe American flag makes people uncomfortable\nIt's insane how do we get around that\nIt's really tough because basically right now when people advanced those messages are this idea that the melting pot is I'm terrible thing you get rewarded for it you know these are ideas that you know members of the elite had embraced and that's something that I personally find\nPretty scary because if you don't have a melting pot story if you don't have a unifying story about all that Americans\nDo have in common that's where you get this incredible divisiveness and what your pet one group against another so I agree with you I think that's a big concern and I think that that's why I Want an immigration system that is more sensible rational\nAnd balance because that is what allows immigrants to really become a full part of American culture\nIf if you were to have one thing you can do and immigrants just one thing they come to you and they said around you have one thing that we're gonna we're gonna allow you to put this in here what would that one thing but\nI think we should adopt a points system\nIn which we select immigrants based on their actual qualities what it is they're bringing to the table rather than purely basing it on family ties I think that would be a huge huge improvement over the status quo and I think people would feel a lot better about immigration if they knew that folks\nAre are taking into account uh the contributions people are making and whether the immigration system is actually\nIn the national interest and in the interest of all American workers\nLast question coming on today a and this will will will just quickly go off topic what do you make of the craziness when it comes to the whole Kavanaugh and everything going on right now\nWell I'll just say that Brett Kavanaugh is a guy who\nHas always been in liberal institutions he's had friendships with liberals he was literally hired as a lecturer at Harvard law school by Elena Kagan was appointed the Supreme Court by President Obama he\nSomeone who is always played by the rules are always tried to make friendships and it's really striking to see how much opposition there was to him long before any of these abuse allegations came to light we're\nJust in we're through the looking glass were in this frightening leap partisan environment\nAnd uh and I just don't know where we go from here\nMe either me either melting pot or civil war son of immigrants makes the case against open borders a round salaam hotel and again appreciate your time\nAnd again appreciate your coming on today great book for anybody out there who really wants to understand things thank you so

your phone and it connects to your bank account and the two of you both have access to both of you put it on your phone and put it on your desktop whatever and no matter where you are in the world she can look at the budget you can look at the budget as long as you get Internet access\nAnd they'll show and then you just you can obviously disgusted by phone or email or whatever else you want to do um but you've got to just lay out a game plan that encompasses your expenses there in San Antonio which should be very minimal because I'm guessing you're on base housing right\nYes you're on base food right yet there so you shouldn't have any expenses if your families back home trying to get out of debt you know your shipping all the money home right yet there\nAnd so are most of it I mean but you you just basically going to get a small miscellaneous allowance and then the rest of it's going home for the baby for the kids and for the get out of that plan or whatever you're working back

I mean thousands part of that is from the uh he'll correct that I got screwed over on you don't ... yeah I don't I don't have any credit cards\nAnd you don't have any in the car payments car notes right was that show just\nHow a hundred grand with no debt virtually is cause you to put on ... ... did a budget worded the money go\nI see it as it goes to a you know groceries\nI pay the rent I Do this I Do that but I don't see where it's going then maybe a ... budget baby\n... your take home pay should be what sixty five hundred dollars a month right\nAh yeah well probably close to about or five a month\nNo snow or five months no it's not well I mean\nA hundred thousand dollar is gross out and three hundred a month you do not have four thousand dollars coming out of your check\nOr something ...\n\nArgues others with us in Lexington, Kentucky by other how are you I'm doing good thanks how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo about a year ago I switched positions with a new company and\nI had the opportunity to switch over my four oh one K. about six months after my transition I still have not done that up until this point when I got a statement from um my current investor\nAlter the other day with mine standing um so now I'm at that point um my husband and I am baby step too and I'm not\nSure whether I should have roll over the four oh one K. what she eats about ... broken up into almost a third\nWith ... tax ... tax match um I'm not sure if I should roll it over or cash it out it's just shy of Ninety five hundred dollars and I don't know if I should put that towards baby steps to or just roll it over and\nLeave it until we get in a point of our baby steps to start investing again\n... retirement unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure cause you're going to get hit with your tax rate plus ten percent penalty just probably by third of it would go to the government and that's borrow money or thirty three percent interest playoff detriment idea\nSo rang that so that that's what I Would do is I Would roll led to an IRA and just get with your\nSmart Russia or pro or whoever you use for your investment advice and knew a direct transfer roll over anytime you leave a company I always take my money with me in the form of doing a roll over to an IRA in a way of got control of it\nWhat it's invested in it it's it's convenient for me to get my hands on and if you don't have somebody to help you with that you click smart buster Dave Ramsey dot com you fill in your stuff it'll drop down and listen to people in your area\nThat we recommend called smart buster pros and they'll help you out and he's with us in Columbus, Georgia Hi Anthony how are you\nHow good how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay um I Am contemplating going to a new job and my current I'm a nurse and that's his and um my current hospital\nOffer to ensure held a life insurance policy\nThat I think it's about five hundred thousand um my new employer their life insurance policy they offer is only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have some ... orders and I just I get denied or I'd have an outrageously expensive\nPolicy and I just I'm trying to think outside the box that I'm not stuck in a job that I'm unhappy because of this one issue you know I don't know how\nYou're going to be making more at the other position\nIt'll be the same okay I'm going to be\nBetter I only have to drive ten minute instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they could add some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nAsked about that and they said the man I spoke with said that it's a bundle package and he doesn't believe that's the case mhm\nRight and I spoke with um our investor and he um he said he goes to the airport for a while and he spoke about managed bond account and a\n... [laughter] I never heard of it I I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um\nI mean you you need to build up a big pile of money called Wilson the need to worry about life insurance so that's the general principle that you moved towards a or about\nTo pay our house off in December I don't have any that um\nAnd so you know math and the more well if you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm\nRight if you're ever enough wealth that your family is fine and you have no bad and your family's fine without your income than we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured\nYour family's morning 'cause the point is is the family major income to live right on to the extent they don't need that\nTo the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shop or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried\nCalling ... calls aunt or insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nWell I got another diagnosis back in March that when I looked up life insurance and this diagnosis that um\nThey basically said you'd get denied but I haven't tried Vander\nYeah try them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and find out that I don't I think you may be right I mean you you know you probably found some bowed research and probably not in Europe all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't have different degrees that in mind mild but I um when they hit record it kind of\n... about the actual fact you die in our family is left without you what's the probability of that\nLand on that it probably are going on and on and get help so I mean it could get worse but he made I mean that's how old are you studying in okay\nSo I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old would have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve and it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not gonna worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income which you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds in your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think your husband can struggled through\nYeah I think\nYou know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy and about three hundred thousand in retirement you and your house just ... ... and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he going to be OK yeah you'll be OK\nYeah plus I'm guessing he works right hey right yeah yeah so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job\nBecause the calls and their for informational purposes and just double check your assumptions OK okay thank you thank you Michael's with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up uh\nSo overall I'm trying to figure out whether or not to continue to build up my underfunded emergency strong or to pay off my car so I can give you a little bit of a back story\nWe teach people who we call the baby steps\n... baby after one is a thousand dollars All right I got\nThat anything above that goes on baby step to any other money goes on that anything except your home you lose your debt smallest largest you attack that with a vengeance how much do you own your car\nOr Eighteen thousand on a car and I do have a mortgage also\nAnd how about what's your household income\n[noise] sixty four fifty five thousand so how fast you can pay off in Eighteen thousand dollar car pretty quick what's printing quick uh well right now I'm just making the normal ended up so\nFast to make like sixty thousand are you going to pay Eighteen thousand do that math\nNine months yeah\nYou have no life you get the car paid off or you sell the car move down one of the two which you don't need to pay that much longer how old are you twenty four\nTwenty four and a [laughter]\nAlmost like I've done this before [laughter] okay yeah so you got to really expensive car and it's kicking you in the teeth so a payoff half the car right good oh my God it's a really expensive car what is it worse\nA paid thirty and you make ... it was it was my graduation present myself yeah I'm also a resident to yourself not a president turning my brother and myself\nAs I'm going to run my life you know now that hasn't okay they must get stupid thing paid off or let's get it let's get a show on the today show you got about nine months to pay it off with a thousand dollars you got any money saved other than a thousand dollars\nA curly with the company match I'm putting fifteenth out\nStop putting money in your four O. one K. and to get this carpet off\nOkay and I'm putting three hundred dollars a month into an emergency fund\nStop doing that see how much are emergency funds are approaching four thousand dollars\nCorrect okay take three of it out but it only Eighteen you're down to one shop all savings\nAnd completely lenient completely focused and completely affected by this car\nIf you are unwilling to do those things that means you need to sell this car [noise]\nIf you're a business owner I Need you to listen up did you know that more than half of teens today associate stress and worry with money half and young adults are entering\nAnd young adults are entering the workforce with no idea how money works that's not

while I can think of a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter]\nThat is awesome guys well since you are experts in indoctrinated through and through what do you tell people\nWhen they ask how you get out of that you've been all of a hundred and fifty three thousand twenty three months no matter where you met that's not easy\nIt's not I I think that they get fired with having a back and having a plan together and they think of that plant every Nazi\nAnd I'd\nSay for for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the Wyoming really blessed and the fact that um\nWhile before we met and I can look back at my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it you know\nYou got all that on the way while you were single yeah absolutely [laughter]\nGood for you guys very very well done I Love it that is awesome it you're right that's a great story that's a great story gives me a whole new idea for a new product line\nAnd you go up there I think to one of the\nOne the biggest thanks for for us is that um we found out about eight months ago that we are going to be having our first child\nNow [noise] so uh we we had about two months to go getting out of debt and we just hammer down to finish this often I Know\nMy personal story my father passed away at a uh he was thirty six years old well our family and a pretty tight spot my mom a as such a hard worker erode the family\nUm but I had many health problems which make money tough yeah so I get overwhelmed to think that our child will not ever know about that yeah well not ever know how that life is you know you know\nI'm sure you're I'm sure you euro seemed about term life insurance through with that now\nAs we were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me is that when the Holy Spirit and not just you to do something and you don't have any debt you know what you do you do it\nTo the moon though I was talking about that the other day it's tough to serve two masters\nThat's right and uh when you don't have another master in your life you only have one it's a lot easier

I Can't I Can't vote for this guy he got into a fight with a lead singer of you know he didn't shouldn't be just I don't care\nOnly be disqualified just for hanging out with Krista ugly let me read so let me let me rephrase that he'd be disqualified for going to be forty concert I mean I don't think you should be a Supreme Court justice if you go to a ...\nIs the Supreme Court about taste or about ... the judicial system\nAllegedly it was a it was a major Ginsburg likes the opera I hold that against allegedly was Chris Dudley who threw the beer at the victim\nBut he but he threw a brick he totally missed totally man it was having all that stuff that connected All right so you ask a really interesting question does this matter the only way this matters if it is if I'm having a lot about it\nYou know doesn't matter that even lives that well that's what I don't understand well I mean if you if you lie to the Senate Judiciary committee\nYou can't why you're not supposed to ... you're saying lying about anything or just lying about whether or not or get or to the fight or really want to say hey you are the lead singer you'll be forty great question I mean the incidents\nYou know to me does not ... it doesn't rise to the level of you can't be Supreme Court justice I'm Sorry right that Ronald soap does yeah but not this crap yeah his drinking habits\nI I'm sure we're out of hand but you know this is a guy who kind of portrayed himself as a choir while you were born he's definitely not\nUm so so I Would just say if\nYou know he was he was answering questions about being a heavy drinker and did you ever blackout and did you ever get sick from from drinking too much and he basically was just saying no no no I mean he's probably going to get caught on that you know that's a flat out why and I mean I I'm just telling you in college come on we all did it\nWe all throw up from a beer maybe\nWe we all drank too much I never got into a bar fight I never got out of hand after drinking\nYeah back when when Senator Jeff Flake says I'm going to vote no if he lied what does he have to lie about well but if you can't remember you can't remember it Jeff Flake to me is trying to get catch them in a gotcha no matter what he says or does well that's a lie I Can't\nWell that's a lie I Can't vote for him it's just too easy\nYou know if you lied about Dr Ford wild that you and your own proven he's gone there's no doubt about it\nDid he get in a bar fight should we care probably not did he have a drinking problem I don't know I still think he drinks a lot I mean I might I might still have a drinking problem you'll ever heard anybody talk more about beer during\nA frame quite joining with my friends almost everyone did I still like beer I liked fear I like beer I still like beer I still like beer and I'm Still enjoy beer beer I like beer and I still drink beer\nYeah that attitude I don't think did him any failure by the well no but I mean this incident at Yale makes them look like you know drunk and fool\nYou know if it happened what makes it look like a frat boy and when I think the Supreme Court justice is I Do not think of frat boys while I said yesterday but I don't think it should preclude him ah I don't know what happened in that room with Dr Ford I don't know about these other accusers I I don't know what I Do know\nIs that Brett
