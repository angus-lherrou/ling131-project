they're talking about how much Brett Kavanaugh drank some how much did he drank and you know that some letter came out that they they read right before they asked me a question from that you know the national association of law professors saying you know\nThat the Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be confirmed I said look\nYou know I'm really tired of this I'm I'm really tired first of all\nWe're all sitting here talking every night for three weeks about what's another ... says and I'm I'm tired about talk you know talking about yeah lays who couldn't get into a State University you know and and

the shark chat this completely jumped the shark\nAnd it's really important for your listeners to know that if they don't get out\nAnd vote for the Republican incumbent house members this is absolutely a dress rehearsal for impeachment and if the if the house goes below the president will be impeached for Jay walking in the first quarter of twenty Nineteen\nMy God that'd be interesting to watch the

Alister back is apologizing first thing the other day in the Pennsylvania governor's debate I don't even know why anybody would bring them in to do that but it would be very interesting to see\nVery interesting to see the way this thing works I think that this though so cabinet I'm saying is really set it up and has energized the the Republicans are and ... will they get out there you know every between now and November you know there's more than anybody Michael that is for ever and politics and God Knows by Tuesday\nTrouble of said something something will happen and Kavanaugh will be in the

starts\nNext week right if you're doing TV commercials if you haven't defined yourself and to find your opponent by now you're already out of the race but you're commercials to get out the vote and

by then they'll run out of the paid a but the money they get paid by George Soros you know maybe mommy's calls them back to clean their basement rooms out\nAnd uh and so it will dissipate by Wednesday Thursday then we only got twenty five days twenty three days\nThat still a lifetime but then the mail comes and the TV comes and the radio comes and the phone banks come\nWe might not be picking too

ground into non existence\nYeah yeah well he's going to happen I mean you know there's no way that that her office didn't leak this information and and I got nothing is Dr Blasey Ford I think something happened to his traumatic\nWhether or not it was him we'll never know because you and I and nobody else were in that room or whatever it took place at night\nBut the whole process of how her name got out there and how this I feel bad for because I feel like the Democrats threw out there and I don't think she was prepared for it and and it became a you know they're just like you by any means necessary and to me I find that to be really just an awful thing to do\nYeah I I've been thinking that way too I I Believe something probably happen to to ah Christine Ford I\nBut I got to tell you you look at when she took her\nHer uh her a polygraph right you understand but at the time she was visiting her friend who was an FBI agent right an FBI agent who she helped to coax according to her boyfriend who wrote a into the uh United States Senate under\nA penalty of perjury ... she ... she she trained as a psychologist\nTo try to beat a polygraph when she joined the FBI these things were happening remember\nBrett Kavanaugh was being interviewed or in in in private member classified sects session\nBy Democrats by ... by a Dianne Feinstein about personal accusations on the same time at the same time practically the same moment that Dianne Feinstein staffers were introducing Christine forward to lawyers that are activists and the Democratic party so\nYeah I Believe but she was outed by Dianne Feinstein I Believe a staffer and Dianne Feinstein office probably a a a leak that a letter\nOf but she really a completely a clean hands and how this came out and when it came out I don't know and they don't know if things we hear that Chris Christie and Ford wasn't interviewed and a judge Kavanaugh wasn't interviewed by the FBI\nI gotta tell ya I think if I'm Christine forward

favorite books on\nWorking with people changing behaviors is called boundaries by Dr Henry Cloud\nI read it many many years ago and since then Henry and I had become really good friends I Love Henry\nI loved that book too\nAnd one of the things I grass from reading that book and other books\nIs this there is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nThose of us that are wise in emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free from the bondage of the fence\nYou're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victim eyes are free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nYoung lady called a minute ago and was trying to figure out\nHow to should she reconnect with a brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting her brother in law after he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years\n\nHis wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but\nNot the sister in law she didn't want to be around it so here's the question at what point for someone's misdeeds\nDo you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine can't imagine going to say something like that\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars\nIs to not set yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do for give them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever\nTo someone who ... meaning you wouldn't go on a date with him you know someone steals your wallet you can forgive them but you're not gonna\nYou know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money\nYou wouldn't be reconciled with them probably ever in that situation\nBut in the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong her\n\nYou know the guy's wife who was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong and\nHer brother in law how how it worked out his brother in law but anyway it was I think I guess her husband's family as a way I understood it but anyway the the lady that do the wife is who was wrong to she forgave animals reconciled to the husband as he supposedly just putting his life by getting out of my life\nBack together I don't know the guy you don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it you know\nAny one of you listening is capable of adult Herschel fares\n\nEveryone's capable of\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and ring my hands and be mad at him and worried about him\nI Hope we turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again on his wife I'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that's what reconciliation is or what am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround Israel\nShould we run into this all the time with her coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to crush them again after that\n\nMap you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously\nGonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled to you financially\nI'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is a pet is I you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families finance us it's on be leave all so he comes and he's discovered she's discovered he's a abetting\nAddict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing his pastor and he's seeing a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that may not have control of and not have any access to money\nFor a while\nUntil trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you you have not bat on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again\nYou trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're not gonna treat you like you have no\nAbility to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from you too you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust his rebuilt and overtime is rebuilt\nIf you cannot when someone has\n... on something like we're talking about here has ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not\nEntering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you and two years clean if the guy's clean\nFrom his double life adult for survivors or whatever he was doing on addiction whatever it was something like it was all of that\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real if they're still looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this guy straight\nAnd if he's straight for two years than you know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already which she might just be an enabler she might be\nShe might be ... and that could be what's going on [noise]\nCould be that he's cleaned up is alive and you're just suffered you can't forgive\nSay that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at different times\nGenerally forgiveness should come faster than reconciliation\nAbout pet a dog and it provides may forgive the dog\nThis is the day Ramsey [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance

eight to five\nFive two to five [noise]\nBrad starts off the hour in Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] I think for taking my call there sure how can I Know\nI have a question are we uh my wife and I are just getting started and baby step\nTo ah we've got about Ninety thousand in and we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have come your car that I use regularly on most\nDays of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to call a trailer her car she owes about eleven thousand on and if you're a ... percent interest we could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we've been in the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it ... ...\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay all the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worth\n[noise] um I ... truck is probably worth about Fifteen my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell it for about ...\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though so we're good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but that that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free and to you\nFive to ... to a new job and we'll talk about your life and your\nMoney Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college money from my one year old mhm I'm I'm I'm Thirty years old\nI'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash ... um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought\nIt I put Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have some you know equity\nAnd um and I have about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old\nCollege fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him and and kinda picking out some grow stock mutual fund\nTo see what goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my what do I deal with this kind of pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep\nMy living expenses for for um you know every any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shake shack draw towards my how he owned a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um and that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now or what do you make\n'em so uh about Seventy eight year\nThere's the household income yeah yeah okay All right\nAnd uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I have a pension um that I put a about a hundred\nAnd thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory okay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay\nAnd that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of a hundred for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in robocalls at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nWhat I Would just go to smart bastard die Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the ... best in business I don't care what you do okay in fact my income at all\nBut people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nYet married um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a\nFifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand and that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds I spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and gross a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now\nOnce you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine okay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart Mr pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that\nMakes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different the ... in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six\nWhen the house is paid off that leads you to the last baby step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money on finding my budget them all the ski jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nHi Dave I'm great how are you guys are better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand ain't got a hundred and Ninety three thousand is pretty abnormal it currently with the U.S department of treasury on it as a result of having been a dishonorable service academy at three years ago\nAnd that the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact it will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount for um\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWhile I learned you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to untie thirty thousand bucks this thing or if it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're going to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I have never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask the surf through and lip service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death\nOn and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and they were given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge have to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something wow well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nDave Ramsey here for years I've been telling everybody that window world is simply the best for less apparently others think so too JD power recently ranked window world highest in customer satisfaction with windows\nFaction with windows and patio door retailers\nSo what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and hand it plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know of of her checking am because\nHeart when I got a boyfriend got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah what do we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of initially\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that it was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on a healthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got to counseling and so for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but I Do see if she doesn't she's going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nOur now she only did he medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want them just you know you know all the rest of their life\nIs I mean they had control there she has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as a semi mentally ill and she is with she's not on a couple of different minutes she does\nHer ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen yeah and it happens to people all the time though what did she say right now when they call her on the show you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them 'cause you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't think\nI should be talking she should be telling\nThem either one of your among a long conversation it's I got nothing you

last week Jeff Flake was trying to tell us that he was struggling with his decision which by the way I thought was the U.S from day one\nIt seems that Jeff Flake is going to vote for Brett Kavanaugh and he will be in the column of yes vote so you go to Arizona centers and to yeses for Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court justice nominate yeah from what we understand today is the vote with fifty one forty\nNine basically you had a very small margin of error I mean you know\nOne or two votes could have swung it either way\nRight but Jeff Flake said if I don't get an FBI investigation to clear my conscience I guess I Would vote no he got the investigation even though it was short some say was hamstrung some say wasn't good enough\nBut he got it so he voted yes now there shouldn't be any surprises and Kavanaugh probably be nominated tomorrow Senator Jon Kyl\nHaving been with him in interviews with majority of my colleagues\nAnd otherwise gotten to know him\nAnd having witnessed and learn to the U.S team which he was held by calling by former law clerk some students professional friends and being aware of his contributions to this community whose country\nHe's decided ghetto\nYeah remember Karl was the one who showed him around before he took McCain's seat\nOr do the surges in the polls yeah according to a a light pole the latest poll I should say Arizona gubernatorial a governor Doug juicy has a Fifteen point six lead over or David Garcia his Democratic opponent and when you dive into the party do the whole the party crossover advantage\nSixteen points three percent of\nDemocrats support Garcia says he's only four point seven Republicans support and do see also has the upper hand with independents who favor him by seven points so he's doing really well\nI mean you hold the Republicans would you expect you to do\nGood there's ... there's a box jak okay now how about the independent vote or I Do see he's up by seven that's another box checked that means you win the election I mean that's really it holds your party or do well with independents released being positive territory you win the election was a doozy hasn't done enough to lose this election\nThat's what this has all come about and and Garcia really hasn't done anything to win the election this was always in my opinion do seas election to lose you know I think if he didn't figure out a way to pay teachers\nAre we see a completely different election right now yeah I really do I mean that's that's pretty obvious but next week\nWe're going to talk to both candidates live in Studio I think to see is on Monday\nWhen is Garcia she Wednesday\nI Believe when you say well double check that out but you know guards Garcia is down by what sixteen now in this limbo\nFree the number three story on the all Arizona daily download and the worst city in Arizona\nTucson Tucson and there's no surprise there the typical household in Tucson earns just forty thousand dollars a year less than three quarters of the median income of fifty three route fifty three thousand across the state has a whole\nA low income you've got the impact evidence in the high share of area residents living in poverty and it's a violent town as well looks like Sasha Baron Cohen did not I guess did not do enough damage for came in to earn this distinction\nThey are in this distinction it's still Tucson yeah bottom line on Tucson porous city in Arizona\nMost dangerous city in Arizona yeah uh I don't know if you want to go into a correlation between you know low income people and then\nBut but then Jeff Flake always vote for Donald Trump so he goes back on party lines yeah Donald Trump's lines and then you scratch your head and say well why did you even come out and say something in the first place because he's a big phony yeah he's a big phony I think that Jeff Flake last week tried to pull you know what do you call it pulled the uh\nOver what pull the wool over your eyes all over your eyes Mac that's what I was trying to say [laughter] but what was the point of that he's out his point of I needed investigation\nWas I got to look good to both parties because I'm running for president I don't think Jeff Flake rap about Arizona anymore I really believe that I don't think he cares well\nHe hasn't talked to anybody in Arizona for a while now here a long time he's gone on the today show is going to a national showed up and he hasn't been on\nArizona's tough new New Hampshire is his best friend he's already been there twice this year so I think Jeff Flake is looking out for himself I don't think he was looking out ah for let's see the women who stopped him last week in the elevator and said how could you do their life and he looked you know he looked so hurt and I think\nI Want to say this is ... and I said this last week and I and I truly believe this\nWhen you saw Jeff Flake in that elevator and the women who were sexually assaulted stopped him confronted him while he blocked him from the same damn yelled at him right I I Believe that last week\nIf that wasn't caught on camera\nBecause it was and it went viral if it wasn't caught on camera Jeff Flake never would have asked for an investigation\nI think he knew that that went viral I think he he saw himself on television I think he saw the women\nYou know uh who who basically how could you do this is Senator Flake how could you do this and Senator Flake had that long face looked like someone shot his dog\nAnd it never bought it I think that was never caught on video or tape Jeff Flake would never have asked for an investigation last week and I think the reason he asked for investigation most likely was that video\nWas that situation that happened in the elevator and it wasn't that he was hurt by it or that he was he couldn't sleep for three days because of that or\nI never bought that Jeff Flake was going to vote yes no matter what but he has to look good to at least maybe independence or Democrats paving the way for him to run for president right he's a big phony that guy is a phony\nOr we told you what he was going to do\nHe did exactly what we said he was going to do and and nothing's really change that's what Jeff Flake does that does US Senate floor and he gives this great speech and he says work together and you're like wow this guy really has something and then he does what he does\nSo I don't buy shoes which is vote on party lines he he falls in line with other Republicans I Do a ... the ... when you mentioned that the he was confronted in the elevator now people are starting to say I'm going to start a group to follow Jeff Flake around to every restaurant cafe store et cetera where he goes for the rest\nOf his life and yell at him well that's all if you weren't going to go down the road of I'm not sure I Want an FBI investigation boy you really screwed the pooch you screwed yourself with a lot of people by just going along and saying yeah nothing to see here yes uh-huh\nI mean I don't want to wear all around like this I mean that's unfair no no but you set yourself up for that by by saying or up hearing that you are sensitive to Dr Christine forwards testimony you really were struggling\nI thought he would vote no if he found other people now he didn't do any of that he voted yes so he could advise will he he's open himself up to being followed mocked taunted whatever you want to call it he could've voted with Murkowski though she voted no not enough people I Know that not enough people are I think if there were more people that were going to vote no or more Republicans\nI think he would have been part of a gaggle but you know he's just\nYou know I I don't know what the future is for him but he ... I don't care if he's not a ... well my point is if he's going to run for president you got to figure out who you are an ... you got to figure out John McCain stood up and said no and this is not right and not only talk to talk but walk the walk Jeff Flake talks the talk\nAnd then he doesn't walk the walk right so I don't know I don't know really what his mindset is really what he wants to do but he is now open himself up to a number of people especially women who are now saying that they're going to follow him around\nYou know I said all the time I don't love Trump\nI don't hate Trump some of his policies are very goes beyond this is bigger than Donald Trump now yeah my my my point is at least with Donald Trump you know where he stands and sometimes it just it you know when he mocked Christine forward earlier this week how awful was that yeah but at least the guy is real he knows you know where he stands for\nKnows you know where he spent and unfortunately you don't change his mind no and it yeah it half the time I hate where he stands on the other half is it's not that bad but at least like when John ... bad but with Jeff Flake you don't know where this guy stance he says he stands here and then the next day he's over here is a total phoney baloney\nThey sound like my cousin\nThat's the term he used when he was like six phoney baloney I Know but it it makes me feel like a six year old and that makes me feel happy you know as we back to my childhood speaking of childhood I ran around the office yesterday yelling\nI'm the best that ever I did see you do that I was
