I mean you know uh you've been through stuff a lot of people have been through stuff and and I've always said look\nSome people in life throws were horrific things and water off the ducks back and some people go through stuff that seems to reveal a minor or or or it's a big deal but it stays with them forever and I think this is if you're talking to people out there who have gone through stuff\n... what's the advice you can give them because I think you know judging by what I've read and and talking to you All right well where I think a lot of people other people haven't\nYet you know it is hard and I think a lot of um a lot of change can come out just conversations I Know a lot of the messages I've gotten so far from other survivors are just people who message me to argue it it's like you just have to remind them to look at things objectively\nYou know I'm so sorry for what happened to you and you didn't deserve it but that doesn't mean that Kavanaugh is your attacker or as equal to your attacker like you have to look at each\nYou know as a case by case basis that it does matter and you know when you're accusing someone have something that you know maybe you might have a ... you might have a right to be believed it you know in a room with your therapist or among your circle of family and friends but you don't have a right to be believed in a court of law or\nWhen you're making this public accusation the way that Dr Ford that you don't have the right to just be blindly believe you have to have some proof and I know that might sound harsh but it's just that's reality that's just realistic\nYou know one of the thing that evidence that protects us\nIs something I talked about which is I think a lot of women out there who didn't say something looked at Kavanaugh and said\nEssentially they they they they superimpose them in their life as he's the attacker and this is my way of getting even at the person who did something to me and he's the one that we're going to make as the giant rapist of of all these people who didn't have a chance to get back of their attacker\nRight absolutely I I really do think there is a lot of that going on he was just he was just kind of that the man's who to blame you know through that because maybe they ... they didn't come forward and their attacker got away you know innocent and got away free so let's make this man pay for it for what this woman says he did to her absolutely I think there's a lot of that\nThey're very very interesting a great article I appreciate your coming on today it's called ... and I don't want you to just take my word words a Kelsey curtain I just think he's still very much into an md we'll talk again about something more pleasant in the future\nThanks so much for having me\nThank you actually I've been to chose your Twitter ca JD being as though in a very interesting and like I've said in one of the things that I continue to say and talked\nAbout is I think a lot of people looked at Kavanaugh as I couldn't get my attacker I couldn't get the person and now is the chance for us to essentially get\nHim and\nThat's what they did they did for some people politically it was just stopping them but for a lot of people out there it was a personal thing and he was the one that their anger was that even though it was other to them they didn't get them Kavanaugh was the

program now since the last November\nAnd uh gotten rid of a lot of good my mother she babysit their kids or our kid right now will be two here in November ... um and she's planning on moving back so\nRight now we live with my mother in law which is my wife's mom and if my mom leave my wife has to quit her job to take care of the kids because the cost of childcare here is exponentially Hi [noise] um\nAnd we have an option to move down there with them\nI'm I'm thinking we should but\nBecause of Baltimore jobs are transferable mhm we could transfer their Phil ... both of our jobs if she quits also we our health insurance goes to my health insurance which is a lot more expensive than hers mhm and so what does your wife make er about thirty two thousand a year\nAnd I make around forty okay\nYou know she's not going to ... for daycare on that you want to lose money she basically be working for daycare and health insurance but mainly\nUm I mean it's not going to end it's not twenty five hundred dollars a month but it is probably going to be a you know Fifteen hundred isn't it yeah come up to Eighteen 'cause one will be born you know going out to babies okay yeah I'm All right and what do you do for a living\nI'm In sales or my wife works for the state what are you so [noise] um pest control and termites stuff like that\nMhm and that your company as a branch and the other city\nOh yeah ... throughout the state okay All right\nUm well here's one issue age which is leaving and I think I Would want to decide where idle Leo's\nBased on some formula other than where the babysitter live ...\nYes [laughter]\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're here open phones a AAA eight to five five at two to five Diane is on Facebook what is a home equity line of credit is it worth having or should I avoid it\nWell a line of credit is an approved\nAlone that you take out only when you would want to\nWhere you can get pre approved and have a lien against your house for a certain amount of money and that's a line of credit home equity line of credit means you're pledged your house for that line of credit\nUm and this is a method of getting a second mortgage on your home basically\nA show a is it worth having or should I avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we try to take the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one would you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have\nMoney the bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of thumb when buying a used car\nUm\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the car worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well bill I mean ... again Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that\nAh it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we can depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last year's car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or no I got to got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day\nAnd um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I just really don't know how can I just looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nTaking my call Sherman what's up I'm Seventeen or go on a high cook a near I've got about three thousand dollars and then the cat out donating should I in bed and I knew what China and you're going to college\nThe community college with a pilot program in St Louis and olive tree okay so you're only going to do two years and then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the maturity and I keep them at the community colleges is either and you write out in the workforce yeah you know\nI Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that crime\nSo that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever\nMhm\nOkay uh and the community college is paid for\nAs long as you keep an eye plus um you can invest it\nAh here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine finished college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump\nSo if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you dust and has a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds a you know made I talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account to stage\nA with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree and your field of study\nWhether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools and your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to deliver your dream without any that\nAnd that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than broaden the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out\nAnd use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise] if you need to\nThanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago I Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward type of cooking for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our growth take home pay our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration\nSo when we saved the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage toleration so is it okay to do that or him recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in are you ... are you vested in that is that uh uh you're choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGet the answer no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYup okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like\nThe pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its a horribly runs state and now we're battling on those guys [laughter]\nOh yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we Canada's or for then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit our show and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nThat that's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit\nAppreciate your joining us this is that Iran she shows [noise]\nBy all means or veal Phoenix, Arizona there's an RV farm stadium huge selection of new ways used motor home safely you'll have trouble\nAre waving and you start telling 'em right what do you tell them\nWell there's a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team that can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team and as long as two of you can come together and really get on board it can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know one of the main\nThings that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just flies through the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much\nWell let's just generally troop generally true have soil I also think that um they need to focus on why they're doing it so to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason it hits why but the end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ...\n... ... what was your why\nRight here I I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I I'm listening to a lot of your stuff and a lot of other um hot cast on legacy and love are leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start teaching it Mm\nModeling it in teaching it yeah I Am change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves\nAnd it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday you know what you if you live like no one else later you can live and give like no one else but in the process of doing that you do change the trajectory of your family tree\nSo very well done good you guys very cool very cool or do you have a lot of cheerleaders along the why are some people that kind of went and I think you'd be more nuts\nYou know we have ah we had some and we had some of the flip side right I'm you're going to have something to try to play down but you know I think the one thing we had some good mentors

Sox\nLet's see how it's going for the chief genealogist of the New England is George any logical society and American ancestors dot org\nWell it's going really well in in town for anybody who's a member of Red Sox nation I'll tell you that that was quite a beating the Yankees got in on fire boys I mean\nYeah yeah yeah I don't want to hear about that All right let's I'll come on you ever met a man with what they said well\nIt's New York you know what can I tell you about that by the way congratulations to my friend David he's got a book out that's been around forever it's called a guide to Massachusetts cemeteries and it just released its third edition and I know that helps out a lot of people you started that when you were really young didn't ya\nRight outta school started as a rolodex so yeah the third edition just went to the burner last week so it took about a month we'll have it here in American ancestors but I'm really proud of and it's got from a roll of extra being over three hundred pages long now\nFor every ... every town fossil nicely done All right let's get doing with our family he's to our news today where do we want to begin David\nWork in the beginning Sweden was really cute story eight year old the young lady who went out into the middle of the lake on which was a stick put it often she was holding a Fifteen hundred year old sort\nOf amazing they're calling her the queen of sweet lady lonely\nI mean I don't think there's any more important but on the ancestry side then that shared match button right\nI agree yeah absolutely that's the key things that I use all the time in my work trying to find people's families and understanding of shared matches is of paramount importance\nIt's really complicated sometimes though when you start going from okay well I I've got a match to this one I shall not recognized you go to the matches matches and sometimes you can start to break it open that way if you had that experience\nI have that something that you need to be a little bit careful with you don't want to take too many hops and assume that the person is still related to the first person that you started with especially if you've got colonial us ancestry\nWith a lot imagine that the right thing but I\nDo that all the time with my own matches if I find somebody that I don't recognize\nIt will mark and they don't feel that matches known you know Smith Jones defendant or you know whatever line they are and then I'll look at the shared matches with that person and I will say matched matches or something I typically don't go any farther than that at my own research but eventually that information can be really helpful because\nYou know especially when you're working with more distant matches not everybody's going to match everybody else but that doesn't mean they're not related if that makes sense\nThat makes a lot of sense you know there there are a lot of little tools on ancestry I think are under utilized but I think are really helpful and you just mentioned one of the little note area we're matches and people are worried maybe the some of these people will see that would of course you can see bad it's just for your own personal notes on your own account\nRight and you could mark all kinds of stuff there which means you don't have to click into that to see how they're related just click on the ... you'll see the whole thing you can put in there how many center Morgan's you share who you think this person might be related through what the common ancestry might be what the relationship is often put in you know three seats\nTo our for third cousin twice removed or something like that and by keeping track of that it just makes it a whole lot easier than going through now now where did we find that person again\nBecause you think you're going to remember all of these things you know it goes by like that I like it this far so yeah and um\nThat record keeping step is fairly important with my own match it if I Know the relationship with her cousin or whatever I'll put that in my put the number of Senate organs that we share it so I don't have to look that up again common ancestors and I know it and then I Will put in my matches entire ancestral line from the common ancestor to themselves and those are nice things to not have to keep\nSnow back up again and again in the right to absolutely\nOne thing I just wanted to add on you talked about not having to click into the match and being able to look at the notes\nFrom the main page and there is a extension for the chrome browser called met better DNA that makes it even easier that you don't even have to click on the little notes icon it you can can figure that his display all your notes on the age when you look at me and match paid sweet\nYeah it's awesome and then that makes it a little easier to do some searching and I like to do that especially with my first paycheck matches I'm always\nKind of looking at that his new what's different who don't I Know who they are those are the ones that really kind of get under my skin and if it's somebody that's in my first fifty matches that I don't know who they are when I can see all the notes than I can see who I don't know and those are the ones that I kind of tend to focus on a little more\nI'm Talking to rush in Jordan since she's a DNA specialist with legacy tree genealogy isn't a grudge and how far back do typically like to research your mattress\nWell it kind of depends on how closely related they are to me or to the person\nThat I'm researching so you know if they share sixty Seventy Santa Marta and they're probably a third cousin is how I Want to go back at least have a great great grandparents and\nSometimes you can go now to so far and then the connection becomes clear that off and you have to go at least that far or maybe even a generation back I don't research everybody that I encountered at fourth or fifth grandparents because there aren't enough\nHours in the name of that [laughter] yeah right but\nIt's a fine line between not spending too much time on everybody but going far enough so that you're not missing something beyond a key person\nKnow I'm just thinking you know when you go to break open brick walls which I think is really the primary purpose of finding these matches other than confirming maybe what you think you already know when you get back to the AIDS boy it really gets complicated in so many of them to try to sort through in mom's side dad's side\nLine and sometimes they're tied to multiple lines because you're from the same area because\nBut if you can find them to the fourth cousins in at least break open your brick walls to the third great grandparents level that's that's pretty exciting stuff right\nIt is and yeah I I think I miss him terribly your previous question but yeah the fifth have cousins I look at some of them I don't look at most of them and I hear people comment on their total number of matches including all the distance matches you know all I have twenty thousand\nMethods I Can't look at the mall well of course you're not going to and that shouldn't be a goal no hum I Will focus on\nSome that are in the ... to eighth if they come up on a surname search and then I'll explore that a little more and you know hopefully they might have some shared matches with some other people who are in my first cousin a closer list and then that kind of get my attention and right\nAnd it's important for people to know by the way if you're trying to match people who were first through fourth cousins they will show you the matches you have in the ... states cousins right you go to the east coast and click on matches it will show you any closer relatives you have\nTo force cousins that's true and that is a point of frustration for many ancestry there's although I have to say now three years into this I really have come to see the wisdom of that decision on ancestry is part\nI think Fifteen cent mark and cut off would be nice as an ad on but the processing power involved with that I don't think it's going to happen but I think it's better not to have your shared matches list muddied with you know seven and eight Senate Morgan matches I think that ultimately creates more confusion than clarity\nYeah that's true it makes it difficult though when you're really trying to work on something a little bit further back yes we will be nice to have the option although I'm thinking if the options there then it's basically going to be all in or not [laughter] right\nRight right yeah in a former lifetime I wrote software for a living and so I've thought a lot about the implications of that sort of thing\nSo I Would say whatever I don't know what kind of improvements would you like to see on ancestry\nI'm adding more colors to their stars\nYes with the huge and that and ours\nRight that to me is surprising that it hasn't been implemented yet because it seems like it wouldn't be that difficult to change it I think it would be\nA real crowd pleaser for their customers so that's one and I'd really like to see more search capabilities you know we've got the surname search and you can search location but you can't do both\nYou can't do both and the ability to put in a first name you know when you're searching other people's trees especially if you had a really common surname that you're looking at one of my husband's ancestor lines as bait\nAnd Mike in search ... from Virginia but it's just overwhelming and sure most of them actually end up matching some of their line completely when I look at the shared matches and if I could put in that first name and date of birth and that sort of thing that would be incredibly helpful\nWell some

the heart of your weekend here on Arizona's new station Katie a our news here\nWith Damon and Matt time Jennifer Perry\nIs online today if you have any questions for the guys that we'd love to get your email questions they'll actually answer them for you too and we're going to cover some of those questions coming up on today's show but he liked to drop us an email again that website is winning with money radio dot com\nThat's winning with money radio dot com or of course our team members will take your calls off the air today at for eight zero six to zero sixty nine o seven\nThat's for eight zero six to zero sixty nine seven and I know our listeners appreciate that you take your questions you address real retirement issues with them each and every week here on the show but\nI'll take your way back first this weekend here\nOn the White House lack for ... for that those are the glory days earlier bath [laughter]\nBut I mean when you were say you know five to Fifteen we're gonna give you a big range here but what did you want to be when you grew up Matt I'll start with you\nA fire to Fifteen range to a one point I wanted to be the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys how that turned out and I went on a diet I did not allow and then I realized I didn't have the athletic talent for me I thought well maybe I'll be escape order a little bit so it was just a variety of\nDifferent how about you ...\nYou know I've always loved soccer and wanted to play professional soccer but you know that that didn't become a reality in\nThe in the United states would and they were out there\nNow you might have a chance who knows they might yeah at forty three\nThey tend to fall apart a little bit later in life but interesting that both of you kind of wanted to go that sports track which might be how we ended up with a name winning with money here on the show are you competitive guys by nature\nI don't think to a fault like I've never like you know gotten kicked out of a little league baseball game yelling at six oh\nSo I've never like I have some friends that that's something that they've done and they try to keep the temperature control but I Am competitive I Want to do my best and I enjoy sports I enjoy the competition\nAs it burns and carry over to what you do for people now though I Know you actually get a reward out of helping people build a winning retirement I see your passion in your eyes when you talk about your clients here on the show but that that kind of influence your decision to kind of go this route and help people figure out this whole retirement\nThing I think both Matt and I were well educated and we believe in educating people and\nAnd that's one of the big passions that we have is helping people to help themselves and when people understand why they're doing certain things and why they need to make changes they can stick with a plan\nAnd it's very rewarding for us to watch and go through this process where we're making decisions together along the way and then we get there to see the smile on people's faces and the stress that gets relieved is ...\nProbably our greatest reward I Would say\nYeah I think my favorite is especially when the wife comes in and they finally get a plan that they can understand and that it falls in line with the you know being a little bit more conservative because\nSo you never have to take from the count that just got hit by the market even if it's just a temporary blip\nDoesn't have to be a long lasting blip but just a small blip can mess up and so having the ability to diversify the portfolio and pick from the right bucket makes a huge difference in how long your money last\nBut said this is a tricky part guys really figuring out that balance so today here on winning with money I Know for ten of our callers today we're actually going to do that detailed portfolio analysis and show you what are your chances of success based on what the market is dealing it really helps you understand\nThat sequence of return or is that a lot of early retirees face if you'd like to do that with us today give us a call you can do that right now it for eight zero six two zeroes sixty nine o seven\nAgain that's for eight zero six to zero sixty nine o seven\nAnd you're right guys I think a lot of people are surprised when they come in and they do that kind of detailed portfolio analysis with you they find out OK I'm taking a lot more risk than I should and I'm worried about those first few years especially of retirement and kind of smoothing out that ride but you have a number of different tools you can use to help people build that kind of balance strategy don't you\nEveryone is unique and the resources that they have available to them are going to be different the amount of income that they need is going to be different when they needed whether their accounts are\nMostly IRAs and for one k.'s and tax deferred or if they have other after tax investments um everything is individual and different and what we try to help people understand is that this is your retirement and no one's gonna care more about your retirement than you\nAnd so let's let's build a plan together that's going to meet your individual and specific needs and then we go about helping them understand that the stage of life that they're at by using like Matt was saying the sequence of returns and other vehicles to educate them\nTo help them understand that their number one enemy at this stage of their life has been market downturns\nAnd creating an income stream that's going to last as long as they do is is important and we need to develop that income stream or create a straw that's going to give them enough\nYou know income to come through that versus\nYou know as someone who's going out there and trying to breathe through a little tiny straw versus one that's a bigger one you're going to get is going to be a lot more comfortable if you have one where income coming in at a good rate and you're not worried about running out of air and so different vehicles provide that if you take a stock portfolio and you're very aggressive in it\nThe rule for a long time has been this four percent rule that says that over time you should be able to draw four percent off of a stock portfolio a lot of people are now adjusting that down to three three and a half percent because of the volatility\nThat's been in the market whereas there are vehicles out there I'm like annuities that can create it sometimes of five five and a half sometimes even six percent withdrawal rate that ...\nAnd can create more income from less and so understanding the vehicles that are out there and being able to apply them individually for a specific person and then\nCombining that with the tax implications and all that can be complicated but doable so that you can be efficient and make the dollars really count so that more is going to you versus Uncle Sam or to market volatility or downturns\nJust give me an example of that so I I was sitting down with a client that says passed a week that we're going through their plan and when we looked at their overall income needs\nWhen he sat down and said this is what I Need to be able to retire and he was a doctor and he had been stressed about this and he came basically to say my okay to put in my resignation and retire at the end of this year that was his goal and objective\nAnd so we sat down I said well if we look at what your pensions going to give you a profit sharing type pension through one of the practices that he had\nHe had Social Security and when we told all that up get generated about Seventy percent of the income that they are going to need okay they were still thirty percent short ...\nAnd so again if we left everything in the market for everything just stays in the market with that potentially could generate that return but like David Was saying because of the volatility of the market most of the time people are saying you should only take about three three and a half\nPercent out if you want to make sure that money last forever mhm so to make up that other thirty percent I told him I said look if we do that that means that about eighty percent of your money needs to remain in this account\nIt's money you shouldn't be spending from except for these monthly your annual withdrawals and if you have a larger expense we got to find it from a different bucket of money\nAnd so this is what we need to accomplish here and we said okay we could allocate some of these funds over to an annuity and immediately settle annuity I I've heard bad things about this I don't want to tie up my money I said well you realize that if we leave it all in the stock market eighty percent of that money is tied up\nIn air quotes here because they really can't\nTake that money and go and spend it because if they do they will not have that stream of income any longer mhm and so I said but if we take that same\nDollars we take only fifty percent of your money in allocated over into an annuity strategy because the annuities will pay out at four and five and six percent we can cover all of your income needs and free up another thirty percent of your money for you guys to spent however you want\n... and so from there the life will start coming on and then we go through that education process we start evaluating the different options what are the stock strategies where the bond strategies worthy annuity strategies\nThey potentially could put inside of their plan and so we're in the process of figuring out how much they want to allocate towards that\nAgain some people they can't get past allocating you know twenty thirty forty percent who knew the they're like oh I don't want to lock it up mhm but once we start educating them they see that that there's a benefit there and so will find that percentage that they're comfortable with and designed the plan with the other part of the money\nBut the key is is understanding what you're trying to accomplish and pick the right vehicles to accomplish that\nLove that you guys actually started planning process with that you take a look at what are your income needs are what are your goals for retirement what are the things you want to do then you build your strategy and you start to plan for that volatility as part of your comprehensive retirement plan that's the approach that Damon ... take with each and every client at a cue wealth advisors\nThey're having to do the same kind of thing for you today so that's why we're going to make that portfolio analysis complimentary for Chang callers on the today show\nIf you're wondering if you're doing the right things right now to actually meet your income needs for

you want that guaranteed income in retirement\nHow do you make that happen if you'd like to sign up for that today give us a call here in the next ten minutes at for eight zero six to zero sixty nine seven and we'll get you on the calendar for that\nWas David I'm mad in person the guy he mentioned you know there's so many different vehicles that you have to address longevity to address inflation during that long retirement today but you don't necessarily just built one plant around one annuity or one option do you\nHave actually have a client that is a perfect example so he came in he had heard it on the radio came in and sat down and when you open up his portfolio he had saved up a significant amount of work for Boeing and done very well\nBut he had about Ninety percent of his portfolio allocated to annuities at three different annuities an advisor told him that he had allocated to and I we talked about that and he was going to have a pension he was going to Social Security and so he didn't have a huge income need he was going to have some income needs but it wasn't going to be as much as he had allocated to that strategy\nSo one of the things that we implemented as we said OK these annuities are going to do their job but we have too much in that bucket\nAnd these annuities allow him to take out ten percent each year and so what we're doing is the money is growing inside of those annuities\nBut each and every year we're taking advantage of that ten percent free withdrawal and were rolling money out of that account okay and we're putting that over into some more liquid have vestments is still going to be growing but it's going to be available for him and his wife to tap into in larger sums if they should need them\nAnd we're going to do that over the next five or six years by the time that gets done we should have a very balanced approach she'll still have some money allocated to annuity strategy\nBut he's going to actually have more outside the annuity that he's going to be able to tap in and use for some of the bucket list items for some of the larger purchases that they might have during retirement yeah so it's going to give them more flexibility so the critical aspect to a financial plan is balance\nToo much of one thing can cause you lack of flexibility to be able to manage and be able to adjust for what might come in the future\nSo it's very critical that you have balance and that's what I Do is we do that evaluation we kind of run through and figure out what you need what book that you need to have inside of your financial plan and then we can suggest options and help you position that portfolio in the right way\nBecause David nomad understand finding that balance it's crucial for your retirement and it's not necessarily about one solution versus another it can be a combination of strategies and that's why we call it building a comprehensive retirement plan\nAt a key wealth advisor so if you're wondering

the stories to love your actual clients those who have come in to you for help because I think a lot of people see themselves and the kinds of stories that we discuss here on the show and today we focus on a single guy for our case study here his name is Jim ... sixty and uh he has some federal benefits that writes\nIt is he's a postal worker okay hum has been doing that for Twenty years in a year's singles very eligible regular guy in L. A. [laughter]\nUm but you know everybody comes in a for different reasons as they listen to the radio show and he'd been listening for a couple of months and\nHe came in and you know I was asking what caught your attention what is it that that you want to accomplish in in coming and visiting with us and you know he said I I don't have children or my goal isn't to leave a whole bunch of money but I'm I don't know if I have enough\nTo retire I'm thinking I Want to retire in the next three to six years he said hunting on how I'm feeling about working which boss I have no whatever and you know he wanted to know when it would be the best time to take Social Security\nAnd then he had some questions about taxes how that was going to affect you know him now with the new cuts and then into retirement and so we kind of um sat down and said well let's look at what you have 'em and you know his expenses are are low they're only about twenty five hundred dollars a month these paid off his home so that's one of the reasons why they're low\nBut he hadn't done anything to avoid probate on that home or or have a wheel or any of those things done\nWhich are important to have you want to make sure that your family can take care of you in the event that\nSomething happens to use those your power attorney documents and then ... and beneficiary deeds and all that stuff you had some questions about they didn't have done but then you know asking well how are you doing and contributing said that he was contributing the full amount which was about twenty four thousand dollars to his T S P plan which is like a four O. one K. plan is just a government one ha ha and\nHe also was a putting some of that into the CSP Ross so he was paying some of the tax now\nAnd then we also had another portfolio with a a larger brokerage house that ah he was having someone managed and who's paying about one point one\nPercent to have somebody manage those accounts over there and overall there was about five hundred thousand dollars that was being managed and so we had you know just some different accounts at a decent savings and and even had a CD in there\nAnd so that's kind of where where we started we looked at this is what he has now let's identify if there's any problems and go forward from there\nIn his situation again his income was low he's going to have a good pensions so he already had kind of his income needs taking care of in retirement\nAnd so for him it was really just kind of figuring out okay\nHow has the money invested how should it be invested in what is your plan for being able to spend that because again he doesn't have any kids he doesn't have to worry about\nTaking care of a wife and so really it's about you know how can he spend this money and it'd be great if you could spend it when he was younger and more active and travel and do things opposed to you know be an eighty years old with a pile of money and wishing you could do stuff and not having to help to do it\nSo the first thing that we did is we started doing the analysis so again he has a T SPA account\nWhere he has limited options because he's a federal employee and there's only those five different phones that he can invest in\nBut then he also had this other account that was being managed and what we wanted to look at was how much risk was he taking what kind of volatility was experiencing was appropriate and then more importantly what were the fees that he was pain because he was paying someone to manage it but what additional fees were being charged\nBecause again that's a common mistake a lot of people think well you know he said like I said he's charging me one percent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dave Ramsey Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "13"}
