Phyllis is founder and president F. P. S. P. N. associates she was the first\nFemale advisor on the cover a senior market advisors magazine she was recently runner up advisor of the year for that publication check out the website if you'd like to learn more it's retire with P. S. T. dot com\nOn the show today we're talking about things to think about so you can plan for specific retirement goals and fill us you told us a little bit ago about this couple who came in to work with you and one of their retirement and goals was to go on a world cruise so how\nDo you go about playing something like that\nSo first of all here's the thing that I really want to get across that they wanted to do it but it kind of came out in conversation they didn't realize that doing something to significant like that above and beyond just normal goals was a huge undertaking and they need to not that they couldn't do it in the right to be\nPlanned for head of time to make it a reality and so as it came out I started saying things like and this is an important part of working with a retirement plan or somebody who's just not going to say OK how much you're going to need and retirement\nI started saying oh oh that's a really cool goal so where do you want to go\n... and they weren't necessarily sure they knew they wanted to take a boat oh well how long do you think it's going to be for and how do you pack for that and what's it going to cause the what's how many places just the question is offered this all this and they started the first step was\nThey've got that you know it could be expensive but the second step was is they really didn't have those answers so\nFirst thing that they had to go back to the drawing board before we can really make sure that we're planning correctly for this big goal was to research how to go about booking this now and what the difference between so they actually ended up working\nWith a travel agent who had an itch yet in doing this and they spent a lot of time comparing and contrasting what it would look like and then came back with a realistic expectation of time what they really wanted to do an expectation of cost\nAnd then once we had that now we could back into\nHow we planned accordingly right and like I told you in the first segment and their particular case in order to do everything that they wanted to do and air travel agent this is their niche customize as best they could you know found the right cruise line the whole ten yards which they had that we realize that if they\nYou know really wanted to do what they wanted to do they needed to put it off for a while and\nOne of the best ways was for the husband to you know just do some part time work for a while and just save that money and they were so excited that they had a plan for it not just with me but with the travel agent and all came about by really you know just\nProactively pondering it ahead of time and and that's yeah\nSo I Will say that is our niche when someone comes in to us and we sit down and and start talking about retirement it's not just how much do you want to spend\nEight months what do you think it's going to cause for retirement it's really going through what those goals are going to look like two people take a cruise are not going to do it the same way one's going to take Viking in one's going to take a less expensive cruise so we got to dive\nIn and we got to know that on the front and that is so so so important to success in retirement and knowing what we need knowing what it's going to cost us to the best of our ability planning for inflation and then\nOnce we have that later\nThan looking at what we've accumulated and building a plan that supports those goals\nSo yeah it was an interesting process and that's what we do with every day and sometimes people are really surprised when we sit down with them and we start talking oh you like the Gulf\nSo what does that look like for you you want to spend time Gulf and what does that look like for you you know how many times a week do you want to golf do golf as part of a club what types of course is do you like to golf at all\nPeople just are going to go to the specials you know look at home with that but I'm going to spend a lot less some people are going to address the heart of the ball to a club they're going to want to go to every golf course out there as good cost them a lot more than someone who's going to go out in the summer early in the morning you know or the heat of the day and they're going to get specials\n... yeah yeah it's just part of\nFiguring out what the exact goals are so you can figure out what needs to be done to help accomplish the goals and Phil is I feel like I've joked before about travel agents not really being a thing anymore but that's not true\nThey are just highly specialized now if you want to do a world cruise as this couple wanted to do there is a travel agent who specializes in those things understanding the logistics understanding\nWhat you need to know for each country you will visit and what the timeline will look like and how to pack and what to think about before you go\nIf you want to go on a European river crews there somebody who specializes in European river cruises that's all they do it's all they focused on and they're the best at that\nAnd I think it's important to point out that kind of how it is in the world of finance also you specialize in retirement planning if you were looking to grow your income and focus on growth a little bit more you want to work with somebody who specializes in that not retirement planning right\nAbsolutely night and day like you if you realistically want to hurt those buffalo one day she wants to do that\nYou want to accumulate as much money as you can to reach that goal and it is all about growth you have to pay check coming in that's going to pay your bills now but you want to be diligent savers\nAnd as you transition into retirement what you've accumulated you've got to put it in the smartest places to make sure those dreams become a reality right just you know retirement and general becomes a reality and that is a focus\nTotally different goals totally different set of strategies totally different sets of tools there are no tools that are created you know not everybody's going to want to use the same tools but\nYeah we got to break that down and it really in our specialty it really starts with understanding\nReally delving in to how you want it to be and then really educating you about exactly where you are in relationship to your goals to see if there's any any gaps retire fit analysis does exactly that we take the time\nTo understand how you want to play golf where you want to play or how you want to take a cruise\nWhat you want to do with your grandchildren do you know we were talking about Disney how you went to the N O L I took my kids to ... what do you want that experience to look like because it was cute but you said your parents wanted to buy each of your kids the soda whereas you have it sharing it [laughter]\nYeah if I Want to buy each of my kids grandbabies a soda or if that's important to me that costs a lot more than if we're gonna share one yeah all of those things on the front end to make it to see if it's a reality\nThe retired fit analysis does into that that it takes a look at everything going on in your plan as it is now educates you on any gaps\nAnd then if there are gaps that you want to fit we can show you how to do that with the tools that exists\nBut it all starts with if you've done the heavy lifting saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement come to us we're specialist let's sit down and let's start that conversation let's get that go on and make sure you're on track for your dreams your realities\nBut pick up the phone and call us with a retired fit analysis at six to three seven Ninety two fifty four Ninety six again that number is six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six\nPhyllis ... is founder and president have ESPN associates\nI'm generally Zach along side in the studio\nFill us what about those who have already tried to start putting some of these things together maybe they've tried to start looking at some different products may be things like annuities are maybe different life insurance policies\nDo people like that need to get a second opinion to make sure they have started to get the right things in place or what do you recommend for somebody who's already tried to do a little bit of it on their own\nOh absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely whether you're working with somebody or whether you're doing it yourself listen\nThe worst the best thing that can happen is you come on and and we talk about what your dreams are new realities and your budget is going to be like we lay it out we doing analysis of where you are and you're on trapped we're going to shake your head\nOr you are on track we're going to shake your hand and we're going to part friends we're going to give you all of our analysis that's what we do however if you started that process and you realize that\nOf thinking of one couple that came in to see us and they said yeah you know we don't want any bills in retirement\nSo we're not ready to downsize our house but we got a significant mortgage that served us well well we were working because we're right off from it now that we're retired we're going to take money and pay off the mortgage\nI'm like okay where's that going to come from what they would take it out of their four O. one K. throw themselves into a significantly higher tax rate that they weren't prepared for have to pay a lot more taxes than they thought\nTrigger the Medicare part B ND going up significantly and by the time we were done they had a different outlook on that that's why you need a second opinion based upon what you want to do\nPhyllis ... is founder and president of the SPN associates I'm generally jak alongside in the studio Phyllis just gave me the phone number the website as retire with the S. P. dot com\nIf you'd like to learn a little bit more\nPhyllis tell me how this conversation goes when you have someone who you've been working with them for a while on their retirement plan\nThey gave you a call and they say hey fellas I Need to fifty thousand dollars\n[laughter] what's the conversation that happens from there how do you figure out whether or not this makes sense and where that money comes from\nSo I'd like to believe I'm pretty sure that I Can't think of any situation other than a health care crisis we're all of a sudden out of the blue hey I Need fifty thousand more we do it on the front end okay I'm not going to say that life doesn't happen and that we do enough to make shifts in monitoring a plan\nBut when you build a solid plan on the front end\nYou understand you know what their goals are going to be in retirement and your plans for the worst you have a health care plan you know to the best of our abilities you have a tax strategy so we really don't get those calls unless we planned for it and we've put enough away on the emergency side of that happened out of the blue\nI don't know what I Do because it should it shouldn't just hey we decided to take a fifty thousand no vacation\nYou know we would try but that's necessarily a list someone's really really really got a lot less to the side we would flush it out on the front it ... never say never that plan is going to be about okay we take our time on that\nBecause we can see the likelihood like I told you again going back to that couple you know I was kind of new to these conversations about you know retirement planning\nAnd just in the course of that conversation that started coming up if they wanted to do that and the flushing out how much that was going to cost a started to realize that conversations have to go deeper in the front and sometimes people are really surprised how long it will take to just get through those goals but I don't rush it it's so important we have to have that\nRight right gotta take your time with us in and asking the right questions is important on your part is well let's go ahead and take another break when we come back we'll wrap up this discussion today we've been talking about how to plan for specific retirement goals how'd you identify those goals\nAnd then how do we help you achieve them in retirement will wrap this up after the break we'll be back after that [noise]\nWhat's your financial planning and work is done through the tax efficient fever is written manage inflation adjusted income generating for the rest of your life\nSure well then it's time to talk to an advisor about creating a retirement strategy you can be confident and make sure you choose wisely avenue Sherry someone who would do the highest legal duty of care to focus is exclusively on adults in in your retirement and his methods and values fitness yours\n... is the host of financially fit with Phyllis do share even over thirty three years experience navigating clients any financial climate fulfilling today and six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six\nInsurance charities are ... from ... legal by individuals are encouraged to Wal Mart Russia investment advisor service officer ... central services Arizona registered advisor those will be also a bit of Arizona [noise]\nThank you for joining us today this is retire financially fit with Phyllis I'm your hosts generally jak here alongside Phyllis ... she founder and president at the at the end associates retire with\nS. T. dot com is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more today we've been talking about how to plan for specific retirement goals and all sorts\nAnd also talking about some way you can achieve those goals and retirement and tell us it's really all about having a plan it's about having an idea of what you're wanting to accomplish in retirement and then the strategy to get there to tell me a little bit more\nAbout the planning process what are the components what are you looking for in a retirement plan\nHere so I knew each week I have a plan have a plan when we've heard slaying yeah I Want to scream it I really do want to scream it from the rooftop that no I don't believe that people realize necessarily early enough that all the rules\nChange from that first face to the second face some so what I mean is the working is like you and\nYour heard of [laughter] of buffalo I keep saying you are hurting buffer hurting [laughter] from the first segment Jeff your wants third buffalo N.Y anti but\nSerious say you're accumulating for that right now and and your strategy needs to be growing the money that you save\nGoing up and mountain yup go up to them\nAs you get into retirement or you get close to retirement\nYou've accumulated that number and by the way depending upon your lifestyle determines how much that number has today there is no magic bullet guys the million dollar number ... works for ... not necessarily for others it really matters what you want to do retirement\nOkay so I'm going to dispel that but what I Want anybody saving for retirement to do is have put away that money and know that yeah you've got to turn that into a paycheck if you want a nice lifestyle you've got to do the heavy lifting and be a discipline saver\nAnd you want it to grow as much but the next phase as you start planning for a time when you get into retirement\nWe've got to look at things differently it is not just about growing your money okay you've got to take that money and you've got to have a plan that consists of first\nOf all really knowing what you want me time to look like what that is going to cost so if you're gonna travel how are you going to travel how often you going to travel what generally spend and travel I mean really drilling down on\nThat so that there's no disappointments so that you don't have surprises on that and they'll always be some little surprises but that's very essential having a budget that we know what are the things we're absolutely want to do when we retire\nYou know maybe you want to take that trip around the world but if you can it's OK let's flush that out on the front and then how do we build a plan to sustain your goals realistically when we got to have income we got to have income to replace the paycheck\nInflation adjusted income because inflation never sleep I don't care about the consumer price index being low you're going to find out in retirement I've been doing this a long time that\nThings go up more than you think yeah yeah you've got to have raised is just like while you're working you get raises you got to have the same thing in retirement so we've got to have a solid income plan and that incomes going to come in whether\nThe market's up down sideways so we've got to make really good decisions about having reliable income to support our goals\nThey got to make a great decision about how to take pensions okay we got to look at your lungs jeopardy we got to look at your lifestyle if you're married do you take the money in a lump sum oftentimes people can take their pensions if they even have it\nIn a lump sum does that make sense upon your goals\n... great for an advisor to take that money and invest it before you get paid but doesn't really make sense for you let's explore that as part of the income playing and Social Security\nMy goodness don't make a knee jerk decision with Social Security we've got to make a decision for you the best claiming strategy based upon everything that you have going on in your retirement plan I could have ten people come in in a week and look at Social Security claiming strategies and they're going to be very very different\nYou know I'm thinking back real quickly to last week we had one couple come in and their strategy when we looked at it what made the most sense the best probability of success and their situation was\nFor the lower earner to take their Social Security early and let the higher earners take their Social Security at full retirement age then I had another couple that came in and\nThey're both going to take their Social Security at full retirement that I had another couple coming in and they're both going to take their Social Security as soon as they're eligible because we looked at the whole picture\nBut the bottom line is based upon the whole picture we want to make sure that we squeeze out the most income from Social Security because it is a great tool to work with the we got to have an income when we got to have an investment strategies that support\nStrategies that support your income goals as well as your goals and five or ten years in your long term goals we've got to make sure that that investment strategy does what you needed to do we\nJust don't want to have performance goals we want to have\nGoals that support what we need our money to do you know I had someone come in last week and they're do it yourself or isn't idling insult anybody but they're making twelve percent on their money and the good market and they're all excited about that\nBut you know what they need some income from that money now and when I did it analysis is tomorrow's two thousand ... their portfolio could go down over thirty seven percent\nI don't know that that's appropriate so we want to make sure that the investment strategy supports what they're working on that's another important piece and boy if I said it was to say at a hundred times get Saddam Hussein

historical in contemporary\nWould we are still fighting the civil war most people forget that or didn't know you don't recognize it but it was still there\nWill bear that I'm On on you know there are and that and of course Minnesota being in the ... uh and and the state which I think we're going to say a lot of ah a lot of contest in\n... and then by the way I just interject in that one that was a state most people didn't notice when Trump carry the upper Midwest it did not include Minnesota but he only missed by half a point so it's very much a swing state\nYeah so he ... he'll be in their funding and and then of course a way very interested in ... in the mid west and moving across the I guess what you might call a rust belt states where are the Democrats did so poorly in the last presidential campaign particularly Pennsylvania uh and\nI think if we do that we'll get a good sense of ... of where Americans are to die we're not really interested in what's happening in LA would not really concerned about a New York we know what's gonna happen there but we do want to know what's happening in the south a very important parts of America the destroying the audiences see\nVery little ... even less about\nWell I I ride I heard about this enterprise or one of the things I first thought I was in the early Nineteen century uh Alexis de Tocqueville came to America this French guy wrote what for about two centuries was considered\nThe definitive work on American culture in American politics\nAnd uh most people feel that you had to not be an American in order to do that you have to be from the outside\nTo recognize things that within a country you might take as a given so given that background in and high bar or what have you been to southern Arizona you been to the border bend it to send come up here any impression so far that hold\nThe Labour Party on the left and the liberal potty which is really the ... on the rise and and most people tend to break more towards the conservatives on this issue and\nWhat is the non white population of Australia now [noise]\nAh well it's still very small or ... the ... a good eighty percent of the sky and population would come from a European back room\nBut that's still about that if it was zero I mean that's still a that's still a big cultural change over essentially a generation it ... it's being how many how much bigger for example than the increase that we're seeing even though the Mexican or Hispanic population in this country is increasing that's that's bigger the bigger change\nThe biggest change in a shorter period something which was saying in Europe as well as ... as as a mass exodus of people out of places like Syria and North Africa a is changing the politics in Europe as well it's had that effect and the strategy to some extent but still the major parties taint\nOr to try to keep a bit of a lid on it they don't try to stay at it and of course there are significant migrant communities in stride as who you know you have to be careful about offending with some of that sort of rhetoric\nUm but it all sorts of things that happen you know obviously we've become a much more a more diverse community and much more interesting community many wise ... people from all around the world living with us but there has been some ... pots of major cities like Sydney\nOr which we don't think it's necessarily a healthy thing but pains to happen when the big population movements\nIn originally short period of time how long is the path to citizenship for an immigrant\nOr it can be several years and I can be a detainee is um my brother for example is married to a ... a moment they've got two children are still after about five years living in this race still hasn't managed to even marrying marrying and history and does not guarantee your citizenship in the in The Simpsons because\nFrankly there are a lot of people who are marrying out of convenience in order to gain citizenship said that's not allowed you have to go through all sorts of tests including\nProving that showed that some of my marriage yeah sorted would that's the same\nHere yeah in fact they're they're pretty rigorous about that\nYeah and I started to so it's tightening up but about one she'd do become the strength to Disneyland titled tool of benefits of citizenship\nAnd voting and and what I was really getting at was the issue of voting because if that path is short these immigrants become a voting group and then that changes in the politics\nIt does and uh but they don't necessarily always vote with one ... or ... depending on the country they come from their politics can be very different I you know for a long time in history even before ... Seventy two we had a a large influx of of migrants from Eastern Europe\nAnd they tended to be very right wing and their politics cars are reacting to the ... and I supported the the liberal potty whereas migrants from other countries\nAnd the liberal parties the conservative and yes and and when he had I now live around saying why I'd make conservative out and that's true of most of the world than liberal is the more conservative because they're they they left wing party is the labor party exactly and\nSo that tends to have a more social democratic found a connotation about it more directed towards a welfare state orientation and an ...\nSocial democratic as left wing or and then I'm a Christian Democratic is usually from the right exactly you are a host of Europe\nYeah so uh what other observations what strikes you in terms of differences between the countries\nWell apart from the ... and it's remarkable diversity ... in the United states I\nI I I think the the fact that you'll you'll politics has played out at a at a very aggressive level in election campaigns\nAre just watching the TV coverage them over the last few nights and I uh I watch one ad and break where there was six ads and five of them were political and all of them were negative\nHighly negative and I think that in terms of the political culture or even though a stray is still has a pretty robust a given taek I think ah American politics is taking it to another level\nAnd of course I'm you tend to be working more to your vice all the time trying to excite\nUh the feelings of either the Democratic uh buys all the Republican base the latter\nIs a relatively recent phenomenon and we have become so polarized that for all intents and purposes but middle disappears the old admonition used to\nOld admonition used to be run to the left or to the right in your own primary to get the nomination and then race to the middle east and a\nIs a question of whether or not there's a ... a middle left but to to rise to yeah ... and and and I guess one of the things that way of looking at is\nIs to what is an American\nAn hour could fit the loan against the from the by that what is happening in

the male mailing went out this week so and so it changes the way your campaign well among other contrast that with the U.S not only do we not have compulsory boating we have pre registration required in some states you can register on election day but not in most states\nVoter id requirements polling places only in certain places polling or people that move\nA may find themselves unregistered because here in a different district here registration no longer counts a over incarceration and restriction of voting from prior felons which runs into the millions it's not a small number\nA and what are called voluntary suppression not voting by choice that's there's a lot of obstacles to voting in this country\n... it's interesting and and and when it's done deliberately uh I think that's a terrible thing ah because I think we should be trying to encourage people to participate in the Democratic system I mean in the United states the greatest democracy in the world I'm In my opinion aid should be there to encourage people to vote at all the times and it becomes a political\nSatire and sometimes a political strategy is to deliberately uh suppress the vote of those who are opposed to you if you can somehow make them turned off enough that they won't vote that's part of the political strategy not unlike you you mentioned negative campaigning the sad fact is that it works in that's why we're\nIn including people who say that they people say they hate negative campaigning and then you ask them who here while I wouldn't vote for them because of this this in this in their power back with it for them and\nThey I mean I I as a campaigner myself is set in focus groups and showing them positive ads and negative ads and they pulled up the negative ads and they say well at the end of it well what are the ... all of that ad that negative ads really changed my mind about Canada Day while he's us combat show I I wouldn't vote for him but I hear you know it's not just the politicians they're encouraged by elected to the heat fan\n[laughter] one more thing I I Would like to talk about ah we have are just a minute or two instant runoff voting a you have a system whereby people select nominally first choice but second choice and I I look at that and said well the impact of that is\nYou for example could see people in this country as a you know I'm a I'm a Green Party advocate but\nYou know if I vote green I may elect the Republican where it's all of their votes would almost usually go to Democrats conversely a libertarian votes would second choice would be Republican\n... ... and and some people do rile a little bit against that in the strike but once again it's pot and possible death system and it avoids the need for a runoff election where where where people are going to already been eliminated and you're going to have to perhaps five fewer second\nChoice and let me just take a minute to explain because I'm sure a lot of people don't know what that is you would you'd pick your first choice and if your first choice comes in last on the ballot reading\nThen your vote gets re allocated in the second round to your ... so you get the opportunity to have an expressive vote safer a minority party candidate without having you're having the effect of that being to elect a person that you liked the least\nExactly and what happens at the polling places as the political parties have volunteers hanging out with ... which have the suggested order of voting according to their preferences\nCivil libertarians might say All right vote for us but then you know if we get limited to make your second choice of the republic exactly\nAnd and and so as long as you've got people who couldn't get to the polling place to hand out those cuts or that will reflect ... ... the intention of the political party when we scrutiny or in elections you'll say\nPeople just voting the ticket constantly constantly but uh so it again it doesn't tend to make too much difference to the wind which are elections I I I decided it just means that are on the die then they decided and sometimes as a high a\nLevel of formality and that but if people get their numbers wrong you know like I Want to do for\nA radically it should make no difference but in practice when you have a runoff ... you can sometimes change the dynamic\nSeem date yeah and and and I and I don't think a preferential voting of itself is is the most critical things in the world but first puff the Post's biting can also create some you know recently on a normal as a result as well as somebody wins an election with thirty five to six percent of the vote\nBecause at one stings in Arizona those of us have been around there long enough to remember ever make 'em elected governor what thirty some odd percent of the vote\nA ... percent of the vote and the interesting thing and I told you this and the break but uh for our readers haven't been here that long uh\nHe he was elected with thirty eight percent it's entirely fractious period ends up getting impeach but uh so the legislature refers to the voters proposal next time we need a majority vote when you're the majority\nAnd in the very next election or ... runs against by ... and get something like forty nine point eight percent Jerry ... gets forty nine point seven and we have to have a meaningless ... I'm a run off where\nLo and behold five so I'm Indian wins again by a fraction of what in other words replicating the boat we'd already had\nA you know I think that the answer you could have come up with but nobody could have justified is All right you need at least say forty five percent or something but exactly of course any number like that other than the majority will be arbitrary\nBut the truth is there any way it they're they're all sorts of pops to democratic out dumb ... around the world are over ... around the Democratic well there are also two ways of electing governments\nAnd

we're going to college and so that's probably going to take everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights houses probably on hold for a little while\nWhen you've got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up to the right Yes sir\nOf Ramsey solutions sunny from San Diego California drop by and a question I mean what's\nHi Mr Ramsey plus fall it's such a right to speak to you um\nAnd my question is I've just immigrated to the United states and I've lived a frugal life I'm like save my money ... but since I've lived in the United states um I've had a ... some of my acquaintances telling me\nI'm deal frugal living will make your social loud cost you ... if you'd done by an expense of laws and expensive cars and all of a status symbol mhm are you will be treated as a social ... on what would be your take on that [laughter] I Love it [laughter]\nOr did your emigrated from a United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old a twenty nine okay and how long did you live in the u._k. eleven years were you a social outcasts there um no [laughter]\nWell ah where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice ... a a very legitimate shitty and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal now but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nOh there it is [laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now I'm getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have common sense as well so um I don't know what crowd you're running with there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an baths for sure [noise]\nUm because they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism\nBut plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider us social out cash for having good common sense values now or that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm worth\nGo well over ten million dollars buildings worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch it pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks\nI'm problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool because I have a watch I don't think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you\nUm and where you want to end up so what brought you\nTo the United states why did you come here\nIt was um a childhood dream that I had ... um I read somewhere that um\nBecause this country guarantee freedom to all people to Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to recite the pledge of allegiance and that just got hold of me I was about twelve years old and I try to uh apply that\nIn my school and then get a get a naive I was ... I'm In the American constitution doesn't apply in India [laughter] and I actually got um the pizza floored me out to get in trouble yeah I did I attended the principal and the fact of the principal one day when I make it to the United states you won't be able to do this to me anymore\nSo freedom at is correct freedom okay and now people are\nTrying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not all\nOkay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought through you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom that have tried to stuff\nNot all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by things that you have or aware or not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so um the very people you might attract by having some bling\nBy having some jewelry or some watches the proper clothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge price to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character and\nI'm the I'm ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want 'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them\nBut if I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live ... ... you and so forth um and show you know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character in orange\nA little more depth of character in order to judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you're driving a car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial goal or something more needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have been and managed them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things I'd buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me\nAnd so I I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of this year is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that that'll come what are you doing for a living I'm looking IT IT okay what do you do a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to nice when work rush\n[laughter] Saudis in order to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story Weldon thanks for stopping by open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five and this was the day Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up\n[noise] um I wanted to ask if I should say my tax cut here and she reported off information um on our Seventeen pack there's another without being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars and penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalties yeah okay so it's a show like a percentage on the information mhm as well that\nFalse information sheet allied intentionally and you get through that\nYeah why we're doing is\nI guess to get back more money I don't know like frankly she claimed that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that they are paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird yeah I mean does your husband have something to do with this when\nHe doesn't have hit that we could see where\nNo I mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have cars you don't have a knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have a church but you know trickle down a path so there was no there's nothing in them the documentation and Internet anything about the church they use our uh our number of aid that high but when the number is ... this random\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one C. three as of venture lists that you're being paid uh outside of the church no\nYou're not you don't do speaking engagements shouldn't get paid for that on the side\nNo everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and even for they charge me don't make any money for the truck you could only in states\nBoth work independently ... not the company\nI say you have your by vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I don't I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question 'cause I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this was a very bizarre thing\nSomeone would do is just out of the blue ... it's not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication and so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you've signed the tax returns though didn't you\nKnow everything you know but you had to see the ...\nYou you you didn't allow someone to send in tax returns are due to see Shirley Hi you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and ask them a hot my guess is the most you could hope to get back will be the penalties\nThe taxes you on the radio and you still owe the penalties are due to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back\nDid you know that if you combined the data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised or hacked\nFor fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once to this is unbelievable once they get your info the risks never goes away and they can use it whenever and however they choose it truly has become an issue of not if\nWith the car because we happen to own one of the vote ...\nWas handle yeah you know and\nYeah and they were offering us you know we can do the five after that and we were planning to keep it\nBut I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the buy back and got the cash settlement got rid of the payment and the position that would put a than it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off and thirty six months\nAnd thought about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back on him what I've been doing and he said he would buy us feel\nUm for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would text pets but not today to talk to him and I was a little nervous 'cause the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he'd\nGo you're going to the mini van driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the minivan but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like well I told him about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\n... um and I\nThought you were you were ready to you are sick of this\nOh absolutely\nYeah yeah yeah and then you come home and you guys go to financial position or city\nBut we didn't end up going to what we did it um through the program at home home study I got you yeah our church has an hour and a half away and run run\nNot now nowadays you can just watch it all on line but it was different then yeah very good you guys don't want is key to getting into that you may not maybe one thousand Eighteen months ... for\nAll the votes like in the world they paid off\nThe loan ten thousand and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one most yes All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt and you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um\nI Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than in the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nMhm which she she did as good a job as I could possibly expect\nExactly what she was by herself but she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how was\nBeing done exactly where we were our new small numbers I did\nNot have the big picture and you know guys being visual creatures disparate she gave me the big picture and the color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a you lost some of the control when a not in law but you've gained um someone else's shoulders to carry the load right\nYes yeah it became amazing actually what happened with pat with this was beyond flabbergasted me because\nHe got so on board that what and and God on if we had a huge impact on this because he was told there'd be no more extensions and that was back like just a few months before we started and then I'm about to\nBe about a year into it he gets a call ... he was home during one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they just got back three weeks before but they want to needed him to come back a month early and he\nGets off the phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like I don't know you want to go back and he's like what what what to do with our debt inside we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating and\nI'm like you know what if you do this we can be out of debt in June um instead of you know another year and a half and it was like\nWow I didn't think he jumped on board and he he actually told them that he extended for the the month you know if they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee us to get it all paid off in that time\nCongratulations you guys were so you think you've got a copy of course

recognized you as the former mayor\nI Do not think that he recognized me I think I was just because I was leaving the restaurant by myself uh I I think he saw me as a as a target\nFormer ah Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton joining us he was robbed outside of restaurant over the weekend a guy who was holding a ... and one at all his money I'm so today we find out that please the Phoenix law enforcement association\nSaid this incident was a result of your decisions during your seven years as mayor I guess they're saying hey you know what\nYou didn't get enough police officers on the force I think they were pointing to the fact that the department is still struggling to fill nearly two hundred vacant positions and and I think mayor ... ... he was saying you didn't do anything about this this is your fault what is your response to plead\nWell first off I'm you know as it relates to the unfortunate incident that occurred to me on Saturday Night at the uh uh at the restaurant that was a completely random a incident could have happened to uh to any one so I I I don't want to in any regard talk about\nMy uh the random incident that occurred to me as it relates to\nA larger issues of the uh in the city I Will say this bill a look when I became mayor\nThis city did have a six year hiring freeze in place I inherited that you know what we did we came up with a very aggressive police hiring a plan and we put into the budget ... ability to hire four hundred and fifty more officers unfortunately as you know\nWe can't even hire people to fill the slots that had been a lot of in the city budget\nAs you know we also fully funded a police body camp for every single patrol officer or are in the in the city of Phoenix if I can be honest there they are endorsing calcium and wait for mayor\nUsing the exact same record that I had as mayor of the city of terms of developing this very strong police hiring a a plan\nSo I saw what they put out but the reality is is is that I inherited the hiring freeze and it was under my time as mayor that we put in place the very aggressively tiring plan that we have in place right now\nMere stand you think that's a cheap shot by police that they they're using the incident that happened to you to try and put a spotlight on uh we still have vacant positions over at the Phoenix police departments that a cheap shot at you you think I Know\nA bacon I respect every single woman and man who represents the ... in uniform as an officer I've always tried to act in a hundred percent professional way and again tried it as much support for those officers as possible by\nA restoring the last pay that was lost during the worst of the recession and by putting into place\nIs very aggressive public safety plan that allows for the hiring of up to four hundred and fifty new officers into the the police department again we can't even right now find the people to to fill the positions that had been budget in the city or the ...\nA a budget and I am glad that they've endorsed a Kennedy\nIn the Phoenix mayor's race using the policies that I passed as mayor of the of the city of the city of Phoenix and so I'm not going to use any terms like a cheap shot they they can you can\nCharacterize it any way they want I'm proud of my record as mayor the city the next I'm proud of my public safety a record as you know\nViolent crime in the city or the next is down a thirty percent over the last twenty five years uh and so the city and the next is a save a city and I say that even if someone that unfortunately has been a victim\nSpeaking of safety uh we're talking with us congressional candidate former Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton\nWe know that President Trump is coming to town is coming to a makes a gateway international airport what advice would you have for the Mesa mayor on how to handle the president of the United states and we remember what happened last August when the protests and what happened downtown what advice would you tell him\nWell first off I sat at the time\nThat I think it was appropriate for President Trump to come to Phoenix because it was so shortly after the tragedy of what happened in Charlottesville a and that's the reason why they appropriate but then when people say well why don't you shut down the convention center I said no\nI'm this is America and people have a right to use public facilities to make whatever political state but they they uh they want to make it right I Know that makes it may or may or jobs is a great guy I work very closely together\nDuring the time that I was a mayor I Know he'll handle the situation\nA fried rice in town and I don't want anyone to go there because of this unfortunate incident\nNuts I totally get it thanks a lot [laughter] I think you know you know what you don't want a restaurant getting he's right do you don't want they don't want to go up you you don't want to suffer because this could happen anywhere\nAnd I think that's kind of a cool thing that the ... the former mayor just said don't stop going to a restaurant just rise a high profile guy like him a hatch it was ... by the way\nWe've had we not standing on two occasions over the last seven or eight years yeah that are bizarre we brought him in Studio when when he broke his nose he was playing with the mercury yeah and he caught an elbow going up for a while right and he's bleeding
