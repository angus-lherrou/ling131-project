first of all congratulations to you and your teammates and and you are coming back to United Center where you played for a couple of years you didn't playing the game here last year\nBut you came in and and really were unbelievable tonight man thirty three saves your teammates were great what a what a big victory just your thoughts about this when\nObviously obviously a big a big game for the whole team and and you know we've got a good start there and\nUh we didn't give that that many great looks in in in the first half of the game day they got a few times in the end of chicken period but I think overall we we're playing really\nReally well and then a few times where there was a battery bombs from from me and you know our guy was usually over the first one day or so so everybody was doing craft shop in front of me and that usually helps you\nTo play play good and and get the rest of the results\nThere are so so everybody was doing great shop in front of me and that usually helps you to play play good and and get the rest of the results what do we what we got today\nRocks I'm responsible for picking the favor the game [noise]\nYou you have a favorite particular that you could pick in your head that you thought was your best one I Want to see if we match up here\nThere was a couple of good once in a second episode I've won a\nOne way or [noise] but I I think you're going to go with the third third period when they got the the\nBeat on all go back to the second pair up okay back to the second part well there is if you do too and in the second where I read the play a little bit\nWrong and then I Need to stretch it out and I'm headed straight to the cloud but I think you're you're meeting I Would say that the decree quick playing in front of the networks ... days got that one time or there I think that was pretty important one\nI thought it was a cross body kept one where you made that beautiful gloves see that's what I have pets but I thought you had a a definitely a couple of ten ... tonight I thought you were really good on on on finding the puck through screen so sort of credit to you buddy for being on the same page as\nWas not the case tonight at although\nThey give the Blackhawks their first regulation loss of the season the ... in the process pick up their first regulation when of the year\nAnd how about the former Blackhawks the got it done for the coyotes and this one you had Vinnie industry Rosa two goals including the game winner or Jordan ... says Nicolas ... twenty two minutes Eighteen seconds of ice time that was more than any other coyote\nOnto your on to thirty three saves gets the when he's been outstanding all season and a Richard panic three shots to block so that's that's the other four former Blackhawks had but he was out there and making some place as well got to focus on route to for a second\nOnce again he is dominant it's looking like less and less of a fluke that he put up a goals against average in a safe percentage that depending where you looked at last season we're the best and the NHL or top three depending what timeframe you're looking at\nAnd I know a lot of people wanted to dismiss that\nWith the idea that he missed a decent amount of games last year which true he did miss a decent amount of games\nBut it is that many games I mean still played a a pretty solid amount when you start to consider most ... don't play more than sixty sixty five anyway so for all the injuries and ailments he had last year he still plays forty seven he's still put up a to point to for goes against averaging nine thirty safe percentage\nBehind a defense that let me remind you for the first half of last year was borderline non existent now they got a lot better in the second half\nBut you have to look at what Russia did last year and what he's already doing again this year and the fact that the coyotes came into this game tonight giving up to point two goals per game which was for the best in the NHL\nAnd you have to realize this is a team that that is pretty strong defensively and in net Ronda was impressive again tonight the coyotes put up goals for the first time the season really I mean they had the two and then the shootout game winner against the Anaheim\nAnd then they had the goal in the loss against Minnesota on Tuesday but it's not easy to go in to Chicago and when I mean how many years have we watched coyote struggle against the Blackhawks home or away but especially to go into Chicago put up for hold them to one I mean Chicago gives up goals\nThey were thirty is out of thirty one teams in the league in terms of giving up goals prior to tonight\nBut they just got Korea Crawford back who is lights out when he's in he's in places last December and they score a ton of goals they did not tonight they were held the one the coyotes get the win an impressive effort across the board all the way to direct talk it in his coaching staff are keeping this seem\nFocused without panicking and like I said go tending defense I mean those are the strength of this team nice to see the off and get going tonight though Clinton Keller golden assist ... Rosa two goals against his former team\nThe plate is set up the last and crowds school that was the coyotes first five on five goal of the season and the first period tonight\nIt's a nice feed from Clinton Keller it's an outstanding breakout play by Jordan ... to get the puck up the ice basically from his own goal line all the way to Keller\nKeller just got to make a pass to a wide open grouse which he does I mean that's that got to give them credit for that and crowds one times it in but that play really starts at your nose truly just a good all around effort by the coyotes who by the way\nMight get Alex couch young young back on this road trip they'll play Winnipeg\nBut all round effort by the coyotes who by the way\nMight get Alex couch you on your back on this road trip they'll play Winnipeg in Winnipeg on Saturday and then they will be in Columbus on Tuesday ... with them on the trip and I got a Russian back at this point\nBut it sounds like you know just just trying to get him tuned up now 'cause he hasn't played a regular season game and really didn't play much in the pre season you get him back he's going to come in and and put in forty goals or anything\nBut he opens up the power play and he can do a lot of damage just in terms of of being a pure gold scores so all of a sudden in the span of about twenty four hours things looking up considerably for the coyotes and certainly helps to win for one over Chicago in Chicago will come back and get you highlight next\n... yeah rating around with your favorite blanketed pillow your cat an excellent legit and your mom's chicken soup I think maybe how we know the only thing worse than being in pain and being stuck in in the hour waiting room we offer in quicker and you get an estimated ER rival time online so you can start your weight at home it's just another way of putting leading edge medicine with an easy region\nLearn more and dignity health dot org slash emergency care\nDignity health including the justice justice Westgate Arizona General Hospital emergency rooms hello human kind of\nHear hockey is more than ... the way we play whenever and wherever we plan in the street or in the ... the passion we have more in the way we all come together and why there's never any question as to what we're made out because the coyote and I saw\nThe one of the ...

because at the end of the stories as a nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you do know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners with somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his half or you don't pay your for camp by your half is uh when I was a precursor to the ending of a friendship and a foreclosure\nShown no I wouldn't do either one of those\nAnd that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small we started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down in the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWell you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it\nAnd it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt to buy a subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up I'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why\nI I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do Mm\nWell I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance company is correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through me and my last year of school I\nGot very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid everyone wants to have experience and I don't have the experience and I I graduated\nEarly so I did I did summer classes and they can't do internships is on the hospitals\nSo kind on what kind of went into a job or you tried into\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been\nEven doing accounting accounts payable any mhm receivables\nEntry level stuff mhm oh you do is get your foot in the door\nI'm OK well\nHere's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman I'll tell you this as well go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless um I'll give you an example uh we have\nEight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year\nWe had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those hundred hires you get lost in that\nRiver and there's not that I don't want to answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people it's just a logistically not reasonable\nAnd so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stack of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just because I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are ever ... but we would give him an interview\nAnd pull their pull their resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places you're trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married a kid plays soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that'll put in a little bit of a word for you\nTo at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired at almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you can get on with something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview and learn about and that would be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them and you know what might be a very short conversation though\nWe don't guarantee anybody a higher but\nWe will at least talk to them and you know what might be a very short conversation though you don't qualify and citizen or looking for but at least we'll talk to them and give the resume out of the file [noise]\nIf somebody knows them so go download that and literally comes home and show he'll help you with all this stuff is very very difficult out there but I think you can leave some\n[noise]\n\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy and like you ... when getting your mortgage\nBut this is an amazing story very well done thank you very well done well you did exactly\nWhat I Try to get doctors to most docks come out and go\nFinally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole body can life mhm I deserve a new house or a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and I it's crazy and it's all you do would you you just kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years that because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought yeah\n'cause now I mean you make three hundred four hundred and five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably weapons so you said your how thirty thirty one thirty one wow\nWas this fabulous income congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you had to have good tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader or\nI Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they I talk a lot of them are encouraging me to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from\nBeing completely crushed by student loan debt to completely owning it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have\nAn other planets I figured I'm just going to go with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYeah you paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years ... ... you were on which is pretty incredible but you're making four Fifteen minus taxes which takes a big chunk of it so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now uh you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging\nAnd just completely lean to show as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing\nWhen you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty month only given month at what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this is actually going to work how far in more you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flip for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total twenty different student loans and so I was able to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that and then I started to have\nSome more hope that I Would be able to pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I had just looked at it and I was like there was no way like there's I'm not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking them off the little baby ones when you first started yeah\nAnd that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you then have to do what he was supposed to do it lets you know that this was going to work mhm wow wow wow wow wow wow All right so what is the big takeaway when someone says\nOh I'm I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is\nJust to stop running from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get to that and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd realized that I'm the one who signed the papers for the loans you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less sugar than what mine is but I learned most people's\n[laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that for my parents and\nWhat mine is but I learned most people's [laughter] yeah\nI definitely learned how to live on a budget that for my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past and they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit cards um you know make sport for purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know there was a there was a central character that came from them that the culture but it will do this is what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good well I'm proud of you know they are well done very well done what a great great story we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story\nAnd we want you to go and be a millionaire you'll be about twenty minutes and

taking my call sure what's up [noise] um\nI'm calling because my husband and I just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball we have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans\nAnd um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings and my question is um we have a baby coming\nAnd yeah I was ready to a um April nineteenth of the duty great\nYeah excited so with that I was initially going to use you know get the thousand dollar emergency fund and he was forty six hundred to pay off bills yeah but now with\nThe baby I didn't ... that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push paws on your total moneymaker over okay and pile up cash as big pile as you can file between now and the term by becomes\nOkay and um and then whatever your piled up and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine and I ... was that event is than behind us in any worries or fruit or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but why you know eight eight years yeah there's you know but I basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any corruption when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand broker\nSocially you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then got into it and twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total moneymaker over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it up to a certain ... you will of lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nHave a lot of stuff because this is art ...\nAround okay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child ... you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and they gave me the boy because I have a lot of girls close yeah\n\nThe day room she\nWas always a AAA eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you\nI'm good how are you have better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nOkay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we park is our life insurance only got part permanent part term and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nAnd often turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and said we immediately wanted to get rid of the term or sorry the permanent and just have term\nAnd he said Dave Ramsey is talking about whole law permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you do is it failed bad shall we still didn't get the term\nI don't know why he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] because they Ramsey does not ever invest real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to huge life insurance and investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would say you need a new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you\nHave a life insurance salesman\nOkay they're showing you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is put to four hundred thousand just the term H. and then that money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which are a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said\nYeah he just language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's are ignorant\nRight [laughter]\nHe's a family friend isn't T I'm actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number ... than for as well yeah yeah\nOkay so I don't know which is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said you know Twenty years Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy with until we were eighty with hand\n[laughter] okay\nWhy don't you jump on land or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything you soldier\nOkay [laughter] okay\nAnd you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like well Oregon that do 'em in the end of this week\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who show investment based or whole life or\nPermanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and the show they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap crap in a bag that's what it is\nYou know or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to forty years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what they've Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is all I have owned myself\nI have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life\nOr investment based life insurance of any kind ever not did get a\nHorrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr their car insurance for homeowners insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind letter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that show that while there's always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason he done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name to a list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple and takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again\nYet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your\nCorner homeowner's insurance you can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major part\nInstead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent consult for one company like a state for major or a nationwide and ages\nPoor Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide in it but um and they're both good guys I like both of them something to do with that but you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurers it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time he checked on your financial plan you heard me or do you even have one I\nWhen the world is falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere because I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on them\nHome with a mortgage so we just we quit\nBorrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms and in downtime\n... enjoy to not have a ... named country wide on my back\nBank of America on my back can't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just oh I think I Would probably have an anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I'm hoping to get me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off yeah the way to go\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to sell off some investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that\nOh the people's money as your low interest\nThat's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great fun you know have a good problem I have is we're able to sell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollars that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few that about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing the amount of money and the market and I'm five foot palms we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental property\nYou know outright mhm and ah and do that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I wanted to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think it's excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yup it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter in a house they go out and you [laughter]\nSo there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national fact I've got a bunch of it I'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return\nBut it requires management by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the interim right of return the IRR okay which\nYou would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples\nHigher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten okay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total what the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the road to ... on the other maybe double what I'm then I'm making a mutual fund\nBut I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean it is um you know even though I don't manage around them a son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally deal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but\nI don't put up I don't personally deal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see

downtown la where more people are apt to be to make more noise to make more confusion if you're out in the middle of nowhere and trust me I've been to make\nWe're more people are apt to be to make more noise to make more confusion if you're out in the middle of nowhere and trust me I've been to make the gateway airport it's a lovely airport but it's out in the middle it's on the outer fringes of Mesa right\nIf there's ... ... you know if you don't have that stage\nMaybe the protesters don't come because they're not going to get the reaction like they did last ... last August well\nWhat Trump was doing rallies right around the time\nWhere he was in Phoenix there was some unrest in other cities you know Trump right whether it was inside the venue or outside and nothing really bad and I don't consider Phoenix what happened there really bad to the police put a ... they took care of business and stopped at all and make sure that that everything was okay\nNow you're a year or two years later I mean you're you're okay ... yeah I mean he's a few years into his presidency and he's doing these rallies all over America and I'm not hearing of any unrest none\nHe's still none but I
