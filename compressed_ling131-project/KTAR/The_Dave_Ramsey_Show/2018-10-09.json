often fall last year Akron, Ohio failed to rename Columbus Day after two previous failed attempt Cincinnati renamed Columbus Day indigenous people say\nYes because Columbus was a bad do you mean that's that's the essential\nSide of the Columbus as far as people are concerned politically is a it's a horrible human being because he came here and he killed untold millions and he brought disease and all of these things with him and he's just an evil person and it it it's ... it's very interesting the way that people\n\nCome at this\nBecause we take our modern sensibility right so we have all we're ... we're such a vote society seal woke we are with everything\nEquality all of this stuff the way it is it the quality of outcomes where we're headed everybody's getting stuff everybody's great if you if you believe in this then you're a great person if you believe on the side just some sort of phobic\nWhich I never really understood I got a huge argument somebody over the weekend when people are saying you're trans phobic and homophobic and I'm like I'm not scared of any of those people why would you say that I think you're getting it wrong but\nIt's funny the way that we we approach this because I look at it like I can I can see compartmentalized time so I like I can look at this day and age and say\nI'm going to put this over here in this day let's let's break this down I'm looking at his\nIn his day which is not today right\nWhich is five hundred plus years ago and his day he was a bowler\nIn his day in his day he\nWas the Neil Armstrong of his day\nWe'll try to open up new trade routes do all kinds of stuff look at the way we're going to check this out like a lot of those people back in those days Magellan and and and all of these these ... it was a dangerous thing right\nSo in his day he was the mayor\nDid he understand that he was going to bring with them diseases that ... that the natives in there you know indigenous people in the areas they were at ... we're going to die for God's sakes come on now\nCome on\nWe understood that we sent our people to the moon right and and and the the first man opens this week is a perfect example of so we sent\nThem up there to the moon right we've sent you know the Russians beat us to space you know and then we were there and what is the first thing they do they they take these guys and they put 'em in areas where they can't contaminate anything 'cause the last thing they want to some sort of weird superbug we get that now they didn't have that kind of modern technology\nThey didn't they were just a little bit behind\n\nBut the the way that ... was he a bad dude at times he was but they were also we again we're coming out things like this in our modern sensibility of where we are politically correct were well we understand all of these things and ...\nAnd we look at and we say it's bad because we look at all of our ... it's not just Columbus I mean look at what they're doing in schools now when they're getting rid of people because well\nIn this day and age\nHe he was for slavery or he owned slaves or and we go back and we start picking apart things and that to me it's ridiculous it really is you have to be able to to look at this and say I can look at you in a way where I can understand that\nWhere I can understand in your day and age who you are what you were about and in that day and age in that time that you live\nThat's how things were done\nAnd I don't think you're a bad person or or anything I just think you are who you are in that day and age you don't think a\nHundred years from now people look back at us and they got stupid we are they're gonna look at computers thinking\nOh my God they had the plane computers that's what a while they didn't have special eyeballs it became computers got out of the loop\nRight how do they live of course they are\n\nAbsolutely but people can't do that nowadays they can't take a situation\nBecause the goalposts moved and politically correct we all want to be woke and we're trying to re rewrite our history in a race certain things in a race of people\nAnd the race the things they did for the world because they don't like who they were based on the time that we live now and you just can't do that right you just can't do that and if anybody should\nUnderstand that it's people like sports right like this is a perfect example of of always trying to compare sports Eris right like oh this era was so much better than this era and that era and they fight it all the time but they don't want to take away any of those errors they just want you know talk about how great that\nWe just want to race all the history could you imagine back\nToday go let's get rid of Babe Ruth altogether right baseball has\nOne of the most infamous human beings that ever played major league sports Ty Cobb wasn't racist anti Semitic awful human being\nBeat up a one armed black grounds keeper and with his wife came to help he beat her up he shot a man he was awful\nBut people can look at it and go you know what yeah okay but we're not going to get rid of all the things he did out there\nBut we want to do that and we own a race in history is where we are now we want to raise our our founding fathers ruin a race all of these things and it's funny because you know having lived in Europe and done all this stuff\nThey look at their we we we look at our history\nAnd we're ... we're ashamed and we talk about a horrible ER with all these things and in Europe when I was there they didn't do that they they touched a little bit about that but they didn't they didn't want to rewrite it now they're snowflake heat world is starting to try to do stuff like that and you're seeing a lot of that especially in in in Britain but it it's amazing because\nWe have this generation that wants to rewrite history wants to get rid of everybody and we want we we we want to look and say we were so bad here let's just a race all of this together\nLet's just do that we can't look at it as this was their time this is who they were\nWe can't do that anymore now it's just you're evil\nAnd I find that to be ridiculous I don't think Christopher Columbus was anything other than a man\nWho had some ... said give me a couple of votes will take three of those men give me some money we're going to go do this right some of you still think we're going to fall off the earth right that is just that somebody flatter there's out there they were going to fall off the earth I'm a show you guys are not going to happen\nNever understanding the ramifications long term and and so funny 'cause some people are like well look\nWhat he did if he didn't come here somebody else would have\nRight it's like it's like

I'm In my life I'm calling period or now or her small art alone when I brought her car ... I'm a guy that are on I'm completely dark right now ... ... I I decided to ...\nDon't believe he'll ... he'll turn into millionaires the original book started everybody talking about those back in the early Nineteen nineties\nWhen I wrote my first book when financial ... was a book called the millionaire next door but Dr Tom Stanley change the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know\nAbout your family a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan as a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Thompson which daughter and uh this is the first time we've ever talked on the air we talked off the air and\nShe has a new book coming out of being blown when some of her dad's original research so sure how are ya\nI'm good how are you for having me on well\nI'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah it's um it was a labor of love and hate without my father but without and river like about it\nYou know if you guys didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck or four years ago it was it now\nLooks at the dollar Fifteen that's right yeah they say that I'm thinking I remembered that about there and um\nWe had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and all of the some of the mythology litters around millionaire's\nShow up you use some of the research from your dad's in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and they put this together tell me about the background them that part of it what about this or did you do and more of it was combined with what he had done\nYet I think that's the trade had we had worked together really on the in this whole survey for the buck on you know really started back in two thousand twelve thinking about the ... anniversary of the millionaire next door like that it came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what the book should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out a survey on our sample of a ... and ... and and he was killed by by a drunk driver\nAnd and so really he wasn't able to see the data that came back and compare it to what was there and Nineteen Ninety six and and beyond I'm here that's kind of where I took up a ticket to project and and kept going with it\nSure is an industrial psychologist and president of data points without a research and technology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help and you guys have to check this out its\n... data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore show the moved out of it you guys got as you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since with your continued research\nWhat were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings where you should go out and see that one coming\nOut you know we worked a lot at um some of them escaped though in that kind of behaviors that money and make related thing and I think what what I was\nJust like any of that that are trying to do the right thing on millionaires make mistakes along the way to do or what a lot of that sort of the ... the ... the role that they make related going back to that with the rising\nAnd then I think I think the issue is that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of or rather the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of the things that are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nA key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this one of the things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you hang around with and I see on the back of your book and understanding how those around you influence your financial by ... what did you find on that\nYeah absolutely I think that again you see it very clear from the work that we've done but with a bruising and every every day so it's like I like\nThat they are um that that that social and get fat that not caring about what other than driving and buying and wearing it they're really key factor in building well you know it's related to that were regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know our technology it really hard to ignore what other people are doing research for media and so forth but it can be they're just not hearing about what other people is unreal that it is wide awake\nIs one of the way while\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits of going broke what God did in my twenties were violently was on ... ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do with survive\nAnd thrive in an original point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think that was a big contributor\nTo me uh personally you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people as when you don't care what other people think about what your drive where you live what closure where whether you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like that like you said I think that that I'm ... now that is a lot different right and what's really going on and I live here I think it's keep in mind that we definitely see that and the research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composure to invest in ... well that is a great work come closer to grow wealth what do you mean by that\n[noise] that you know when we study that related to making depending on the couch find math but it really you know you could apply any kind of major financial decision they are making a few have kind of comment before making a decision though and you know the example we get some kind of\nOn the deck and it rained a lot of great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not if you're in an emotional state where you are guided about an income level that you have all the time you're making is that it can stay on income or as\nA matter what his financial the bar then you get out of there and making the right button\nAnd I I often hear ah we've got a rubber inch personality does a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this I'm a stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data\nThe idea that a lifestyle related freedom\nDoes not equate to less income or less welded actually which to greater and greater will the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that against your passion or or your interests let's say for your career Hackney ground and I'm kind of reality and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is trailing though um if you had an accident or the art and that's really where you like your career to go um you know you take that with the reality I mean certain things are going to be set aside\nFor that kind of again elect a lot of I don't want to hear but um the ... ... you\nKnow there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does that accidentally they'll do it with a plan\nAt the lately yeah that that's one of the things that we can't thing over and over again and again we're talking about millionaires their on their way to be coming in there at\nThat time bent planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your life and not you know keeping your head and and um that that relate to building that can't be that\nWay in court and go do it while\nWe're talking with Dr serve Stanley fellow all of a ... in your life my idol show correctly\nAt la la la la la la la yeah it's\nLike we've got one on there and a strong mess it up there I'm so sorry for law and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic work called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if you add in church and you need to ... new book that she did combined with her ...\nResearch project that they were

deserve what's up so\nI the last week I've completed my debt free during it by over forty years paying out over eighty four thousand a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd uh well I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of save and go about it because I've been thinking about just talking the money but also investing to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight job right now I'm trying to make sure you're going to save\nWell as of right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred so out of my salary try to say about twenty two twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nOkay a month correct for how long\nWell the ... at the house of looking at like a twenty percent on a down payment hundred and fifty probably about at least ten months bare minimum that play around fifty percent but I did hear should be able to get that it can include bonuses impacts your turn them such\nOkay well twelve months will be thirty thousand box\nAnd if you invested started thousand dollars which you don't have today but if he were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars\nCorrect okay I'm now we don't have ... thirty thousand dollars so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested\nAnd so if you make ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars [noise] okay and so if you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on a house or you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put down on a house doesn't matter much\nVolunteer at the point as the as years saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\n\nDuring this year Jordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen hundred Jordan is the

eighty thousand dollars in debt you can never do that again I don't plan to\nYou can never do anything like that again you're not going on vacation you're not buying a house you are a broke doctor\nHere's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clear this debt up and treat it like it's cancer and we're going to hit it with chemo and everything we got\nAnd show that I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do is I woke up and your shoes I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less which would make me debt free in under three years\nOkay and then I Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for greater outcome we know that because you've gone to school your whole freaking life and you're very smart academically\nOr you wouldn't be where you are okay you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do it the other way but I'll tell you that\nYour colleagues are walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school debt for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease the only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor what goes on my broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going fifty thousand dollar vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess because if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt urine it'd be so wealthy it's going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just ... around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is whether it's in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nI have taken my shirt what's up I'm at this point where I could be getting um\nGet in and you get like now ladder and my mom has been ... and I lived there at the fall of and if she is very very small ram and have a large one and I was wondering what that it can get in\nTo help get her ... her semi path that ran and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue must have been giving 'em would it be typing no but it would be giving yes um I don't ...

much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income about Ninety thousand cool you're single single and what are you talking about spending\nIt will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nOkay for twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any that you can keep investing show you retire with dignity and you can take care of\nYourself when you're in the exact same situation later right that's what I Want to keep you want to keep your where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom sure\nNo problem with that OK absolutely what do they\nWant to be the right thing in the end it like you said about giving the fact that funding and make sure I live right hang found\nI think you are just wonderful gift and uh your your time to her and you know what a wonderful\nYou know act of love torture mama and and and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm\nTo yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live and the gills like no one else was very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI'm well how can I help I was\nCurious why you advocate a money market accounts like low yield accounts for like mercury on\nBecause you're emergency fund is not an investment it's insurance\nOkay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid\nBecause if you're transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it\nThe right of return is irrelevant it's insurance it protects the things that does make you money to see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to shut up it's something where they get penalized if it comes out it's not liquid\nAnd then they they have an emergency you know what they do they borrow in their four one K. long\nLike a four one K. lowering the bar all goes for for a winter they cashed out worse yet and they create a mess because they got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was like what they got stuck because there were all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt creating it I get insurance insurance is ... is an expense money\nTied up at one percent you would agree is an expense 'cause it sucks it's a horrible right of return it could be invested in making more but in that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier between you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and this is insurance so good question though that that's the whole reasoning behind that thanks for calling him open phones at triple eight\nEight to five five two to five yeah when you have fun you know why

started on the final day the mountain of stroke that the mountains officially over like on Sunday and that very day everything started happening\nUm the the the journey from ... whatever you know Central American country that they came from all the way to the United states that's brutal trip and then you get here and\nYou know I I I Would hope that they're being treated well uh we've heard you know some some really terrible stories that they're not treated very well but but I I think it's interesting result when you were watching and I saw your video 'em and you weren't you are taking a video but you weren't shooting their faces\nYeah and so I'm watching this and I'm watching all these little legs get off get off the Boston and there were a couple that we're all by themselves and I'm Glad that you said that most of them in where their parents and I'm like man I don't know if I could have watched that that would have been tough for me\nYeah and it was hard to watch their faces and and see a you know the uncertainty of what's going to happen to them on a and and one of the things that the church members that I spoke with told me is that\nThey are used well they're they have experience with this so they were going to be giving a that the children teddy bears help uh you know with that and with that fear um but yeah like you said these people have gone to treacherous journey that they've gone through so many different things\nTo get here and um they're feature in the U.S remains uncertain are a lot of them are seeking asylum a lot of them are from ... in my life is what I was told\n'em ... it's uncertain what's going to happen to them\nThis I I Know that the the church is overwhelmed do they want people to help out do do they want the public assistance or no\nRight now they said that they do have all the things that they need right as okay ... yeah so they they send out a message to their church members and to different organizations that they partner with and um they said they have everything that they need as of right\nNow okay that's great because others a piano KTLA or news reporter covering the story where ice has said because of the surge people are still coming here we can't house these people so these people\nThe only thing the federal government gives them is they travel voucher and that's it they are released hopefully do a church hopefully to a center were then they can go and contact their families if they don't have families I don't know where they go\nBut they stay in America or to go through the process of asylum which means that go to court or and then they see where it goes from there but uh we you know we got a tip yesterday that this was happening because of course doesn't want to promote this\nUh but it's forty seven hundred people right now that are being released area churches in the valley in ... in Tucson and it could be more down the road so so how\nHow are you looking at this not you Mac but everybody else out there how are you looking at this as a we're all humans and we all want to be safe and we don't want to give her kids at home or you go in political on it everything is political these days everything is this going to turn into a political football how many of you out there are thinking\nWell you already is because of the president they can't be here we can't help everybody I mean how how many people were going through the process right okay but but you know I just I I I think you've got to have some sympathy for these families because I and I said it for a while\nThis is an um sneaking in the United states 'cause their economy is great and I'm going to a I'm not going to do with the right way I'm just going to sneak in and I'm going to work and I'm going to send all my money back to Mexico it's really not what's happening here we have people that are escaping um gangs and drugs and violence\nSo I Do think it's different I Know we can't you know why does the other day why does Arizona have to house seven hundred asylum seekers why why were we picked over all these other states just because we're\nWe're on the border that ... its proximity where the closest to the southern border okay and so I mean there are people that are sent to other states but Texas New Mexico California and Arizona are going to be the ones that absorb a\nMost of these ... asylum seekers\nGovernor do see on this uh yesterday with ...
