some some travel that way but they've never really gone abroad by themselves before and\nThey did all of this themselves you know they they went to the travel Web sites and they booked their flights in their hotel accommodations and research where they were going to stay and rented a car and you know it it all worked out just great for them it was this\nGreat adventure that that there are so proud of themselves for not chickening out and actually doing it\nRight but but you know it just got me thinking ten or Fifteen Years ago fill us they probably wouldn't have been able to book a trip to Iceland of all places by themselves and be able to successfully have this vacation\nOr what is it that makes the finance industry so different because you know we we do have all of these online

once I both literally and other raft uh uh actually the family members banged into right before before we went down to I literally bounced out of out of the boat into this at bat\nBut because we had some strategies that the guy had given us because it wasn't his first rodeo right now I knew how to rebalance and and get my feet stuck in there and stay in the book so it's kind of cool is one area out in back in oh man that's kind of\nWhy I advise people\nTo at least get the strategies mhm this next\nOf life was spent all of our life\nWorking all of our working is accumulating money

the SPN associates she's a recipient of the five star wealth management award and she's a chartered retirement\nPlanning counselor author of the best selling book creating calm and it's the storm and fill us we're talking a little bit today about volatility and I just wonder if those were the reactions to people of people with what's going on in the markets right now what what are you seeing what are you hearing what kind of questions are you getting\nSo it's really interesting when the market's going up it's just human nature everybody\nYou know most people have what we call market mania ... young or just this market's going\nTo continue to go up and you throw in the election where all of a sudden you know they thought Clinton was going to win yeah on if you're a little bit yeah yeah and then it went right back up and then you had the month of February where we\nAre right now we're starting to see interest rates tick up and that's affecting the bond market and and we've got volatility of course we've got the terrorists how that how is that going to play and seeing the emotional market so what's happening\nWhat people should be thinking about it and that they're starting to get concerned about you know uh what is going to happen in the market and they're asking\n[laughter] you know they're starting to get concerned\nAbout you know uh what is going to happen in the market and they're asking for forecasts and you know what I can pull up my crystal ball I can pull up [laughter] like Jack Bogle says Jack Bogle\nI mean he's a brilliant guy the vanguard right yeah and he says that he sees that he thinks\nAll over the next period of years where we're ten years into a Bull Run we're not going to see the returns that we saw before but but it's socks run at an average of about four percent and bond go about three percent we're doing okay and that's really gross but does that really\nMean that all of a sudden we couldn't have a really bad\nTariff war or oh gosh I've got ... you know\nRocket man as they say does pose a stunt than in the market so here's my stage results do\nI've been saying this for for years and years and years\nMy crystal ball broke okay but I Do know this\nDo risk in retirement what you can't afford to lose so how we're proactive versus reactive is we understand we help our clients understand first and foremost how much risk and they actually taking on their money\nHow much risk they taking that number we will show you an analytical\nMorningstar study that says if tomorrow's two thousand they your portfolio that you're sitting here right now the church folders moderately conservative or conservative or moderate whatever the title is he is in dollars and cents what\nYou would lose ... how do you feel about that\nHow do you feel about that and then we'll go into\nHow much of what you've accumulated are you going to rely on over the next five to ten years to maintain your lifestyle will show you that based upon your numbers is there a gap is that a risk that you're not willing to take so once we know that\nAnd we have ... invest accordingly ... we have low risk if we need it\nAnd the market tanks we don't like it none of us like it but yeah but it happens your bottom line is not effective\nAnd acted so we're proactive\nVersus reactive it's so important that the states and I always used this\nAnalogy couple of allergies I got Voyager [laughter] right now if your\nBoss said to you hey it's a great market I Want to take your paycheck go\nIn and buy some stocks and bonds and if the market goes up next week you get a raise and if it goes down come back next week better luck\nDo that nope I don't like that at all so we want to help people understand how much of what they've scripted\nSaved their portfolio is going to go towards their paycheck\nIn retirement to maintain their lifestyle and that money we probably don't want high risk but if you don't understand how much risk taking first of all how you're going to make that judgment and second of all if you don't understand how much of your nest egg\nYou need to make up that gap how are you going to make\nThat decision uh oh no you know whether you would risk that are not that that's really important and and there's another thing that I've said for many years\nI asked retirees are people about to retire all the time hey you know well let's just last year market yes and he went up over twenty two percent oh yeah cause I end up and up and braid yeah\nYeah so your portfolio up went up quite a bit last year did did that change your lifestyle and by and large most people who are on the verge of retirement or who are retired now so it didn't it felt great but it didn't change our lifestyle mhm so in two thousand\nEight [laughter] when it went down or if it went down like it did in two thousand they let me think how would that affect you and oh man ultimately they're concerned they're concerned so we want to help you be proactive versus reactive\nThe way to do that is to make sure first of all you actually understand and real numbers not some feeling some adjective\nYeah Dr how much risk you're taking but actual numbers how much you're taking in them back into it to understand how much of\nThat we need here and now or five years when we're going to need that money to maintain your lifestyle and then build the plan around that\nSituation well let's just picture this year you're meeting you are very good friend for lunch and you're sitting there just waiting for them\nA they're a little bit late starting to get a little bit concerned but you're looking at the menu and you're trying to figure jeez do I want the salad or do I want the sandwich cottage sheesh do I want that many ...\nYou're looking at the menu and you're trying to figure gee do I want to sell it or do I want the ... do I want that many calories\nAre not reading comes in unfortunately very panicked as to what's going on oh my gosh did you see it the market went down and ...

S. P. dot com that is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more about Phyllis and the team she's put together at the SPN associate you can also find out what they're up to keep their events posted there online as well again retire with P. S. P.\nDot com fill us we've been focusing today on volatility in the markets and just some of the things\nThat we have seen as far as an up tick in volatility tariffs imposed a lot going on and people need to be concerned about or or that people are concerned about I should say\nThat your take on this is if you have a plan if you have an effective a proper plan in place well then then you have less of a need to be concerned right\nAbsolutely one hundred percent a hundred percent [laughter] yeah yeah because you're being proactive right being react\nRight exactly so so let's talk a little bit about the strategy here for how we can get this proper plan in place because we all we all want to be that that friend who is just er that that one at the lunch table who's just worried about what they are ordering not\nWorried about checking their phone and what's going on with their accounts and and can I afford this tomorrow right\nAbsolutely absolutely and you want to know where there's much certainty as life can give you so we do the risk analysis yeah okay that's part of our retire fit analysis\nAn important part how much risk are you comfortable with how much risk are you actually taking how what do we need the money to do and how much risk should you be taking we get all that together and let's just say that risk analysis reveals that you\nNeed to reduce the risk some of the ways to do that well this is\nWhat would be cold in my industry the asset allocation realignment oh that's an awful\nAnd traditionally that's going to be your financial counselor or whatever you want to ... amongst stocks and bonds maybe some more mutual funds maybe some Morici yes more bones in stocks\nAnd I say that is not a plan I'll say it loud and clear okay to me asset allocation is what do we need the money to do do we need to be a paycheck now do we needed to be\nMoney in five years that we're going to use to buy a car do we need it to be long term money that's going to be there if we need it for health care many years from now do we need it for an emergency fund if tomorrow the air conditioner goes in in Arizona and we need to buy a new unit because we don't have time to find out if the guy was telling us we need a new unit\nIs you know is telling the truth or not we don't need a new unit right to fix it [laughter]\nTo me that's asset allocation because we're going to use different tools like\nRemember it tells you a while back that when we built our first house used a rock that hey this is my other winning by pictures well enough that's not a good tool to know banging nailed to the wall you want to use him look the same thing\nWith asset ... if you have too much risk we probably want to look\nFor different tools okay so for example if like most people if you're you got a ... law in the stock market and it's all for appreciation okay the market goes up you got a great paycheck and if the market goes down you're selling shares that you're never going to get back\nBut you really need that to be reliable income mhm if you want to stay in stocks maybe you want to be more dividend producing stocks\nYou want to something that whether the market goes up or down you're getting income from it\nMaybe you want to just be in a conservative portfolio that focuses on income that's what I'm Talking things that will generate income whether the market's up donors side with because that's what we're trying to accomplish\nThat emergency fund in today's environment I'm hard pressed to tell you that I wouldn't want to see some money\nIn a bank account or a CD book or a money market just they're safe and sound so you can write that check sometimes people use a home equity line of credit to do that this low interest rate environment\nBut the key word there is some money because there are people who you know they they are worried about volatility they use what happened in two thousand eight as a as a reason to keep their money locked up in ultra safe things ...\nLet's see ... they use what happened and she does NATO's there as a reason to keep their money locked up in ultra safe things ... savings accounts your saying some money there yeah but not all would\nPoint Jen I'm so glad you brought that up because the other side of the spectrum is having everything earning no money that yeah we call that going broke safely ... okay if\nThat's what's happening you will never get your money to catch up with inflation then that's another reason for that risk analysis even if you're all in the back let's figure out\nYou know what you need that money to do that's why you need the analysis to see do I need to position things different like we don't certainly you shouldn't risk all your money as well you should not have all your money sitting there earning at max\nTo two percent because inflation's gonna just a road that you're never going to keep up with the cost of health care very very very good point so asset allocation according to your plan plan first\nAsset allocation what tools can we use to do the job we need that\nPortion of our money to do okay and and our job is like I said if we want income in the short term is only a few tools were going to show you what those tools are will show you the pros and cons and strings attached to each one gives you a high level education on those so you can see where you're most comfortable but\nDid you hear that over Thirty Years' experience navigate inclined to do any financial climate come down with today and I think he's three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six sixty

show\nAll around troublemaker and attorney Tom Ryan welcome back\nDr my thanks for having me back well I you just hot off the presses or this or two days ago the ah\nSupreme Court ah had ruled on the invested in ad proposition that was the one that was going to provide funding for education by some alterations in the tax rates particularly if they high very high end of the income scale\nAnd they issued a very short ruling saying the way they came down which is to toss that proposition off the ballot and are they held off on issuing the full opinion that full opinion is now issued take it from the top of what happened here well\nFirst off the name of the cases malaria versus Reagan Jaime malaria is a well known um education a lobbyist a former a superintendent public construction outlook and and uh they sued Michelle Reagan but not because she did anything wrong be sued or under official capacity a secretary of state\nOr the real party and interest was the invested a education committee\nWhich was a proposition that was I was passed around and got you recall how many signatures was hundreds of thousands oh is well over\nTwo hundred thousand yeah uh the problem is for the invest in education committee had nothing to do with the amount of signatures the number they got they had plenty of signatures to get on the ballot correct\nUm ... your state legislature has done a lot to um got the Arizona constitution beers on the constitution was passed in Nineteen ten in during the progressive era one of the things that did was reserved a lot of power to the people to do something called initiative and that's where\nWe'll pass laws people pass laws and they can amend the constitution\nUm because that's a power reserved to the people are are Supreme Court has historically and traditionally said look uh just substantial compliance with all that's required were not required perfection\nThis decision imperfect substantial compliance is what I think any reasonable person say hey this is perfectly clear what it means correct well in ... there is a mistake here are mistake there it's not the eyes of all the ... and the margin ... minor technical correct stuff\nCorrect stuff that keeps your crew employed lawyers [laughter]\nUnfortunately yes but here's the here's the problem because this now fundamentally changes at sea so there are two parts when you're doing initiative\nThe top part just says hey this was a general description if you want to know the specifics it's attached to the petition\nAre traditionally in the past we said look that initial description as long as it's a hundred words or less you can't describe the whole big long and some would describe a twenty page document in a hundred words exactly and and have it be perfect or have it be a comprehensive\nBut our Supreme Court has now changed that rule it has to be perfect that's what this five to ruling\nMeans now the controversy about this is two fold the first is that this decision was rendered a more than a month ago\nA but they didn't issue the opinion until friday and the problem here is the scandal is these are supposed to be the the five to split was supposed to be kept confidential until the issuance of this opinion on friday and it got leaked to the governor's office\nThe five to split was supposed to be kept confidential until the issuance of this opinion on friday and it got leaked to the governor's office and they say no no that is a huge ...\nIs not the ... they do this we import is not supposed to\nFrom saying I Would like a lower sales tax but we need them\nMaybe we should ... nobody has ever going to say tax healthcare but you know what I get massages maybe it's it's a it's a luxury maybe I should pay a sales tax on that maybe there's some others and the effect of that\nIs to lower others sales tax if we have the most kind of fiscally stingy legislature on the face of the year you know nobody is gonna overall raised taxes overall friday\nBut to have a more rational system maybe we can lower the sales tax and have a broader base let me tell you who is in who is in favor of killing this one who's against it Steve Farley ran for governor ... governor reducing Garcia\nAmericans for prosperity that is the Koch brothers so who is against this liberals moderates and conservatives who is in favor of this they're real estate agents who are trying to preemptively\nCreate a situation where the exemption that they currently get from sales taxes might get tinkered with at some point in the future phony phony argument agreed agreed agreed\nOkay move on other one is we're short short in time here [noise] other other where you can vote on which one's worse proposition three oh six says no money for political parties they'll prevent a candidate's from giving leftover funds are buying services from political parties you know what\nNobody's against precluding that but then you read the fine print\nThe voters of Arizona passed many years ago a clean elections commission to have some public funding\nTo have regulation of campaigns by a truly independent political party here's the small print in that proposition ... independent commission right independent commission yes\nThe small print would put the so called independent or election commission under the complete and total political control of the governor in other words it is the end\nOf the independent commission it would do exactly the opposite of what the voters of Arizona intended which is there should be a commission that says free from political process as humanly they don't report\nTo the governor they don't report to any Democrat or any Republican there are commission where no party can have a majority you have to have an independent on there\nAnd uh you know equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans this is the guarding of clean elections by the way the other thing they said about not giving money to the parties at with leftovers but hey you can debate I neither here nor there on that and\nNothing go ahead they just added that the Republicans just added that now they're taking it away as a boy we're really giving you something they're the ones that added that in in ... and there's nothing that would keep the legislature from doing that in the future or keep this commission it is it is a complete destruction that question for you [laughter]\nWhat these are pretty bad this year do you want to say anything more about this ... ... yeah let me just tell you this really brief you've asked me to vote I vote on three\nOh six as the the number one bad a bad proposition because it is the biggest fraud and I'm I'm not just screaming with your your analysis on the the the one twenty six but here's the deal\nArizona's had a really good independence streak we've got the independent redistricting commission we have merit selection of judges and we have the ... elections commission all those things\nSo many of those things ... absolute national models that people on a national level who studied good government by the way every single one of those things was put in by voted the people not by the legislature because they're trying to deal with the legalized bribery and corruption that the legislature continues to pass [noise]\nThat's why we have the independent here's the thing when we pass that independent commission there was a huge huge public discussion of what what I Am scared to death about this one is that this thing will pass in people\nWhen we tested independent commission there was a huge public discussion what what I Am scared to death about this one is that this thing will pass and people who have no idea what they just passed right they're they're calling it something completely different from when it if we return thinking just a minute one of the most interesting new politicians in the state of Arizona [noise]\nI'm just going to come right out and say I love the hunting

in the schools that may not be performing well they're not going to be able to afford the private school regardless and now they're school has been further gutted of public education\nBecause the voucher money comes out of the exactly and this is\nTaxpayer money we're paying as taxpayers for families to send their kids to private school now look if you want to send your child to a private parochial school more power to you but that should not be paid for by the taxpayers\nAnd we have to invest our public schools that's where the vast majority of our children go to school that is that the hub of great innovative teaching a skills and resources let's make that the school in the community that every kid wants to go to\nOkay gotta move on I I Want to get to the subject of of medicine and health care\nAnd apologize for this one but I've got to ask the question because it seems to be addressing argue a real doctor I Am\nPeriod wealth of this week a slew of here I got John Ryan in here with me and he sent me the Web page and and I will tell you what a what I found a ... with the board of medical examiners are you are a MD because I Know sometimes there's that well it ... or something like whatever you're an MD\nAnd you interned at the University of Michigan I did my residency at the University of Michigan is a distinction right I I stand corrected but my point is\nAre some knowledge or the hierarchy of educational institutions in the University of Michigan is the uh one of the premier institutions in the country am I talking to a Wolverine uh I did a post doc\nWill go but the but the absolutely a earrings look I I I also I did for it I looked on the other day we left go has a BA from the University of from a university\nOf Wisconsin Madison mhm a highly reputable institution not quite at the level of Michigan but close if you have a if you're with a big employer that has a group policy kind of get paid for but if it's expensive it's costing you more than you think 'cause it should and your employers paying for that but that's money you probably would have gotten salary\nBut the folks who don't have that who have pre existing conditions and don't have a big group health care plan\nHow to dig it covered because they are real expensive ...\nRight right so and I appreciate your bringing us up because this is definitely one of the main reasons I decided to run is because of health care\nAnd as a physician as a licensed physician or in the state of Arizona a look I'm I understand health care policy very well and and having worked in the emergency department that was the final common pathway that's where people came when they did not have access to health care\nAnd the thing is we've been paying for that medical care all along because those people came they could not pay because they didn't have insurance that costs go somewhere eventually gets absorbed by the insurance companies and our premiums go up to pay for it so it's very important that we have the individual mandate in place\nTo keep health care costs down because we have to have healthy young folks in the risk pool along with the older folks who use more resources now it's\nAn insurance plan of produce well yeah absolutely the bug of the ... word there is mandate Americans don't like mandates for anything\nWhat is that in why is it important\nWell like I said it really it it evens out our risk pool and frankly it's an ... so it makes cos it brings costs down because it allows you to manage having folks that are on the ... end of the spectrum but more importantly\nLet's talk about some personal responsibility if you don't have insurance you're still going to get the care when you need it but somebody else is going to pay for it\nSo I Believe that everybody should have skin in the game everybody should have their insurance otherwise it it just doesn't work\nIt it's somebody else is going to pay for it so I Believe that everybody should have skin in the game everybody should have their insurance otherwise\nIt it just doesn't work that's just I mean look we have insurance for our cars right to protect ourselves and the person that we may have a collision with\nYou have to have health insurance because ultimately somebody else is going to pay for your care\nI'm so on top of it though as far as we're talking about pre existing conditions look almost two point eight million Arizona's have pre existing conditions and a million of those are folks that are under the age of Eighteen children and then people approaching retirement fifty five to sixty four who are not yet on Medicare\nThey are relying on not being penalize for their preexisting conditions\nAnd it is it it is unbelievable that in the last few days that our current administration has offered to basically allow\nA company has to go the protections and put out these short term junk plans because what that does that essentially by for case our entire insurance system it gives one pathway to the younger healthier people they end up getting these junk plans which really don't cover them for regular things and it puts pocket money in the pockets of the insurance companies in the meantime the rest of us\nAnd I have a pre existing condition I really honestly don't know a lot of people who don't or whose families don't have somebody in their\nFuneral her for somebody in there is over fifty is all ... and like I said there's a lot of kids a lot of trial do you convince the younger people\nAnd they see this policy for a hundred bucks a month or something like that and they think they're buying real coverage and they think they can't afford the one that's a little more because they think they can't but they don't find out that it doesn't cover anything until they get sick and then it's like how how do you how do you convince well I mean education\nYou have to educate them and look it's a they have to kind of sometimes catastrophic coverage but they don't have coverage for preventative measures they can't go on for a regular well check they can't go in for you know routine vaccinations\nI mean our goal should be to keep people healthy rather than just jump in once they're very sick so that's why it's really important to have comprehensive coverage\nAnd and actually have this essential health health care benefits that are fully covered and you're in\nCharge of you know more than thirty seconds to conclude hurdle to interpret any candidate for Congress look I Am\nSo proud to have a chance to represent the eight

hearing her say divorced turns on marriage into a business transaction\nAnd the show it it comes is it real quickly the emotions are carved dolphins shut over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side and it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense\nYes it did show a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans that are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or somebody else but your student loans are going to go with you [noise] um and you're gonna have to pay them so what is your personal income\nAt it they took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything he can to save a twenty two year investment uh in with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year\nAnd you'd you'd look at treated and loans how much they're going to have you got\nA better Kim I'm Sorry it's sixty thousand oh my lord okay [noise]\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship to furrow until you get past ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth a two hundred thousand what's vote on it a hundred Seventy thousand\nOkay so no equity either the amount to anything or is your carpet for yeah is she has corporate for no okay is your name on that loan\nYeah good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd they're the one that I care to let him I'm Sorry\nYou were let him you know better than that I tried to close that account today just completely closed the credit card if he has the\nOh better than that close that account today\nJust completely closed the credit card\nIf he has the number he can use it\nIf he's one of the users on the car [laughter] Mariette and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house\nI have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes Mexico drip and puts it on the guard and you don't want to pay for a five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance\nYeah good close okay do does your checking account have both names on it\nYeah okay so your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah\nOkay I didn't accept your mortgage probably as both are names on it okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep this house\nYou can't stay there yeah um so the house that needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold you cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce they often do that\nBut just you know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car your checking account or already suffered there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm it does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case\n[noise] I'm not big now how much am I have I have a ten thousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as what it says income [noise] ah it's around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and

not going to Mexico you got a message on your hands\n[laughter] okay no I'm not\nSo um unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest department you can get you gotta stay dead free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize the\nAfter the separation which will lead

corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you

I mean there's stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nOne way and I mean sweet but dumb or who you know right yeah I think so but\nI think the thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and screw it back and a little bit better you know in the two year old is are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I

will\nAnd this lack of being on the same page will so\nYou know what let's just talk this through in and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together what to do with the ringing

years ago um started doing if you think we are we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching a my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um\nThere were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ever spent ban\n'em and the question that I have and\nHe put her in any new witty about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars in the annuity um and then the other end up on the left and back then and they've been growing a little bit here and there\nUm but the question is the annuity rift recently we had a five year mark and he's advising her to pull the money I started that in which I think is a good idea however\nThe question is is that she should have should have had that money invested initially at the beginning of the uh\nTime you know and then up putting putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but she doesn't need the the draw on the humidity at all you know and he knew that at the beginning of the time\nYeah you're right that makes me question other things that are going on that I don't know what they are if I'm you\nUm but I I I and I am I personally would\nHave put all of it into good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent cars are paid off she has the wrote that\nHe wrote good good okay and how much is investments total this three hundred plus I'm\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a total with all the embarrassment to the house another fifty to fix the you know under the under their\nOld is she\nYeah another fifty to sixty yeah how are they are under their\nOld is she ah she just turned sixty okay cool 'cause she goes you know like an old on her way out right out\nGood I'm feeling better fifty seven to who say that\nSo I'm a I'm not on my way out that I either a anyway [laughter] or at least a dumb out to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um it's not it's not like you\nPut her in Hawaii policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean that just the annuity is is you know you got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity in the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nUh they're okay but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that are like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her ... if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd I'm like you guys are are desert question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if you can bows up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move and it anyway\nSo you do that with any financial people or people that are advise you um technical\nMatters when they start getting like ... like you have to owe them an explanation instead of us versus them move on to insurance lady gets an attitude it's time to move on your state plan or is too smart to sit down and explain something to you\nThen it's time to move on and so you know you're just you

so we can look at this a couple of different ways what exactly are they going to do down there because the border patrol\nThey're in charge they also have the assistance of the national guard now the border patrol has the assistance of the United states military\nOr is it all for show\nProbably but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing if there is a big caravan that's coming towards the United states and obviously you're going to hit our border of yeah there might\nThey probably need extra hand right now he's in years but there is a distinction\nThe national guard troops will help the border patrol agents who people are are trying to sneak across the border\nSupposedly these troops will be going to the ports of entry and basically built tense provide medical support helping staff command and control centers so there there are two distinction the national guard is helping people\nLet's just say in the desert where there isn't a Ford adventurous these troops or the Pentagon is sending will ... basically built ten cities and help with the people coming across an end once they get through\nSo Seventeen hundred members of the U.S military are being sent to

the\nDebbie Lesko race here all Tipirneni race okay basically Lesko has put these completely one hundred percent inaccurate why false ads on TV saying that ... not a real Dr ... which is in ... she got an MBA he's a doctor\nAnd there will be people who will totally blame the president for this and I don't think that's fair I think it is a ramping up\nAnd I think that like you said Obama made mistakes but he certainly didn't call for violence he didn't call for certain actions but this has been brewing in America for a very long time have has been in America for a very long time\nAnd it's unfortunately something that we can't seem to get rid of or get over right but this president is the first president in my lifetime and I go back I can remember Nixon as a kid\nI don't know of another president who exploited\nAnger hatred this president and you actually you tapped into it I think early on in twenty six games or twenty Fifteen whenever there started ramping up that this guy knows how to tap in and say stuff that people are like\nYeah yeah that yeah\nThat's what we need that's the guy I Want to vote for that's the guy that's going to drain the swamp but notice he says things that are absolutely in in in many people's estimation just ... you know incredibly stupid or callous or hurtful or hateful\nAnd he doesn't take ownership of it right he doesn't blame himself he blames everybody else any exploits it and when he exploits it he embolden because it has become now if you are against this president and you like Trump\nIf you say anything against him well well well well then you hate America has gotten down gotten down to that profoundly stupid logic of\nHe's going to make America great again well I have no no no no no you must hate the president\nSo your ... there's this huge divide and he exploits it every day look at what happened under Obama we had a school shooting and we came on the on the show\nI don't even know how many times how many times and the president has got to the point where he looked tired he looked ticked off and Obama kept saying I Can't keep standing up here right mass shootings didn't look look what happened in Charlottesville under Obama would come out and say this is wrong this is hurtful just is tearing America apart\nTrump comes out during Charlottesville and blows it yeah and then tries to not even walk it back but basically say no I'm not stupid you're stupid you don't understand me he exploits people's ignorance and he exploits people's\nI guess you know prejudices and and racism to the point where he says what's good for me is good for me and I don't care about anybody else and that is dangerous but I cannot say that he started at all does that make so I I\nThink it makes sense I think there are a lot of people who would like to just blame Trump for everything bad that and that and the Indians\nOr did it all does that make sale I I think it makes sense I think there are a lot of people who would like to just blame Trump for everything bad that ... it's easy because he's the he's got the biggest mouth he's got the biggest podium he is a lightning rod uh and when he talks a everybody knows what he says by the end of the day right okay so\nYou see partly to blame here yeah I'm sure there's a part to blame certainly hasn't that how he how we speak just settled people down now to get people let's talk about studies now to unite are okay we know that he this is not in his DNA he\nDoesn't want to unite the country he has absolutely no NO PLAN to do so like you know after\nLet's see after the after the male bomber\nYou know he said hey we've got to come together as America right well we know that's a bunch of BS and so what do you even if you're a Trump supporter you know that's not true a he said it because he he he's the president probably someone told them he had to say if he probably agreed he went out and said the right thing but we know he does it mean it\nUm but it doesn't mean I'll give another example a lot of people want it to blame this uh this this uh the male bomber on Trump well he had all those Trump stickers well he was at a Trump rally it was at a Trump rally loves the president\nOkay but look at his rap sheet goes way back\nI mean this guy was going to bomb something in two thousand two okay he's been in jail before and so so people did Trump pushed him over the edge I don't know\nI don't know maybe maybe not but this was a bad guy years ago right okay so so I'm not excusing what the president has said over the many years\nSome of it has been very hateful I get it I get it but I think a really bad argument is when you look at what happened with this this bomber last week when you look at what happened in Pittsburgh you can't just say everything that happens in America that's bad it's because of Trump and I'll go back to one other thing\nHow many school shootings did we have under Rocco bomb oh my goodness it was almost every you know there was ridiculous yeah now is that the president's supposed at President Obama's fault\nHey listen these guys in DC they've never gotten anything done about there's nothing really will be done about this but it just don't like the argument that Trump is to blame for everything it's way too easy it's way too easy so we were thinking about this before the show\nUm Trump\nI'm sure feels that people are blaming him for what's happened and he feeds off of that too he does\nAnd he's come out and said no no it's not me\nTrump is blamed the bomb plot and the Pittsburgh shooting on the media Mm okay so

like a tennis match they are just continuing to hit the ball over the net right and they're trying to slam it on each other so does the media have a part to play in the Pittsburgh shooting or the bomb plot if the answer is yes it's just as much as Trump\nBecause Trump to so many things wrong with his rhetoric the media does so much wrong with their rhetoric and it's this is this tug of war between the two of them\nAnd people who are French and they do this and they identify or linked I shouldn't say link but they feel emboldened\nAnd we saw that during the election one of the things that that ... that shocked me was that Donald Trump was gaining traction was getting people and the people that you thought I\nWow I I remember my grandparents talking about people like that women they're still around in America these fringe elements have come forward and like in Charlottesville and feeling bold in and they identify with Trump in some way or form or fashion but I don't think the president's doing it on on purpose he\nLikes who he likes when he likes it\nAnd he says what he wants he wants to do and we've seen anything you've got the attention of a goldfish and doesn't have a lot of self awareness you made a point in the in the meeting earlier before Trump doesn't hide behind his press secretary all presidents have always hid behind the press writer it's this guy is he's really he's really is on press secretary rice his mouth gets him in trouble there's no doubt but\nWhen he says today well the media has as has to blame too he's right he's right it is part the media it is part Trump it is but\nBut you cannot say a plus be equal no media has forced people know to shoot up a synagogue I you know what I mean I Know that's just crazy I think in terms\nOf of how America feels about itself right now yeah when you have Trump speak and then you have the the the mainstream media they hit him back sometimes it's a total cheap shot and sometimes you just totally lies that's all part of the problem right and I look at Trump\nTotal cheap shot and sometimes you just totally lies that's all part of the problem right and I look at Trump and I look at like I'll just say like you know CNN ... they're just touch on children\nThey just act like third graders when they fight each other\nAnd and I think that what that does you get somebody as you said on the fringe that watches that from one point of view or the other point of view and it makes a man and I don't know maybe it does push somebody over the edge to go and do something right is right um but I think you know they told us that half of all parties to to blame and in how America look these days\nIf if the synagogue was shot under the Obama administration we would not be blaming the president I'm Sorry we wouldn't we shouldn't be blaming this president either\nWell in ... in Charleston South Carolina two thousand five there was a shooting only Fifteen to doesn't fit any money Fifteen year was a a shooting nine
