you know a guy who was what is he an Army Ranger shows the guy who whose who he's built up a business\nHe is he was everything that you would look when you look at a Democrat you go like that to me is when I look at when I was a Democrat that the Democratic party I used to recognize just like on the right there are some people out there that I recognize that aren't that used to be the Republican Party the extremes have the bully pulpit\nAnd the problem is as we've now gotten to the point where we no longer look at the other side is somebody I disagree with a on political things we now look you across the board is you're evil and your the enemy\nAbsolutely and the gentleman who you bring up is it is a great example of talk about this with names Joseph Kopser he's running into access\nA you know Twenty years in the army he was a ranger he then uh went to the Kennedy School at Harvard got a degree in international relations ... was a professor at West point I mean really impressive guy\nAnd one of the things that he did after that is he went and created a a clean energy company which was a huge success he now employs hundreds and hundreds of people in Texas but a really successful entrepreneur he understand small business and for instance when he talks about health care\nHe doesn't talk about it in a way that shaming people who don't have the same view of him who who you know it's not from this perspective of\nHere's this sick child and how dare you not care about them because I think people who are conservative it's not that they lack empathy for people they're just trying to figure out a system\nThat that makes sense for them and feel sustainable economically\nAnd what's so great with cops are as viewers he's like look I had after Twenty years in the army\nI had baseline health insurance for myself and that gave me the freedom to go take a leap to build this business which now created hundreds and hundreds of jobs and it's helping to drive the economy\nAnd it's a different perspective on it of trying to look at the robustness of the whole community and ways that we can have conversations about things like health care and look to different types of advantages\nOh I'm Still you know it's like it's like when I talked to my friends who are like they're the climate climate change climate change I said you know you guys will approach is wrong you come at Republicans and you called them deniers or anybody who who doesn't agree with you because the reality is while scientists out there then you can find a posing science and the fact that some of the numbers have been\nYou know ... you know just dump a little bit people get frustrated and think it's a bunch of bologna if you come at it from a hey you know what whether you believe in this science that science the reality is going to take better care of the planet plus there is some money to be made here so there's a capitalism as a part of it\nWhy not become part of a of a solution here we don't do that anymore we can't have a conversation the same thing goes with health care I Want to find a way to get I Would love to see everybody get healthcare\nCan we can we use a combination of both what are the tradeoffs is Thomas Thomas ... say it's about trade off what trade offs can we have because at this point I look at the Republicans and Democrats they'd rather have a hundred percent of nothing than fifty percent of something\n[noise] look you're preaching to the choir on death I mean especially with the environment I think the other thing that happens just to talk psychologically for a moment\nPeople have a and understandably defensive reaction when they are told that they that they are bad not that it's their views but when you switch it over to that and there's an underlying\nAnd if the Republicans and Democrats each won the lottery the other night because the other side would be getting some of it neither of them would want it and it's ... some game and the fact is it has to be trade off we can find a way both capitalistic ally\n... to help healthcare ... to to do things and and maybe if there's some government intervention governments brought in some way shape or form that we can figure out a way to protect children adults people who are vulnerable we can do that the problem is I ... both sides want it their way or no way\nAnd that to me is ridiculous I'd rather have suffered Seventy percent of something Greg than a hundred percent of nothing why is it ... that we've gotten to the point here is it is it only big money and the donors that are out there or is there other things that people are afraid of because this\nThis six percent on either side these bully pulpit screaming you know social justice warrior lunatics\nHad been able to do in many ways hijack part of the party and a lot of I think politicians are afraid of\nYeah I think that that that's not inaccurate I mean I Would say that one of the other problems that we have that we don't always look at as\n... as as clearly as this is I think social media plays a big part of it and I think whatever side of the equation that you're on\nHum what we've gotten is is a virtual arena where people spend more time socializing than in the real world and they can unlike anyone who disagrees with them and they're creating a bubble\nOf people who largely um agree with what they think hum and and basically what it becomes a sort of the virtues signaling Olympics right like the more\nVehemently you can be opposed to something that is racist the more vehemently you can

growing up I was getting savings bonds and they don't really want to do that I Would I don't know if they're thinking like a hundred dollars or you know each Earth Day and age ... and then her not sure\nOkay All right well you can open some mutual funds ... two hundred and fifty dollars others five hundred no there is a thousand minimum to get them open okay you're going to open an educational savings account in a mutual fund an E S say\nIt requires because the child is a minor that someone be in charge of that you can't be the custodian that would be you\nAnd your mom and dad can or his mom and dad can add to the child's educational savings account the only limit is you cannot put a total between all of a view of more than two thousand dollars a year into that account\nSo you can and a five twenty nine but more than that but you know we're not talking about that being a problem we're looking at the minimum and you've just got to get some money scrape together to do a lump sum to start\nThe mutual fund you know so maybe two or three people put some money to get maybe you just put it in a savings account to get up to five hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that is a lot of health and you can't just check in with your smart rest or ...\nA hundred and then you open the say\nGreat that is a lot of how much you have to check in with your smart vest or pro when they can

penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what ...\nYeah it's about fifty for a ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the\nEntire emergency fund I currently have thirty thousand among

thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that as a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt is about twenty three thousand\nOkay that would be ... that'd be three months or six months that will be fifth month\nAll right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at\nFifteen thousand and um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a citizen here I'm also not a U.S citizen I'm I work here on my now ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my friends in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just going to keep a little extra well so what happened and that's why I feel and what happens if that at that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received a new role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm okay\nThe thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency there's thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund which means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decided what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back which tells me you don't agree you know you you've got your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no don't put the money in retirement\nDon't use your emergency money to do that but if you're willing to reassess your emergency phone and say I've got this thing over funded I'm going to back it down in the twenty range then I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around ... and don't monkey with it\nIs emerging to find this is this\nEmergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies and don't monkey with it\nAs emergency fund is is\nIs foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash want and it sounds like emotionally given the unusual situation that you're in you want to keep thirty grand around\nAnd so you should keep thirty grand around if that's it don't mess with that\nBut if not if you're going to permanently lower it then you some of that money to do this\nThen hey I'm just fine with that a\nCage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage our you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you it makes me want to really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I Want to get your advice on whether you think it still possible or somebody like me to run their type of fitness that maybe you're biased on the best is nice model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that\nThat come through our training to do that is it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's a very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living and I can be done\nBut are coming straight out of school difficult to do I'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact that it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling so I'm On a home you're coaching them and this house was gonna you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house and so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission has a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd\nThere's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity that do the right thing so you might explore\nThat angle because truthfully you can make more doing that\nThen you can\nJust doing a book billing by the hour and I'm not saying making more as the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably gonna have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one reason we quit doing that as our exclusively but we did\nYou know we started doing events we start having a class where we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can

neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but thanks for coming by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go then we're going to retire from our jobs and will laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be\nA the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or own\nWe currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk about what kind of a\nYou know you need to get with insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the time they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and show\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or how I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do with let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit usually what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a infiltrate the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liabilities right with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get confidence insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords how you see what I'm saying as a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it\nOr they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to insurance broker and they shot five different companies that right airplane insurance and then they come back and tell you how that ... works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families or adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would\nThese are adults camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that righteous policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs so much of this cover company covers the same stuff accepted doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight anything of this I'm\nNo ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff's effort in ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but I hold harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps honest people honest right it's like do you know you were you were walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his on or you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the hold harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are often Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful\nThey'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that

education and the shift is basically what well let's talk about that is this shift because Donald Trump has harped on this caravan has sent National Guard troops to the border has threatened to shut down the border\nOr what's in the military to the border eight hundred members yeah or is it something else that immigration suddenly become the number one issue I think it's the governor's race that turned out to not be a race at all\nI thought that the shoe a D.C ... was just battle it out all over education [noise]\nUm and I never really happen because\nOnly one of the to the stone anything for teachers amazingly used you know a lot of people don't like the way she got to the point of giving teachers are turned and maybe not want to give him credit but right and you did it he says he doesn't care if he gets credit I don't believe that it wants credit but David Garcia I mean you think this guy would be up\nI Want to give him credit but right and he did it he says he doesn't care if he gets credit I don't believe that if he wants credit but David Garcia I mean you'd think this guy would be out there talking education education education there are no commercials about him he is nowhere to be found\nSo I'm not really surprised that thirty seven percent of likely Arizona voters see immigration twenty five percent education\nWell let's see peanut fires\nYeah yesterday on the show or so

each other and yes they did spar a they talked about class size Frank Rick one way is\nTo encourage more pure professionals in the classroom or teacher interns ... because that's that's a good setting I mean obviously for a aspiring teacher and get on the job training has the often the Democrat\nOn the root of the issue when we're talking about class size and the growing class size is is that we have a teacher shortage here in Arizona with less teachers in Arizona with over Fifteen hundred teaching bacon these that's why we have such large class sizes because we need qualified teachers and the ... came to manage that classrooms\nNobody knows who's going to win this race or it is it's it's very hyper close yeah yeah I think that both are very sharp for different reasons you know Frank ridges older coffee Hoffman as younger she got a lot of energy ... energy yeah yeah and and you know ...\nYou know it was a former congressman a former cop former law enforcement so they did so far in the show yesterday especially with school safety\nBut an unexploded device is is is actually you know obviously a much easier for investigators to deal with a and as we saw in this case\nUm you know even the most careful bomb maker and and I think your ... your description earlier is probably right on I don't think this was that the most careful and qualified bomb maker\nOr on the planet but even it it's very difficult even for a master bomb maker or to avoid leading some tell tale trace a hair fiber\nUm you know a skin fragment a fingerprint on all the various materials that go into building an explosive device or an unexploded bombs is much easier to work with for a investigators\nWere John Cone ABC News contributor former counterterrorism coordinator for the department department of homeland security\nTalking about the south Florida Man the FBI said they've arrested in connection with the mailing of Thirteen bombs Caesar saying is his name uh briefly he was living out of his man who's who's over fifty years old his parents kicked him out of the house or doesn't really seem to have income doesn't have a steady stream of income\nOr the the one thing John that really struck me is that the FBI said we're dealing these are not hopes devices these were something that could have been dangerous how does a guy living in a van\nHow does he have access to making a bomb like this how how does he get the knowledge to to actually be able to build Thirteen and maybe more the FBI directors said we're not out of the woods yet how did you get access the information to do this\nYeah I mean if you can gain access to the Internet you can gain access to instructions on how to build a\nBomb so maybe off of his smartphone\n... exactly I mean if he can ... you know if he if he's living in a if he's living in a location without necessarily you know a phone line or or Internet service you know you can walk into a lot of locations and gain access the Internet via why and you know unfortunately\nA ... is a lot of information on the Internet or that it's helpful to people who are seeking to carry out some type of an attack or whether it's building you know an explosive device or better understanding the types of tactics that have worked in the past a mask outweigh attack\nSo you will jump you said was interesting there the people who want to do this I mean this guy had signs when his truck he obviously was very very pro Trump and was very very passionate\nThis guy had signs when his truck he obviously was very very pro Trump and\nWas very very passion out I'll just use the word passionate about it through the radical through the ... well I guess yeah I Know bombs to somebody around his social media footprint was all about Trump is all about make America great again\nYou know I just because I have some stickers on my car and I like Trump I mean the FBI is not going to investigate me right he's the FBI or these is law enforcement very busy trying to figure out who people are that can be and all your uh radicalizing into sending bombs how do they keep on on how they keep on ... on top of this\nWell your question raises a number of issues and we've spoken about this in the past what we're experiencing in this country and had been for the past several years a is a dramatic increase\nIn mass casualty attacks or their acts of violence like hate crimes are or other illegal activity by individuals who um who operate alone\nOr who self enact some ideological or political cause\nWho prepare for the attack primarily by using the Internet to either um gain intelligence about the attack or gain information that inspires them or obtain materials are used in the attack\nA and conduct they conducted an act of violence or mass casualty attack without ever joining an extremist organization and just because they do it alone and it doesn't mean that they don't exhibit behaviors\nVery often these people will say things and do things whether it's on the Internet on social media or in front of other people that raises concerns the challenge share is that in our country based on our constitution you can have it extreme you can have extreme ideas extreme thoughts and expressed those thoughts um\nYou know and be protected but you can't do its conduct an act of violence in further and\nWe also can't threaten somebody with violence right you can't say I'm going to blow up the White House or you I mean you go to you know for that and that's what I wear a secret service will knock on your door saying you know who are you and what are you going to do right\nJohn cones joining CBC News contributor a former counterterrorism coordinator for the department of homeland security does the post office or you know ... do they check packages for explosives\nYeah we've seen significant improvements\nAre both within the United States Postal system and in the the you know in the ... in the activities of of companies like UPS and FedEx to ship packages private way we've seen a lot of improvement and and they are better able to detect\nDangerous items are being shipped through their system particularly if they're being shipped to the air\nBut the sad fact is is that not withstanding all of these improvements you know hundreds of millions of packages\nOr letters are delivered each and every day across the country right it's virtually impossible to screen every single one of them so you know there have been improvements but you know it's it's unrealistic to think that\nEvery single letter and every package is going to be physically screened by the post office or by private shippers one\n... one quick clarification there is there an uptick in law enforcement tracking people who are angry and might do something because of the rhetoric and the political world we live in today or law is law enforcement busier now than ever\nNow than ever they're dealing with a threat that's evolved they have to balance\nFree speech versus threatening speech or speech that's a wind up multiple indicators of a potential act of violence it's a top priority for law enforcement but there's way more we have to do to protect our communities from school shootings\nMass casualty attacks that are a mass casualty attacks oriented in such as this\nWell the good news is they've arrested someone in South Florida Caesar sing a use of sending Thirteen bombs and that could be more we don't know yet could be more bombs in in the mail to various politicians and celebrities Jon Cohen ABC News contributor former counterterrorism coordinator\nFor D. H. S.

the false dichotomy and the whole debate about K. twelve education everything gets conflated\nYeah well if you're for as heroes somehow you're against school counselors that's not the case you can be for good district schools in good charter schools you can value the education profession in parental school choice you can want counselors\nAnd school resource officers and I'm just going to say but this Hoffman's position on this arose is the exact reason why a week ago I received the endorsements of the Arizona Police Association the Arizona fraternal order of police in Maricopa County attorney bill Montgomery so often you get the last say on the resource officers were running out of time\nWell I'm not surprised that the police association would endorse him considering his background as a police officer I Am very proud to have the endorsement of all the teacher organizations as well as the Arizona Republic\nAnd most recently on very proud to have the endorsement of the newspaper and
