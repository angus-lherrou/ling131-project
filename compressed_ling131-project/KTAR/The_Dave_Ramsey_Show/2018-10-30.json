tickets\nWhere social media is going to be an ever present part of politics and shaping the world around us in ways that I don't think people understand and the ...\nYou know the Google's the Twitter the the Facebook or going to become a huge player bigger players than they already are in shaping the way we're going and I was talking to a producer Anthony earlier so you think about it I I was watching a Scott Adams\nDilbert like I just do it and he said you know that Trump in many ways maybe our last Schumann president and the sense that will have a human president but that presidents ideas may be shaped by analytics\nAnd how the social media world feels about certain things\nSo if they believe it to be good then they'll get on the path of this is the right thing to do if they believe it to be wrong than they are going to take their shoes along the way from social media and that's scary but I think that's becoming more and more true\nAbsolutely I mean the analytic just let's just say for the look let's just break things that\nSports which is right it's it's it's it is if there's anything that is a meritocracy in this world it is sports over the last Twenty years analytics have gotten into sports where\nThe Dodgers albeit lost the world series\nTheir team they kept their for best hitters on the bench\nFor several of these playoff games and throughout the year because of analytics told them to they got to the world series\nThe red Sox when they started this great run in two thousand seven and and you know reverse the personal nine yards all analytics baseball football's becoming analytics basketball's becoming analytics everything is becoming analytics why shouldn't and politics has been heading there but imagine building candidates specifically based on analytics\nAnd I think we're going to get more and more of that\nUh and I think the human side of politics is gonna is gonna be taken out and that's something that that people are going to I'm I'm telling you guys we're gonna have\nTo start understanding the way this was going and how big these companies are and when they're echo chambers of really only one belief an ideology that to me can be very scary speaking of a midterms\nSupreme Court nomination process was something that impacted my decision making big news service a lot of people that are\nThey do over the things that has to be covered wages increase along with the cost of living never seen\nThat red tide not wanna guard you don't win and ... here talking to brown and black voters are supporting\nThe President Trump's message and his agenda that's largely why I came out today if you could send a message but some of 'em [laughter] things need to change cut all the BS out of everything dream as far as I get it together\nWe are won that time and time to put our politics tied up to the plate hole up your pants and let's get to work and get the song yeah\nThat all sounds great but you know the reality is is\nThere's money in hate there's money and discord a politics the beauty of politics they never want to give up what they have which is power\nWhich is absolute power why would you\nWhen you got something now that in many ways I mean normally big business goes to court power where do they go they go to Washington DC\nThat in many ways I mean normally big business goes to court power where do they go\nThey go to Washington DC they bring their money with them and they say hey we want to court power you guys are the ... and the duchess is the royals of our time and for us to court favorite with you we must then give you stuff\nWe must we must give you a tribute\nAnd that's what they do get\nSome of that power given to them as well but now you're going to have something that is more powerful than even them which is the way to control information\n\nWhich will help them so rather than going to them they could say hey we're you know we're able to control the flow of information and that control in itself is more powerful than what you guys do 'cause we can disseminate information the way that we see fit we're thousands upon thousands hundreds of thousands of engineers that are doing these things\nSo much so that they don't even understand the analytics they're putting together this big thing this is\nSo while we as human beings maybe go and we want this one that we look at social media and the way that things go and you see what it takes and social media it doesn't take millions it takes a few to to to create such a star\nAs to force changes in companies in all kinds of things that's scary I said it last\nWeek man I continue that I've talked to several politicians who've said that they fear not their entire constituent base but a few who have power and influence inside of social media that can be held for them\nAnd many of those people that may be helping them have very little to do if anything would their constituents and the basis where they are but that fear factor is real and I think this is going to be a bigger play and then when you've got things like\nShadow banning and you've got things like you know the ... you post something on the Internet that seems to be completely you know it's an ... but they deem it to be bad and they pull you off of there and freedoms\nAnd speech oh it's going to be crazy three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three and she had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet us ... speaking of crazy Hillary Clinton\nYou want to run again now right now with the ... why well I'd like to be president okay [laughter]\nSo she wants to be president but she doesn't want to run she just wants to be\n[noise] if there's any way you could just to point me president that'd be super\nWhen we have a Democrat and the oval office in January I'm twenty Twenty one there's going to be so much work to be done I mean we have confuse everybody in the\nWorld including ourselves we confuse our friends and our enemies they have no idea what the United States stands for what we are likely to do what we think is important and so the work with the work that I feel very well prepared for having\nDone in a sad for eight years having been a diplomat or in the state department\nAnd it's just going to be a lot of heavy lifting I ain't going to have any of that less than sailing all I have no idea ... I'm not going to even think about going to get through this on November ... election\nYeah yeah she is a well she's perfect for the the whole thought process of of of analytic she's kind of a robot somebody said shed so you just think they're going to be actors I I think there'll be what they're going to be is there no longer going to have their own thoughts\nAs far as they have their ideas other views are still be human\nBut their views will be more based on what's taking place on social media and how the information's being shaped and how people feel about it\nThan the actual views they have they may believe in something and they find out that social media is telling the analytics don't jibe with what you believe in here so as we all know both sides of the aisle will pivot as they see necessary because it's more important to hang on to power than it is and everything else so the analytics will drive their viewpoints\nMore than their actual viewpoints themselves some of the viewpoint match up\nAnd be popular\nIn the social sphere but some of them may not three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and she always your Twitter you can tweet us love hearing from you ... ...\nI'm Andy Solomon worldwide stroke is the number to cause of death according to the American stroke association black people older adults people with lower levels of education and people living in the southeastern United States will have a higher stroke prevalence Dr ...

subsidizing him I'm\nOpenly I Would just rather or at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and uh we get\nSome tax benefit from the house so I assume that the hundred and thirty six dollars a month that we're losing our actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the home\nFor joining us America Marisa is with us in Lafayette, Louisiana ... how are you [noise] [noise]\nHi how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nTo crash and I said anything I graduated a year early and I stay here with my parents made because of the scholarship opportunity I Do not know how to use it for myself while the and the nursing school because nursing school effects eight tie oriented program\nOkay I shall we say oh I'm Sorry ... show you how old\nAm thanking you told me that I'm sure now and you stayed there because of a scholarship there\nTo nursing school\nCar it's a it's been eight I graduated here parents made it because the job opportunity\nOkay so the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship to to get\nAt twenty thousand every four years that it wasn't a large life\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year old program I take it out there and what does it costs\nIt costs ... nearly\nOkay of which you have five it's actually need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family what\nI'm living with frankly I bought a house out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends were roommates yeah okay and so you have rent\nAnd electricity or shear and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars a year\nThere okay\nSo when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred dollars and they are going on like and I work minimum wage and things like clean up you know how they've and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay right so let's let's kind of had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other you probably shouldn't books or some stuff too but we're pretty close their show twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that it sounds like you need a new job\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole failing family name brand clothing and and now I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo they don't need to get into that you have a job you need a job you need to show you can make more you can make 'em\nFifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing you can make good money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs uh\nOther stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage and by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here\nI'm ... I'm you are gonna be working all the time though and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever\nAnd you\nUh you can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work\nAnd how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go clash\nBut you can make it if you do that\nThing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there particularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school\nBut in your immediate area talk to the nursing school and see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nKind of an endangered servant type program if you've ever heard of those\nAnd I married a hospital that actually planning on working at ... ... they will forget all my life to get out like that in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans\nBecause I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here so I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you can control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old and it sounds to me like you're a rock star thinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter] I\nI think you don't mind working in and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars a student loan debt you don't need to\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nUm I mean nursing is just there's always a shortage\nSo you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that go talk to the hospital administrator at the local hospital just shut up an appointment with 'em and just walk in there like you own the place is a kind of a you can do that\nAnd uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the way needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nAre very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task that's in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help as your fight and through this Greg is with us in Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\n[noise] Dave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out of our portfolio and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any at all with the exception all of our house [noise] um we do at least our cars\nAnd um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good client of mine that\nI reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation [noise]\nUm for both of us here the main question that I have is we have\nUm [noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\nUm some off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing uh she has four one K. I have a four one K. actually is a pension Amish all well and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage I'm On a house by about\nTen to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund them I Will put\nAbove that towards the house until the house is paid off\nSo take your income sounds point one five\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs for one conclusion you're doing is that I'm not ready to them that\nMuch greater than that back some of the contribution\nLove all the ... and four one\nK. close to reaching you're doing is equal to that I'm afraid of them that\nMuch greater than that back some of the contribution of down a little bit\nAnd throw the balance it out or if it's not up to that let's get it up to that\nThen we should just be pushed me to run as a category growth broken income aggressive growth and international [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nI I'm going to be working on the income side of the equation and I'm probably going to go and enjoy that paid for condo\nIt's a it's kind of like saying uh on back\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back yeah the oh you is back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them will pay cash for 'cause my income is going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm I'm not going camping anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you you you know you got past that stage now\nIs that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we're calling your data set for a little less in the air now and I feel like we are on I had it had on retirement but we're\nBehind on college savings for two kids so how old are your kids you and they are twelve and ten\nOkay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement\nI'm a little over a million little your head congratulations ... so what's your household income if not only that way but yeah we we are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah yeah right [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred okay\nSo why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell let's hang or private school right now as well what are you paying for brown to how much cash how much ... than a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty when looking at you like it you don't have like two hundred me one eighty okay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can return towards casual in college too if they choose a college it's reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yeah All right so I I\nYou know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think your house to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income\nTwenty thousand out for kids to school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside and put Fifteen Percent of head shots so we're talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you say\nGrand a year per kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until I go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control and saw that five twenty nine get or the one that's more of us are pros and they'll help you do that click smart ... de Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area there people we recommend them sit down when you help me with a five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you're not working our plan at this stage\nBecause you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby steps seven to increase retirement beyond Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nFifteen Percent or two hundred thousand started ground so that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it and instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this\nAnd that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids that's playground if that's where I mean you've got is where you are so good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two

um someone that prioritizes saving\n'em and since I graduated I saved about Seventy six thousand dollars in my four oh one K. I said I'm twenty thousand dollars in cash\nAnd I just started um Iraq IRA I'm right now and they have about five thousand dollars and then you will up thank you but\nSo I just uh within the past couple of months here and listening to you I'm credit consistently and the one thing that\nI haven't heard of ties is actually I'm paying off my student loans [laughter]\nUm so and listening to you and following your baby steps I um I decided to go ahead and take that twenty thousand dollars um or Eighteen thousand dollars of it and put it towards my student loan\nUm so right now I have about Eighteen thousand dollars left and get up on 'em which I'm trying to rapidly attack\nI'm the one thing though is that um oh and then I also stopped I I was putting on twelve percent of my income and to my girl one K. and I got an ...\nI'm ... I'm the one thing though is that I started talking to my friends about what I'm doing\nAnd they are just they're like are you crazy you're a single woman how could you only have two thousand dollars is anything why are you you know trying to attack your student loans that are only federal loans that they're not proud of that\nI've even heard some of my friends say that you know if worst comes to worst you can move out of the country and not\nAnd I I think I've even heard some of my friends say back you know of course comes toward you can move out of the country and not pay a guy or are\nAre

you use the promo code Ramsey\nLines dot com Jacob visiting Washington do you recommend putting Fifteen Percent into retirement I worked for the local fire department and I have a pension plan do I need to say Fifteen Percent over and above\nThat or count that as part of it well what I tell folks\nIs that you need to put Fifteen Percent and most of the time and a pension plan you're not putting in anything\nAnd\nYou don't have any control over what happens with the pension plans you don't choose the investments you don't get to um you know if the ... municipality in your case is poorly run they could break the pension plan it's happened before\nDoesn't happen very much but um no I think\nYou need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your income away in\n... four one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines\nAnd and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that money you choose where it invest it and if somebody mishandled something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else\nThe people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm that's great I'm reason I'm calling is here's my question or my wife is sixty five I'm sixty two birds you're now into getting on the on the snowball we have a ... or ... times saved up mhm [noise]\nAnd now we're looking for a new place to live the house will you rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I bought that bad ... bad backs them up and down the stairs opinion about all the time okay um my question is\nUm do rentals around this area now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up [noise] but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase\nAnd the pay my rent right now eight Seventy five a month or my payment dropped to about six hundred thirty dollars from up mhm [noise]\nUm the other part of it is a when I retired from the post office I rolled my ah prescribe these plan into an IRA good that I can borrow enough from right now with no I already just be able to put towards ... percent or ... on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ...\n... you know just like you and you're basically um I I don't get down twenty percent no you're you're you're tired of your two broke to buy a house\nHere in Dallas okay you're in debt you get your\nAgainst your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in a house substantially\nSo we're going to move down in house substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization by out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do it I Would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency fund of three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful watch what you're doing and then make your purchase\nBut uh when you buy a house and you're broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nI mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bringing his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nThan a blessing\nSteven as in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI just wanted to know what would be a martyr to do right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yes or no hypothetically at me and my wife only had\nThat my mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward the exact thing whether it be smarter to put all of it into my rock hire a active portion I open up a rock for my in my wife's name and I flipped the five thousand five hundred and put\nTwo thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch them grow that way what's your household income\nOr a household income is fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step forward into retirement\nIs more like a ten thousand\nNo it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nAnd so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter\nUh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put three thousand in more than three thousand and another okay one in one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or or um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same\nSo it doesn't matter\nA hill I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up ... ... ... five hundred in my name and five hundred her you know the exact exactly it\nDoesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational in that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not got anything for retirement which is not true because if you've ever got divorced or died or anything else\nShe's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name okay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just want some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby steps for\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ...\nWhich may be why you don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step forward after getting out of that and after have emergency if I Do folks temporarily not to save for retirement till you clear your debts that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent away\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven or fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results or whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I are planning to buy a home next year and ... had a little trouble deciding or for agreeing on the house would not want to get up out of line and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to deal with our parents myself mhm and she wants to get moving ready house\nMhm okay\nAnd uh be your first home\nThey are sick at all we've had a house for a while ago and then we moved in with an rent printing for\nWell over a year now you know the other home that you had was it a fixer upper it was not it was ... ... ... and um so what is her fear\nOr it's just for all we have to cook it you know and it's kind of a hassle ... house mhm I didn't want anything major just you know there's some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nAh financially I'll think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay sure what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't have to do that I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent so if I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can sell it tax free\nAnyway Adam I though because ... anyway\nYou know to be a real estate I show how sex versus residents would be limited to\nOr any word on Michael because so attracts for anyway\nTall they're heroes to sell a house checks for personal residents will be limited to your ... growth on it anyway for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time\nA valid point on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument [noise]\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft victim and those who have credit or id monitoring plans\nBut are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor give more by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife have something happened to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead and take all the money you can get out\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy show\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because\nThat's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in good shape\nAnd you can probably do it this way um\nI Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal because normal just sucks okay you gotta way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life\nFor the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know how you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I've thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nDrink water and it was not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much money\nRight\nAnd you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are you\nKnow forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem I got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being in live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual funds this\nBecomes like a no brainer\nInstead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the sale the rental properties and\nYou know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what my what I'm thinking is ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking at through with you OK I'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing is and so\nI probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and\nHealth insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just do some what you're doing that and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that huh [laughter] yeah and so you know but but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of a lot of\nService to humanity left inside you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan on work\nAnd it's not 'cause I Need money I don't need the money I got money coming in my ears but uh I'm working because I have a blast\nTo find something like that and then you can work in hunt and fish and work and hunt and fish and farm and you know but but\nYou know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next year\nAnd work and hunt and fish and worked in the hunt and fish and farm and you know but but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it\nThat's what I'm saying that's a that's a do a challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there is something you could do more than hunting and fishing that\nNot that that's more by this law you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out to the stage for the encore that's what the encore career as a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nSo and and it's not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more pad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you\nThat we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing but her fresh and farm and then you say a bill that year I'm going to go to ... and that's okay but but Ninety for for the next forty years you're going to get tired of fishing [laughter]\nYou know artificial [laughter] so ... that's all I'm saying so uh I'm gonna send you a copy of a book to get on George called

I thought that come from the beginning I liked both ladies they bring something different to the table but I think the negative ads that mix Sally is put out there has turned off independents\nAnd pushed them towards set of\nIncentives going after the independent vote for sure I think I answered the question for me\nHow it is senator brewer sounds speaking\nOf polls of the likely Arizona voters while\nSpeaking of polls of the likely Arizona voters wow\nWow what senator Jan Brewer senator Jan Brewer who would you want to replace\nIn twenty twenty John McCain see Jan Brewer ... leads with forty seven\nPercent or and also in this ... woods huh former attorney general\nBasically has left the Republican Party for the Democratic party a Trump is totally turned 'em off\nHe sickened by what he says is now the new Republican Party um listen I Know both of these two extremely well\nThey are very different uh Jan Brewer is is certainly behind President Trump grant woods is is not even be certainly not not right so you've got I mean that would be that would be some election but I mean Jan Brewer has big name recognition in Arizona she comes on our show every Wednesday\nThat's not why she's got big name recognition I think she was the governor for a few years and that's probably\nWhy am I remember she stood up to Obama and waived her finger and for that a lot of Republicans a lot of conservative yeah or like yeah I Want that represented in my state in the Senate she's a topic there's no question about it but\nShe's also you know with all due respect she's a little older if John Kyl steps down who does does do you replace\nHim I don't think brewer once it but I don't think so either rent wood ducks [noise] three never three\nStory on the Arizona daily download\nDay for a local law enforcement\nYeah it was a rough day yesterday not only for deep PS protect the police\nSeventy that's the number of officer involved shootings in the valley just this I hear that statistic increasing twice yesterday with five first responders injured\nAbout that too in Tempe\nThree were GPS troopers\nI'm In a separate and they're all okay for two separate incidents incidents one was there was a shooting on the ice Seventeen the suspect is dead for three D. P. S. troopers were hurt yeah and then you go to what ten feet and what happened in Tempe two officers hospitalized the suspect is dead right\n... fabricates things all the time so us birthright citizenship he doesn't he doesn't want to have Monica Lindstrom is our guest Monica ... going well I was gonna say Monica brought up the courts yeah the Supreme Court right is is somewhat now I'm kind of in favor of President Trump\nCould a Supreme Court that that that that leans conservative monitor interpret the fourteenth amendment in a different way\nYeah I explained us over and Katie A. R. dot com the Supreme Court can interpret the laws but it cannot create and it meant to the constitution or create a part of the constitution so the executive order if they want is he actually signs that and it winds its way up to the Supreme Court\nJustices can say ah yeah the executive order is valid or they can say it's not valid but they can't change the fourteenth amendment that is\nFor Congress to do and then for the states to ratify that's a huge process that I Can't see will ever happen but considering the court is conservative and may be leaning towards Trump started here they may find that he has the the\nLegal authority because of the executive order do good unless it has the authority to do it\nThey could say well the president's in charge of immigration law forcing immigration law this is part of that and so his executive order is ballot now\nThey're the constitutional limit the constitutional issues come along with that Supreme Court could side with them I don't think it's going to happen now\nMonica Lindstrom aggregators legal experts so if what if what I'm hearing if what you're saying is this Monica\nThere's no way he can wave a magic wand and change the fourteenth amendment by himself\nBut he could get the Supreme Court to say yeah\nWe'll let you have this kind of authority but only I guess a more as long as he's president because as long as he's president he would want it but it would be overturned or changed if a ... an if another president came in so there really is no changing the constitution without Congress that's what you're saying right\nAll right yeah so this this ... this has to be like a Ninety five percent stunt\nThere's really no way that this can actually happened in the next year right right\nYeah I don't see this happening\nThe way that Trump wants that to happen I see you're starting the conversation just like he did during his campaign thought about getting rid of this I think bringing attention to it because of the illegal immigration challenges that our country is facing now this is not going to happen on his act alone is has to happen with Congress but that only Congress\nThe states have to ratify now caviar there could be something\nAnd here's an act of love it has to happen that that are like this they have to ratify now cat yet there could be something called a a constitutional convention any you know all that\nAt all those getting off the hook are hitting those constitute good adventure people dress up as justice said oh they dress or Ginsburg\nLike oh it's great awesome great yeah yeah that's not going to happen on a car has a very difficult path ... very very difficult\nMonica thanks a lot\nBy guys Monica Lewinsky dramatic and gave us legal expert\nAnd remember to a guy in it we had prohibition we outlawed alcohol right it took years\nFor them to change that that was another amendment I mean you know ... that took another number of years ... Trump's Trump's throwing this out for political purposes right and and Monica said to start the conversation you can have the conversation and we've had the conversation before\nA you know you've been in talk radio long time I've been ... I've heard this before and change the birthright part of the constitution it would take years and a number of lawsuits and ain't gonna happen\nIt'll get you tell me why you're doing it though President Trump ... what's the real reason is because you think it'll stop caravans from coming here it won't will stop people from coming over the border legally no\nUh then it will help get me on the Republicans elected well that's it's probably because of the midterms listen there are some things that I really liked the Trump does there are other things I really don't like the Trump does\nI don't love Trump I don't hate Trump but this is this is a president who would like to see everybody in this country look exactly like him okay white I don't know where the overweight\n[laughter] you know what I did yeah white fat shame them\nOr you know we we he doesn't want he doesn't ... I mean he's he's he's trying to scare people that oh well they're Middle Eastern people in the Caribbean wrong oh well no other country has this wrong not to lie to he wants to\n... he and he wants to anyone by fear anyone different coming to the to the United states that doesn't look like him he doesn't like right that's the travel ban that's the Muslim ban\nThat's what it is this isn't going to hell now the citizens this isn't going to stop illegal immigration this isn't going to stop the caravan from coming this is just one man who likes white people\nAnd if you're a white baby you could probably stay but if you're a brown baby oh goodness we got to make sure that we get rid of you know she I mean I'm Serious that's what that's what drives me crazy about this guy\nIf you're a brown baby born of immigrant parents exactly not offer\nYou know what I mean [laughter] what are you got there oh grandbaby or you know are are you get out to go bye-bye oh are you from Canada right here from I don't see the guy drives me crazy\nI don't know because he does have some good policies he does have some good thoughts but managed to get the biggest mouth and this is just a stupid move okay by the way he is in Pittsburgh I'm not a lot of people want it in there there's some protesting going on he's there for you know to try and\nWell he's visiting some of the ... and where the shooting happened and he ... I guess he's trying to be president I think a lot of resistant right right well talk about that a little\nBit but are coming up next should we changed the date of Halloween to always be on a Saturday oh please no oh [noise]\n[laughter]\nArizona voters election day twenty Arizona's Senate candidates are campaigning hard as this race is still too close to call this division to Arizona's wanting news this morning Democrats\nFrankly when they're ready for it and I\nHave\nThe welcome to make Sally in Studio tomorrow morning at seven forty eight or Ninety two we rely on McCain T.

pain you probably haven't tried I support from the good seats\nWe do that with Easter every year that's true that's true but Easter is a very different holiday there for the area and you know there is a holiday and to me how to use just as well you don't get off for ... for Easter either\nYou know what I mean if you're ever going to do this right Easter we should treat it like Christmas and Christmas Eve we get the friday off\nBefore Halloween and you get you get Halloween off well now you're for it that's the only way\nThat oh that was all in my heart is not really I now I Know it's like night on it's a night of one right but you're right I mean it would make things easier for parents it would make you know things I guess\nGo a little smoother I I don't think it's really going to work well a lot of people say because of safety uh and I mentioned you know four thousand all the way and related injuries children are more than twice as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween well I'm sure to show that are out more than twice as I like right yeah right right right right right right\nUm what do you really see this going anywhere\nI Do is I think so I don't really think that the land that the president would get involved and say I'm going to sign an executive order to change all Hallows eve to the last Saturday and any in any October\nWell he can change I mean all Hallows eve is what it is right you can say we're going to we're going to celebrate with trick or treat all around the country on the last Saturday in October so then what do we have or thirty first well we just go about our\nIs that when it's a great pumpkin Charlie Brown and all those specials are on television is that the only thing that we get on October they're worried about the rescheduled yeah you're worried about television really\nWell that's the only thing I can think that we could keep consistently because if we have Halloween Night on Saturday well what do you do with the actual thirty first you don't do anything you want to ask your business regular day no regular day\nOr could celebrating Halloween on a Saturday happen and will people do it because it is safer uh I guess it's got to go through the White House there's enough going on over there I don't think this was happening [laughter] so and and they do what is the Grinch going to do a boy\nBut it goes through the White House there's enough going on over there I don't think this was happening [laughter] so and and they do what is the Grinch going to do a boy okay\nI I just I I Know that if you sign a petition and you'll get a certain amount of signature correct they have to look at at the White House ah don't expect this to go anywhere\nDon't expect you don't think Trump will say you know what I've heard the American people I've heard the children I'll change it I don't know\nI think he's got a lot of other stuff to worry about oh he does but he also has the attention span of a goldfish I mean speaking of Trump or he visited Pittsburgh and actually use in Pittsburgh is like now I'm obviously there are the deadly shooting at the synagogue took place over the\nWeekend there are a lot of people that say why did he go well wait a second he's the president or people are saying yeah he shouldn't have gone why are people saying that will tell you next\n[laughter]\nArizona voters election
