only two who ever ever backed\nUp what I'm what I'm saying and they had big problems which is why I mean those hearings transfixed the nation it was it was very quick and at the end of the hearings a two thirds of Americans believed\nClarence Thomas but the media is set to work\nI'm over the next year or just you know we did what they're doing now just over and over again lying to the public boy talk about fake news on the greatest thing about Trump is that is driving down I mean for people like you are and and me we knew um that the media or liars long ago but I think a lot of\nNormal people with with busy lives you don't pay that much attention I'm Still thought they were getting news from the media um a year after the Clarence Thomas hearings the percentages had reverse two thirds of Americans\nUm claimed that they believed hill and not tell them so that's exactly what they're trying to do right here right now with Brett Kavanaugh um we've seen there's no evidence we've seen that it's it's stunning that that NBC NBC the network that\nSpent months investigating Juanita abroad rex rape claim against Bill Clinton refused to run the interview with her until after his impeachment trial was over to make sure I'm that ... that every Democrat would be would be fine blocking the removal of Clinton from office\nBut this woman last night this Julie sweat like the one claiming the gang rape parties that she kept going to over and over again um\nNBC has to admit she gave us four witnesses one one witness [laughter] got back to us and said\nShe's never heard of Julie sweating it before the other witness is dead the other two have not responded and yet NBC puts an interview with her on on TV and hypes it to the max\nOh absolutely and that that's the insanity they give them a platform that they wouldn't give other people who had legitimate claims along the way and\nUh but you know this is the world we live and I've always said it's the stuff you don't see that the media doesn't want you to see the more dangerous to to them and and do their side if you will\nThan the stuff you do see it and this is the sad thing and and I'm looking for like two thousand twenty people talking about you know by by by and everybody's like how by going to live down what happened with Anita Hill because that's something that is now starting to come out in a lot of people making noise about that 'cause the right if you will is using that against the entire Cavanaugh a argument\nYeah he ran the hearing properly how outrageous [laughter]\nI mean he didn't say he was I I think fair\nTo Clarence Thomas I Will give him credit for that you said before the hearings he was going to vote on purely idle logical ground it was a Republican nominee he was voting against Clarence Thomas something that Republicans might want to think about doing um but no it's it's ... Democrats of course have to\nHave to pave the way they were the first ones who can be absolutely naked\nVicious partisans once they've done it you'd think Republicans would say okay you did it to our nominees were voting against your nominees but Republicans have this idea that there are good sportsmanship\nWill be rewarded by better with better behavior by the Democrats it never ever ever works and yet they keep trying well let's try it again this time um\nBut yeah ... uh he did at least run the hearings you know honorably unfairly\nYeah well I mean that but again that now will come back and bite him because as we all know really what do you make of this retro rage I mean that's what I call the retro rage where something you do a joke today on Twitter or whatever I mean you'd like today I got a bunch of people because we put up a fake movie trailer but you cannot be the Boogie Man the people like I hate you and stuff like that\nAnd I expect that from certain people but you know you go and sweet something today and then all of a sudden six months a year from now what was funny we we we moved the goalpost and and now it's evil and bad\nI mean at one point in time just got to be like a drop dead date where that's five years you can't go back five years now we're going back twenty plus years because he had a few drinks in high school or college and he didn't saying this retro rich\nThirty five with him while I really think it's ultimately it's ... it's the substance\nIt's the substance I'm I don't care how many years ago it was um [laughter] having beat her in college this hysteria over his beer drinking is is is utter madness um they tried to as\nAlways um they take 'em a silly charge\n'em Trump used a bad word and the Access Hollywood tape and instantly that goes through this chapter two of my of my book now resistance those few tile um the hysteria over the Access Hollywood tape and how uh the left and the media ended up hurting themselves with their tight and outrage over that\nUm if you listen to what he was actually saying it was the same formulation\nAs a when he said he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and his supporters wouldn't leave him he take something that is axiom adequately unacceptable to describe the passion of a certain group of people in in the case of the Billy Bush Access Hollywood tape when he was saying is the craziness of celebrity culture\nWhen you're a celebrity they let you do it that's what he was saying and then and then so I didn't something axiom medically unacceptable using a bad word yes he used a bad word um um it ... it would have been you know sophomore embarrassing but known as the media instantly has to go to he's\nAdmitting to a sexual assault no he said they let you do it and we're seeing the same\n... dumb follow the same path right now with a beer drinking um no it it proves he lied he lied no he said\nHe drank he said he cringed over some of the things he did um he said sometimes he drank too many beers um there are now taking a college kid getting drunk and claiming that blackout drunk\nNo no I'm Sorry is not that I wouldn't care if it ever um you know ... blackout\nBlackout drunk [noise] um but you don't graduate number one in your classroom high school do so well end up at Yale and do so well at Yale that you go to Yale Law school I'm no he he's he's obviously someone who works very very hard that is not a raging alcoholic\nNo no it's not I don't and again it go and ... here that's what they're trying to come up with perjury\nIt's crazy just to hold the region for anything talking at golden resistance is\nHow the Trump heating last last collective mind and they lost more than anything uh lets flash forward a week and they get some of this stuff done that they think they're going to get done because again there's no case files or not they're not going back and taking out something DNA there's no crime scene where do you think happens from here if it is it going to satisfy Murkowski Collins\nAnd flake enough that they did they get this thing done or is this I think that the way that Trump's looking at this now we can make lemons that dilemma we can take a we'd make lemonade and lemons and make this a big push for November and maybe steal a seat or two in the sense\nI wouldn't count on it I I ... a little look if that's what it takes to and\nIf it comes to that I'll discuss it then but um it's hard to keep anger going um we have a lot of ... weeks left here and I think\nThe number of people who will be angry on our side will also be matched by the number of people who are demoralized they've got to confirm Kavanaugh um there are that pressure has got to be put on if if they're wavering\nUm and I probably shouldn't be attacking them so much on Twitter because they haven't precisely sad um but I tend to think we will get Murkowski uncalled ones I also think it's very likely we're going to get\n'em mansion and hide camp looking at the polls in their states and they're up for election and there is a lot of rage on the other side I'm On our side that is to say I'm for the first time real rage over there so don't start no I'm I'm I'm sick of Republicans saying just as a general matter\nOkay we lost this time but we're really set up well for next\nTime no I've had with next time I Want to win this time and there was no reason this man should not be confirmed this report said so I think today they come back and we need nine justices on the Supreme Court there is there is a time limit on they are there are times not a time limit but there are time demands\nThere are time constraints we need to get Kavanaugh confirmed this is nonsense is just allowing the nonsense to go on and on and on it's been what how many ... a hundred hours since since\nDr Ford's literally substance to some of them have lists\nEvidence free corroboration free allegations and an chock full of lives herself on her testimony has any additional evidence come out to support or no none none now now we're down to whether Brett Kavanaugh's ... know this is nonsense\nBureau and coal to love having you on resistance is futile how the Trump meeting left lost his mind look forward to\nMine look forward to talking to you again I appreciate that as always thanks so much\nGood to talk to you by by\nUh she she you know what you don't have to agree

[laughter] I just made you think you could\nDo it so you went and did it wow that's cool well tell me the story two and a half years ago what happened\nWell Dave about two and a half years I started listening to your show mhm I listen to their ... on the radio at home and I became very obsessed with it actually I talked to everybody I go over there I was friends relatives are giving her head yes and I I did become a little obsessive don't you think\nYeah Dave actually the term I coined at some point in this process was hunting I think you need to go to Dave Ramsey rehab\n[laughter] detox [laughter]\nAll of it was worse things to get addicted to I guess I'm a proud of that [laughter] so\nHe got a little bit overboard and Sarah is like okay just come on but ah how quickly did you get involved Sarah\nOh very early on I didn't really have a choice you your voice says on there and the math on getting ready every day so it was a you know I was in full bore and I and to death and was the driving force but it was really easy to get on\nBoard so you guys looked at it and together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the Dave Ramsey part I'm you looked at it together and said hey if we really rolled up our sleeves we could\nPay off the show that's it had an a ha moment huh\nYup and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always came to the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the world not then and the grass does feel better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also the truth yeah very cool very cool so how long have you been married\nEleven years have you ever been dead for a while you were married ...\nKnow this is it not recently no\nWere you ever go back absolutely not too good to be free and gave my favorite part of our story in our journey is\nWe have that almost Seventeen year old daughter and um the term that we've heard over and over as Mars cut and taught and just seeing how true that is with our daughter it's such an amazing thing to see and she literally is\nYou know a senior in high school and preaching your program to her peers and this is going to continue on and on and on\nWow so the family tree is changed yes settle down on just what the money part but with the lessons learned\nYeah well done you guys think what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nWell I think it's planning having a plan communicating with your spouse and being real strategic with your money when we\nWhether it's shopping for groceries would go to the discount you know grocery places ... whether it's going if we're going to go out to eat um we're looking for coupons group bonds some sort of deal when you know when we go out to eat and\nWe pretty much every time we go out to a meal we share a entree that was like no I mean every single time so things like that and I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper so all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything that's on sale\nThat's just how and I and I don't see that changing ever settle it ... if you want it to I mean you you don't have your payments\nNow and then my DNA I'd I go straight to the sale right on well\nThat Sharon she always tells me how much money she saved me which means that cost me something but yeah I feel [laughter] but nowadays we can afford it it's not a big deal\nNo one else later you can live and give like no one else and you guys are in that position so did you have people thought you were crazy a detractors or did you have a more cheerleaders\nAnd we definitely had all cheerleaders around us and no negative comments did three the whole journey and and we love seeing you know our friends are set to part of our family it's just been wonderful\nWow so there there were cheering you on route to the finish line yup very cool show them the Sacramento radio station and show you listen to his own correct six fifty yeah great station I was just with those guys the other day a great great folks\nAnd occasionally the broadcast as well and that was it that's all you that just listen to the ... and of course the book that'll be able to make as a okay and we also have a rate of ... markets all there we go okay very cool well congratulations now you've also got Chris ... book\nRetire inspired and a reminder to always be listening to his podcast returns by Bob guess that'll give you the next chapter 'cause you're gonna be multi millionaires you really are I mean you're sitting on a ton of real estate paid for this stage\nAnd no payments in the world very well done very well done\nAll right Justin and Sarah Sacramento, California area two hundred and twenty thousand dollars paid off that's their house\nAnd everything did it and two and a half years making two twenty to forty counted down let's Sarah dead three scream three two one\n[noise]\nFun stuff [noise]\nI question that comes from blondes dot com you do not need a second mortgage to make your home over you can get brand new custom lines without paying custom prices from ... dot com always put in the promo code Ramsey and you'll see the best possible deal out there\nThese guys are great company blondes dot com Shelby's in Illinois is it a good idea to pay for the coverage offered by the gas company and the phone company to cover the lines that run from my house to the street if something were to happen we are not in a financial position to cover any repairs\nUm no I Would not pay for that and I would get in a financial position to cover the repairs it's called your emergency fun so you need to work your way out of that like we teach\nAnd that's maybe step to paying off everything but the house using the debt snowball and then from\nThere once that's done once you're out of that everything but the house then we're going to build your emergency fund three to six months of expenses I Do not have any insurance on the things that run to my street on my house is not on any of them\nAnd if something breaks I Will just pay somebody to come out there and dig it up and fix it it's that simple how would I Do that well I Would use an emergency fund how did I get an emergency fund didn't give people like this money [noise]\nSo I had more money now are you taking a risk in the meantime yeah I mean you could something happen between now and the time you build it up but the point is get your financial act together and the weird thing is it causes you to end up with more money\nSo here's what's cool do you ever hear the term the rich get richer the poor get poorer well there are several reasons for that\nAnd it's not oppression and capitalism is evil that's not a rich get rich or poor get poor because by and large poor people who do rich people stuff with money become rich people overtime\nRich people who the rich people stuff with money stay rich people rich people who do poor people's stuff with money become poor people in other words it's a ... have you were saying it's a set of habits a set of values are set of choices that's part of it the other part is is\nWhen you do get your head above water and you get you know you get Murphy out in the street Sallie Mae has been evicted you have more margin in your life and the weird thing is when you have more marginal in your life you make more money let me give me an example\nWhen you have your emergency fund in place you can ... you can raise the duck doubles on\nYour insurance safely what happens to the premiums\nYou cannot pay for gotcha insurance like these little\nYou know shoreline [noise]\nChange or some such crap [laughter] it's horrible evil you know you don't put your money and stuff like that you self insured through these kinds of things in the weird thing is emergency what happening as soon as you get an emergency fun isn't that where\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nAll it takes is one emergency trip to the dentist to blow your budget quickly now I'm not a fan of dental insurance I think it's a waste of money but they're\nIt gets a waste of money but there is another option it's called one dental and it's not dental insurance one dental is a discount program it functions like a membership clubs think of it like Costco\nSo that's a big thing keeping cost down and that's what allowed you to do this what other points to you have for getting out of that [noise] well uh definitely\nYou know we live in the age of of excuses you know everybody has an excuse for something and I got a lot of [laughter] yeah I'm just you know don't make any excuses we've heard a million times you know\nOh well if we major income we could get edited or if we didn't have kids we could get edited the really anybody can do it I\nMean people do it of all all strike down here\nYou know very cool yeah that's good that's a good point no excuses just get after it you're going to you hey that's your deal so do you deal you know whatever your deal is do it that that's what was dealt with you gather excellent good job do you guys very well done well we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you as well\nRetire inspired number one bestseller and keep keep tuned in to his podcast returns burden that'll\nKeep you on the track to now becoming millionaires and outrageously generous along the way okay thank you well done YouTube\nRandy and Jennifer from Memphis one hundred and forty four thousand dollars paid off in thirty nine months that's their house or anything by me a hundred a hundred and eight thousand dollar income counted down let's hear a debt free scream three to one where\nWe\nA place where there's also the Memphis area Hi Jacob how are you and Dave I'm great how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\nI'm my fiance and I were just\nLooking for some guidance on something I'm so we don't have very much that we've got about twelve thousand two hundred on a car that's worth about nine or should she got twenty six hundred in student loan debt and then we have our house mhm\nUm we bring home between four thousand I'm forty two hundred a month um and she's looking she's not really satisfy whether job a career path and she\nFound the majority of our cars coursework to get an associate someone into the\nUm about where that would fit into step um\n'cause she makes ten Seventy two an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some benefit\nI'm ... and the programs that she's looking at\nA as a radiology attack which would take her about two years to get done and uh that's made us our ... year\nA lab technician would take about a year to get done with her current the stuff that would transpire and she'd be making thirty eight thousand after that or an HR specialist would take her about three years was shot that kind of the the last\nYou know choice of hers to get done so well you know we're not we're not that much that and I just didn't know where we should focus on first\nWas the first thing is is I hear a wide variety of jobs elections here or course yeah I mean she leaning\nTowards the rat pack as their number one it's a really good program here in the local areas are short nap\nYeah you know and I think I hear that you guys were analyzing her career only on the short term income\nI'm thinking long term she she right now she works in er HR I'm and she really enjoys that she is a\nMetal day one or more than ... years from now aside from income\nUm or type of man come she likes working with people and shoot she was really excited about the rat pack because we did a site there that are kind of a an orientation type thing and she really enjoyed the the teachers in a facility than they are they're working with people in that way so of the three I think that would be the best long term for her as I said\nTo your program did you say Oh yes sir\nAnd we're not at all it would be around Nineteen thousand but I think losing remain and work\nBut uh she would have to get for her associates as well as the actual course work for the degree\nOkay so really what we're seeing is is we need Nineteen thousand dollars over the next two years plus we need a about Fifteen thousand to be dead free over the next two years yeah so that's thirty five thousand over two years that's Seventeen five a year and you make about a little over fifty\nA yes so I'm so much you can do Seventeen five a year to me and be free and pay cash for her school in two years\nOkay I've got a cat when when you got to map out mapped the map out but um you know I may have done something wrong and I was doing the math but I don't think I did\nYeah no that sounds right um so he he plugging away at the desk ... snowball and the short term and save up to pay cash for the right type program\nWell you can you ought to be able to cash flow the ... program is what I'm saying oh oh okay you need to look at I mean I I think if she starts now and you figure out\nTodd okay I got to save this much a month to stay out of one semester ahead of my payments right or for that you got to get you got to get that part moving and then once that's moving there which are throwing money at the vet and you keep up with your monthly budget basically you save the set amount\nOf ... a month to discover the rat deck once you get started here okay and then above that you knock out your debts probably looked at as a part time income in addition to what you're doing now you're both working their butts off from a tough tough to years\nUm but I think you can do this sounds like it's casual [noise] this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get those question all the time they wouldn't it be smarter for me to sell my house myself

wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here's a traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner\nSo I'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in their off hours builds your brand build the demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justified you getting your own space beat out a duplex that you live above or your own stand on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches that will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary schools the elementary school right next door household they don't have school on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just a great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do that so\nI don't think your ideas a bad idea I Would just challenge you to start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you definitely look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment\n[noise] Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was the question I work full time and I found with Iran and um I was planning and also going back ... to share and that way um I I've been making more money but it'll help them find like business as well\nYeah I well of course you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you were trying to go right on open it right um I I just want to see you maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three mumps when I see if you can get a small group in my pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip toe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is going to lower to cash flow of more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean ... you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business or like a yoga studio\nYou have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you are and where you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside they're coming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to have a location before you can start your business because you\nAre the business so you can start tomorrow but you can out of your living room if you want to learn on the street and by the way you should go ahead totally yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the way you are the business point people don't care I Know for ... enjoy it to come in for you they're not coming for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight eight to five five two to five in common crispy rice sitting in for a range of this hour take your calls about your business your business idea a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we'll\nHead of the crust out and get a few good luck on how can we'll well\nI've been on the cheap show for about Twenty years and to this point it really hasn't ban I haven't progress as hard like where am I originally hoped and wish that was\nA long story short is I'm back in January was that I went through a pie view and as we're about to a baby steps one step too right now\nGoing through some of our stuff together perhaps they'll go on a we came in to some old home movie a fish from stuff that she got from bad um when he had died um and\nThrough all the things we found you know we have a lot of old age millimeters old VHS raw stuff and it was like okay we have all this stuff [noise]\nUm I started to averting it and I really found a passion for that that I have an ad in the first part of the aisle and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn into a great business I Love doing going forward\nA slick at this point\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy format like later VHS wide sales law that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nUm we bought a question I have is just um how to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I throw it ah properly and ... the um\n... or tell you what Bill crush the\nBill ... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we might help yeah here's the thing about the great news dance\nOr when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses that have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve on and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language that speaks to them right where they are to the best part about distill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do\nIs you're going to build your business and you're going to get better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself\nIn that market a bell I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps and we'll get we'll send that to you send it right and it's right\nIt's a great plans to follow it and and here's this thing a Christian a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting\nHe finds these old things and you realize way I don't have an office and and you are giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I Want to just had when they try it just tested on the channel that last caller here's why some passion should be ...\nTimes when you turn it into investment banks\nThat what you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it and keep paying him into other things you need is done they tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away stop thinking about it stopped getting landing just you know in the water just doing triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise]\nDon't go anyway this is\nHeard me talk about ideas for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real\nAnd meet and chose the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or those things you're running independently already or do they go through the main company that's paying your salary\nSo they're different companies OK I'm here yeah two of them are kind of action I own projects I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work four years ago that your contract work for perfect I mean they don't have that salary yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back me\nAnd you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end the tunnel when you're going to start increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand that client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting together interest\nOf other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run\nAs an independent person you're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then when you decide to leave your fulltime job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband had income\nSo you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first dear you probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nYeah and it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days maybe step stays babies to fund the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right that should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience but the lights on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels and important point can cause so many people still like how can I sustain this well you're not until January when you'd that light up in the tunnel you know this is the first season them to put my head down for a season them and had the rewards and the worst things are\nAll right let's go to write a real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\nHey how you doing guys I'm OK though I've been in the field\nFor the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the field the past six years I've been doing the security um which I Love even more\nUm I feel I feel though where I'm at I'm store to the next level to go off it would be manager\nLevel and I don't really honestly want to be a manager because I loved it so much of the technical aspects\nOf of by the security so\nI was wondering if it's possible to try to start something on the side are related to the security consulting I'm and I'm just not exactly sure how to do about that because they would mostly be shore\nBusinesses and I'm In a conflict with my current job well\nLet me ask you a question is the only reason you're considering starting the I. T. security consulting business because you want to make more money\n[noise] no not at all\nWell you ... your insecurity right now you'll love it that was your statement but you said the only way to move up was to be a new and making ... I think you feel like you're trapped so the consulting business feels like oh this is a way to allow me to see a lot or is that right\n[noise] yeah\nSense of progress you just want a sense of progress that makes sense it\nDoes but again the question here that I have is wait a second have you looked at all of your opportunities within I T security it's a big world bigger than I'm even able to understand for you to move up so where are you at now financially where would you like to be\n[noise] um well I mean\nThe most just answer worry what are you making now eighty four and what do you want to make dream a little one fifty\nOr in and so okay I just wanted a ... as we can answer that sure but but I just wonder if if it's the right time re for you to step out and start a business where you at do you have any debt what's your financial situation\nAh yes we are heavily in baby steps too\nIt'd be to do it alone that we're working on paying off or they just moved to the house\nI'm I re children my wife also works as a um actually has a good job I just look it up when you start something on the side and see if I Would like to take that over fulltime\nHey right I don't I don't think it's a bad idea to test it but here's the thing I Would encourage you said you didn't want to be a manager in your current company you start up side business they're managing something still you're managing a business and you're managing you actually try try it with one or two clients makes sure doesn't conflict or compete and then you'll get a taste of if you want to do more of that

did you see do something\nTo move the polls in a positive way for him or\nAs David Garcia failed\nTo get the word out about his policies and what he's all about we still don't know a lot of his policies that part of the problem I think we don't know where he stands on what's your plan for education what's your plan for a job he recently put out his plan\nFor certain things a little too late condom yesterday while I mean I said this about a month and a half ago yeah I didn't think this race was going to end up being very close I felt governor do she would win and I thought he would win by

you say you know what\nYou know or maybe you're a Democrat and you say oh I said I'm not voting produce he's not gonna do anything on education or you're a Republican and you say hey that Guy Garcia wants to open borders people pretty much already made their mind up\nBut we already know that it is independent that will decide these elections that is true yeah but it sounds like ... he's getting his message across according to polls like Lucy leads Garcia by twelve points\nFor undecided could decide\nWell there you go we're talking about undecided Senate race that we're discussing now is cinema against mix Sally you're right about eleven percent of voters say they still are unsure who they would vote for cinema or mix Sally\nFor the a Senate seat that Jeff Flake is going to lead a by the way Martha McSally the Republican joins us today in Studio at five Fifteen ... anything and everything to make sure you're at five Fifteen a mix Sally in Studio but\nYeah ... percent of voters

word the or the next to her name she says the word independent like Arizona I mean if they if they very crafty skilled way probably going after the independent vote or make Sally just going down the hard line up\nShe doesn't support troops he doesn't support this she doesn't support this she watched child prostitution you know\nLook ... it comes down to that independents are going to decide this election as well but it's too close to call right\nNow and I'm not surprised with that\nSentiment led mix Sally forty three\nTo twenty nine percent among independent voters so far\nAs I tell you where the select right and might yeah maybe\nThree or three story on the all Arizona daily download Arizona and land on ... yeah I mean\nIt's interesting that Brett Kavanaugh is a conservative Arizona is supposed to be more of a conservative state but have they don't want to see him nominated to the U.S Supreme Court they it's or evenly divided over whether they believe that allegation that he sexually assaulted a girl when he was at that party with doc now Dr\nFord well also there is some breaking news at the White House expects to receive the FBI report on Kavanaugh soon then they're going to send it I guess to Capitol Hill but the Senate right now is expecting that FBI reports so we'll\nSo we'll we'll be covering this throughout the day will be monitoring Twitter 'cause I'm sure the president will will have his unfiltered react shall we don't follow them anymore\nI I Will be monitoring Twitter I Will be monitoring this is what he said well and\nYou know what I don't think we're ever going to understand this man because sometimes his policies are okay sometimes they're horrific like you know what separate women from children end up writing children there and sorry what did I say separating women have already families from their children and now\nAnd now he goes over over someone who is obviously you know sexually assaulted I'm not just us thing I'm not saying I I I'm not saying that I'm not standing up for the president\nBut I think he is pointing out stuff that we don't know and that maybe he feels is unfair because has the media actually question have they looked into\nThe day the time any of the allegations have they interviewed other people at the party so far we really haven't seen that\nAnd there will be people who will try to defend the president's saying as as the Sarah Huckabee Sanders said well he's just he's just reporting factories just stating facts that you know ... you know desert timeline fits is all that but again and this is important it's the tone and the audience\nHe's not saying to a bunch of reporters\nWell I I I I I respect her I I I validate her claim but I Would want more information I wouldn't want to know where you were what ... you know it's he's in front of an audience that he knows his friendly and all I kept thinking when I heard this\nIs that he is taking one last shot at Dr Ford and the Democrats\nBecause he either knows he doesn't have the votes for having a throat Kavanaugh through and he's got to go go through this all over again wants to just take one last shot at either it's one last shot or he is just so sad because he knows the FBI is going to find something we don't know\nThat he is lashing out this is what happens when you were asked to leave an event and you go out with a middle finger held high and basically you yell anything and everything that she might regret\nLike that's what a normal person would do Trump just likes to scold people all the time\n[noise] true true so it sounds to me like the reaction of lashing out like you know what I Know what's going to happen\nBut I Can't tell anybody so I'll just one last time and take a shot at her and take a shot at the Democrats and say you've ruined this man's life shame on you and go out that what he gets the audience to laugh at her of course\nThat gorgeous because he knows his audience will notice he do this in front of the media\nHe actually said to the media iris but I like I respect her and I welcome or testimony or something like that right and then he goes off on these high rates on Twitter and friendly events\nI I don't understand what's happened to this party man I mean I really don't I don't get it you know it's definitely Trump's party there's no question about it you know you've got guys like Lindsey Graham who kind of in the past has been pretty fair listen to this this was yesterday talking about cabinet\nI thought she was handled respectfully\nI thought ... was treated like crap\nYeah whoa whoa yourself here's what I\nSaw I mean it's it's it really is amazing that that I don't think the Republican thing hair Graham would stick up for a cabin on saying he wasn't treated with respect I mean I Know isn't that hard for the\nI'm surprised Lindsey Graham has has reacted throughout this whole thing I mean\nHis tirade you know right in front of Kavanaugh was unbelievable and he'll probably be remembered for that and I don't think that's a very good memory for people to have I've always thought he's pretty measured pretty smart guy you know surrounded himself with good people like John McCain\nAnd he just seems like a different guy after McCain past sorry but he does\nAnd you know if if the Republicans only have Jeff Flake to look at and say oh well maybe he can get the you know the the FBI to look into this ... the Republicans are in big trouble there in big trouble\nI just don't like the tone of Trump I don't like the tone of Lindsey Graham you know I think Jeff Flake he's a Republican I think he's totally out for himself he's running for president ah he's he's basically on this media to or I don't think that\nI don't think he asked for this FBI report because he was he was struggling over what happened you know during the the hearing I think he tried to save his own rear end and look good on it to to both sides let me get you an FBI investigation I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna wear any both sides yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna vote yes anyway but let's just put it out there\nSo I I don't know man I there are so many women they're running away from the Republican Party Jeanette ... Republican they're done so so the breaking news is the White House is expecting the receipts\nYou that FBI report and the FBI report could be wrapped up tonight and you know presented to the White House and to the senators and then we'll see the fallout ... we will actually see the fallout we're going to talk to Steve Gomez for FBI agent ABC News correspondent coming up at three\nUh about this report why now why not take a couple of extra days that you know things like that is a true they didn't talk to a cabinet or doctor forget why ... ... that if you don't talk to those do right\nAll
