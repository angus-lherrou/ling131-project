the step leopard right the period case club but\n[noise] who\nDidn't get in as far as at least the invite to be a nomination I feel we heard a few but now they're releasing the other names we talked about back\nDave Matthews blink one eighty two and to be part of this whole thing you have to release your first commercial album within twenty five years ago so essentially Nineteen Ninety three is when you had to have David bones dogs in harmony right counting crows\n... now I find this weird that they didn't get a nod at least to be nominated\n'cause I think they've done enough James addiction you know what the Perry feral and his own it probably so you gotta put genes addiction and they're just Buckley\nJudas Priest Kate Bush nine inch nails outcast Sheryl Crow usher and get ready for this bill snoop dog was denied\nLL cool but not snow really really\nOh I don't know about that but the only one of all\nOf this that I see that is absolutely a much that is going to get in there is these cats\n[noise]\n\nAnd think about this for a second bill you don't have to give all you know like full awards to everybody [laughter]\nOh [laughter]\nWas that wrong that was wrong but\nHere's why I don't think it's hard for those you know give you score their drummer has one arm and but he was a drunk driving accident All right\nUm I don't remember if he was driving drunk or if he just lost control yeah so\nSo Chad doesn't make any tips to wrong come on everybody laugh and I love the fact that death leopard right like they first of all they sold a hundred million copies of the route secondly and this is most than it was Rick out and raise a drummer yeah that's him yeah so\nUh and said I I think if I'm correct they they weren't going to continue with Rick couldn't do it so they had to build ... special drum set to you know ah it was December thirty first image girlfriend countryside\nTrying to pass a card high speed lost control of his bet\nUh and uh it was it was awful it was horrible uh but they ... they built them a special\nWith the cold but was it world when women they yeah for electric pedals for his left for the play the\nPieces he used to play with his other hand so uh how is he feel like you are drum dude I mean is he still kick ass\nI went to see them on the first or after that and it was it was just amazing yeah it is it is it is\nThey're they're incredible joy it's their lead singer Joe is a I mean they are they trying to explain to people they've sold well over a hundred million copies they've got two albums that have sold over ten million copies in the U.S alone\nYeah\nLike the biggest selling band of the nineties and you guys can singer hate mail I'm okay with that it's okay that's the beauty of comedy as we we we we look at a line we kind of get to it because of crossing like\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter coming up next as the guy who's going to get hate mail for and I'm okay with that but when people ask why don't you have people on the left on as I explained\nEarlier I invite everybody to come on the show everybody laughed right it doesn't matter you know who takes the invitations more often than not the right side of the core looming to ask you is going to join us yeah former campaign\nManager for Trump is going to join us right now he's working these senior advisor and ah for vice president or\nA political action committees gonna Joyce you talk about stuff that happened today right like this morning with Nikki Haley will talk about Kevin ... we're going to talk about two thousand twenty because I have an interesting question about who I think if the Democrats are smart they would put up to run against Trump\nBut we all know that they aren't going to do that we'll talk about that three two three five three twenty four joins your adventure shows your Twitter C. H. A. V. E. N. S. O. N. ... [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nAre you fifth year older okay well I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand so don't worry but I Do want to ask you have you signed up for a Mac yet if your answer is no why it's a free membership for one year you don't even have to give them credit card information\nAnd just for signing up here's some of the stuff you're going to recede just some forty percent off movie tickets access the supplemental dental plans up the sixty percent off forty percent off theme parks like SeaWorld legal and Disneyland and more discounts for hotel bookings at rental cars do that's\nThere a party that has no future and look their goal is\nDismantle ice let MS Thirteen run rampant give you know illegal immigrants more freedoms voting authority all these things and this president has said look let's run on my record of accomplishment lowest unemployment forty nine years\nA three point seven percent the greatest job growth that we've seen in decades the stock market's up Seventeen percent since he was elected African American Hispanic unemployment lowest ever recorded every economic indicator shows that we're our country is moving in the right direction\nAnd so this notion that the Democrats had this blue wave coming I think is a fallacy\nI predict the Republicans gained seats in the U.S Senate whether it's two three four or five that is coming and I would not be surprised to see a closer margin but the Republicans have the opportunity to hang on\nPresident Trump is going to Iowa tonight he's out campaigning for candidates out there who are running on the Trump Pence agenda and he's reminding voters of exactly what is at stake for weeks from today which is the opportunity to continue to move forward or the opportunity to go backwards and put\nNancy Pelosi and as a speaker of the house and as a very scary prospect for a lot of people\nYeah she's super excited about that she she feels comfortable that saying that that have listeners\nStruck down ski a a senior advisor for\nThe vice president's mood will actually committed to you know I look at two thousand twenty it's never too early and we already saw over the weekend you know the Cory Booker Spartacus was out there in Iowa many more heading out there doing their thing it's that time of year and I look out there and I said to myself I don't see anybody on the horizon\nThat for me on the left side that that puts fear that the people that are rolling out there seem to be the same old same ... and and there's a question to me ...\nI like her I find her to be interesting I think she was the only one of the Democrats the ... with the transition team for Trump and she gets pushed to decide because of this political machine that the Democrats continue to do throw out there and it makes me laugh because they're they're not they don't have a winning formula to have an identity\nAnd it ... it makes me laugh because I'm thinking to myself\nWell what's to be worried about if this is what you guys are going to continue to do\nWell ... it's a great question right and and the answer is no agenda no priorities no solutions that the Democratic party and so you know where we're going right now for weeks from today is a it's it's truly an inflection point and\nThe people of this great country have the opportunity to go back and say do we want a Jerry ...\nTo me the chairman committee Adam Schiff to be the chairman of the permanent select committee on intelligence uh Maxine Waters to be the chairman of the financial services committee if that's what you want and you want to have your tax cuts rescinded\nThat's what the Democrats are running on and it's the complete\nOne hundred and eighty degree opposite of what the Republicans are saying the Republicans are looking at more tax cuts to release more economic prosperity to get the burden of government off of people's backed by cutting more regulations look well known even talks about is the fact that the president said for every one new government regulation in place\nI'm going to delete to he didn't do that he deleted twenty two so for every one new regulation twenty two have been cut and that is unleash\nMassive amounts of economic prosperity and small businesses giving them the confidence to grow and expand which is something that hasn't happened in this country in decades\nIf you look out though in the future who would you say it's going to give Trump a crazy run you know I saw ban and out there and he likes ... and he thinks somebody to take on Trump has to be fearless has to be able to\nTo to push back a little if you looked out there in the landscape because it's never too early start talking to them they're out there campaigning already who do you think you know you know this person this person right here\nThey have their their their stuff together they can make them\nLook here let me give you who the potential options are Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts okay not a real candidate a Camilla Harrison California Cory Booker from New Jersey and then a couple of other ... senators maybe a governor maybe the mayor of a South Bend Indiana\nThe guy the only guy that I think is a real potential Kennedy and it's because of his financial ...\nThat's because of his financial wherewithal is Michael Bloomberg but he is so far to the left when it comes to the second amendment when it comes to mainstream issues but Michael Bloomberg has the ability to write a check he could write a two hundred and fifty million dollar check tomorrow and it's a rounding error in his bank account\nRight and anybody who has that type of access to capital becomes a serious candidate he's a he's a man who's demonstrated that it's put a hundred million dollars of his own money to run for mayor of New York into the race and I want to see a guy like Michael Bloomberg because I Want to go on remind\nAll the people in this country of how left his policies are are they exactly how he destroyed New York city after inheriting it from Mayor Giuliani and all of the things that went badly and under his leadership so\nLook I think what you're gonna find is you're going to find a a free for all maybe Joe Biden gets into the race maybe Hillary Clinton gets back in the race and not talking about recycling John Kerry into this thing look if that's the case that tells you the Democratic party has\nNo future whatsoever and their four or five leading candidates are all recycled whether it's John Kerry and Joe Biden Hillary Clinton or someone like that these are all failures and it's time to move in a different direction and I think they're going to try and a balanced this ticket\nBy having a Michael Bloomberg and then you know some ultra progressive ultra liberal on the ticket and that is going to do them which is perfect for us because the American people love with Donald Trump is doing\nNot so I you know and I I again the the Bloomberg thing would be interesting like I said I'm a fan of ... I think she would give everybody runs his money but she's on the side she's out of mind she's in Hawaii and I don't think\nTo to the to the radical left she's not far enough left and she makes too she's when I called the the the the ... the logical left and they don't want any part of that anymore do you think you have to be a billionaire with was named cache or you have to be you know ... or ... Smith warn you have to go off the reservation\nTalking [laughter] I don't think of the ah what'd you think of the cabinet and stuff I mean if it was a nightmare I think he could have been handled himself a little better at times but this\nMust not pretend that this was anything other than the ... an absolute political you know gamesmanship by by the left\nIt was and you have to remember this if it was anybody other than Donald Trump as the president that states they would have folded under the pressure of the left\nUnder the paid protesters under the fake news you know attacking Kevin uh everyday attacking his family going after his credibility\nRight some other Republican president would have pulled Brett Kavanaugh's nomination but not Donald Trump he stood fast he doubled down and he was ultimately proven to be right and if you saw last night what he said he had to apologize\nTo Brett Kavanaugh for the way that he was treated by the media and that's a sad state of affairs because it wasn't that long ago when Supreme Court justices would be confirmed in a widely bipartisan manner whether it's sixty Seventy or eighty vote\nNot this one anymore because Washington is so broken that now we're fighting over something that potentially you know Brett Kavanaugh had a beer thirty five years ago when he was Eighteen years old is a senior in high school and that's what we're arguing over and it's just insanity and I think what this what this nomination process has done\nIs unified the Republican Party and it reminded them that complacency is not an option and if they want to stay home because their economy is better their homeland security's better their national security for the economic security is better than there are consequences for staying home and the cabinet fight is a clear reminder of that\nCrazy crazy last question appreciates criminal court Lewandowski rock and Roll Hall of fame has made the announcement of their ... nominees this year so I ... you know no ... got nominated ...

I'm just\nI've been looking for a couple of weeks that the math for all of our findings to the south and starting to\nGet out of the cat and it it would take a good six to seven years for us to get out of debt on our current income and as part of it is seeing the oil and I never graduated but\nI was thinking about cash flowing the rest of my degree and going back to school and I would start as if you hire and then I have two year work to finish but I Would have to do it a lot slower than you know I have five kids and a few jobs trying to get through\nOur through the spraying the\nBudgeting stuff I'm trying to cut that and I don't\nKnow how much it would be on on account of how much does it have you got not counting your home\nUm we don't even own a home sometime when I leave that sixty five thousand\nHow much of the neighborhood and loans uh forty okay which sealed the twenty five\nAnd the rest of the medical and we have a five hundred dollars a carton\nMhm so medical and student loan ... watch much medical\nAnd I have five kids at random trip to the emergency room and end up costing\nYou don't have health insurance\nAnd we did during most of it um but like there's been a couple of times like between jobs when insurance wasn't covering and we couldn't pay for cobra what were you studying in college\nAnd I was studying business um but I actually currently on a seamstress\nAnd I do alteration for a bunch of people on it and Vail mhm right next to the Walmart headquarters so I get a lot of cuts versus stop and I really want to start a plus plus size clothing line because I Need for that market but I Want to go back and get my fashion design of march and I think one degree\nAnd that's just where\nThat's where I'm at like I Love sewing that's my heart when needed degree\nI I Know that there's a lot of stuff right now and I like I Know how to do the patterns and stuff but there's a lot of other stuff that\nYou you don't I don't we don't need a dollar a new knowledge\nYeah OK ... books and and I guess I just\nGot to take classes and not having to actually get the degree I'd be totally for it you\nKnow it's fun you know when you move to take all that we took all the same classes because you're oh you're wanting to learn how to a run the business and be be better at fashion design yeah OK so took some version design classes last fall and you can kind of slow down what do you make\nAnd the clean me and my husband we make about forty five thousand\nTwenty five thousand yeah I don't know if you work full time\nYeah like what I'm One of my God you know it's a lot I like I work as a boutique that are going to\nYou know hourly employee and stuff like that and then a try I've been thinking about going and trying to get a job but I also have to pick up truck full of me trying to get a job like that it's kinda\nCrazy and so even my husband's like keep past not he started by keep bringing home it's usually an extra thousand dollars of stuff with overtime and stuff but helping us get on our feet but we were\nLike okay even we're showing your home was bringing home an extra thousand others I didn't even add up with what you're talking about so what does he make\n'em [laughter] he makes it harder our\nOkay All right in and how long has he been doing that and just the past year okay All right\nSo you're wrong you don't my twenty five Fifteen dollars an hour is thirty thousand a year\n[noise] oh I think I I I was going by what we are bringing home [laughter]\nDo you have too much coming out of your check them okay way too much to me I was in church and if he's makes thirty thousand dollars\nTo make thirty thousand dollars a year and he's bringing home an extra one thousand dollars that's forty two thousand dollars a year\nOkay it's twenty five with five kids is below the poverty level that's why I was freaking out I was trying to figure out what that world you're doing where you're not making a living and so what do you make gross before taxes at your seamstress work\nAnd I I bring home ... addict out\nOK you are now you do not need to spend any money on education and do you get your interest income up okay\nFashion designers not holding you back you don't have enough volume to your business\nActually justify spending any money on education in that business yeah you just have found something you love\nAnd that's not a bad thing I Want to help you expand it you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to put you in college for business it's called business boutique academy by Christie right the or her book in her book is called business boutique and it's equipping women to make money doing what they love\nAnd we're going to put you in that academy the academy is closed but I Know a guy since I own it I can get you in\nIraq and I'll put you in there with them and there's a bunch of ladies there and a bunch of classes there that you take it's not going to cost you a dime I'm giving it to you OK okay and that's you go in there and take all those classes get in those groups you learn from these women\nHow ... how how business works and how to grow there'll be some people in their own fashion design that can help you\nAnd I want you to start making\nFifty or sixty thousand dollars a year before you worry about taking a fashion design clash okay\nAnd then when you get to that point because you're working that many hours and you're producing that much stuff and maybe even you've got your first seamstress are just working for you then we'll start worrying about your designs\nBut we got to get your volume up in the business acumen you have to get the business to where it has legs under before you justify becoming educated in ... at this let this point especially with no more money than you guys have got with five kids so I Want to get some income coming in you hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will get you signed up for business boutique academy\nIt's closed Kelly they're not they're not taking orders anymore but I'm putting her in it's OK so just tell the business boutique folk over there that they've said All right Billy is with us from Dayton, Ohio I Believe welcome today Ramsey show\nHey Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up with\nMy wife and I are in the process of trying to consider buying a house the challenge will run into is that we own to rental houses and we currently rent the one we live and then we don't want to take on more debt and so we're trying to figure out whether we should sell the rental properties or\nUm you know how the just sort of finagle that and I'm not getting into too much debt\nOkay do you have um what is one of these rentals worth\nWell one of the challenges that we face is that the rental properties are actually out of town on them on the military guy and we're currently living in Dayton, Ohio rental properties already Georgia in Virginia so I'm the value sell them\nYes I Would not long distance landlord okay\nNo that's your health and they were asking for trouble you need the money you're in the military are trying to buy a home and you need the money and you don't need to be alone you got you did not set out to own rental property everywhere these rental properties by default\nWas not you're not you're five your strategy to buy rental properties all over the United states\n\nSo that the inclination that I've been getting from a couple of folks that have been talking to my mom I haven't been seen though is that they've been successful I've had renters that have been paying the mortgage and um it seems like there there's the possibility of it how you're going up\nAnd put them under the values go up but I'm also sure somebody's gonna change their hardly oil in your living room because you're out of town [noise] this is going to happen I I I've got rental properties man I got a bunch of 'em um rental property for forty years and um you've got to be I\nI just don't do any long distance landlord it I don't have any property that I ran out that is not in my town\nAnd you did not by not by the property spot plan you ended up with them and you're trying to move on to the next phase of your life which is home ownership\nYou you are long distance landlord and you don't even own your own home\nPersonally was so both of them are made it like you do what you want but that's what I\nThis is the Dave Ramsey show\nI get this question all the time they wouldn't it be smarter for me to sell my house myself the answer is really simple the typical for sale by own our home sales\nFor one hundred and Ninety thousand dollars for the typical home sold by an agent is two hundred and forty nine thousand dollars I'll do the math for you that's fifty nine thousand dollar difference\nYou would have just move the debt over onto your house dumb idea eighty eight\nPercent of the time that people take that Khan solid Asian looms out they don't change their habits and they're on their debts back up the only time I tell people to move that into a debt consolidation is to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're not asking me about either one of those\nSo I think your bank wants to see you deeply in debt does that's what banks do\nSo listen when a bank says hey I got a great idea what they're really saying is hey I can make some money off of you\nI mean really it's like playing with a skunk and wondering why you got sprayed seriously it's not it's not a pet it's a skunk so don't pet it lets\nYou this is what you're dealing with a with a bank so no chase no no no no no Allen on Twitter says I just got laid off and I need to move my four oh one K. tomorrow ...\nShould I go ahead and do that if I have a chance of coming back and working for the same company in the future I Would roll it to a regular IRA NATO Ross IRA because if you roll it to a traditional area you have no taxes and unless you got a real power money and just want to pay those taxes right now I Would not converted to Iraq\nBut what role at to a traditional even if you're going back because that portion then at least as in your control you restart your four O. one K. there's no advantage to having left your money back there no mathematical advantage of ignore advantage at all\nSo I Would take it\nWith me my accent in Abilene, Texas Mike welcome to Dave Ramsey show\nHey thanks for having me on short today better than I deserve how can I help um well you know you're burning question for you but I Know or shorter times all had to make one of them pretty quick [noise]

we're at three point seven five\nNo and not need to refinance if you pay a ... a thirty year mortgage if you calculate it three seven five your mortgage balances today and and just put it in a calculator and come up with your Fifteen year payment\nAnd that you know take your regular payment off of that not counting taxes and insurance okay take your principal interest payment off of that and if it's three hundred and forty two dollars more to pay a Fifteen year beautician an extra three hundred forty two dollars a month you're going to pay a thirty often exactly Fifteen\n... no benefit to refinancing alone in or ... except to save on interest rate and interest rates are higher now than your current interest rate is about point higher as a matter of fact\nAnd so you have you

P U and in my area everybody is already in session but some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still don't even go in\nYeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already ahead of the game on that you're you're in Michigan and you can go back and watch it on with your own line because you've got a one year membership and you can watch or listen to everything on line for a year\nOkay so yeah you go and watch the blessing one and then when you go in your ... whatsoever zone listen to your right in saying okay you know troubles are at all you're doing great way to go dawn you\nKilled a ghetto Christine ... with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have it as a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity\nAnd have since moved to Boise how much but we I'm Sorry what was that how much equity\nAbout two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it yeah I'm Still we're here just renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or by [laughter] um but I'm not quite sure because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\nOut of debt that we just go yeah we don't have any debt good um but do we just go and maybe pay cash for a house yeah what we want or do we\n... we want is we want where we you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have a talk and we'll put a small mortgage on it and pay it off real fast\nOkay you don't want to get anything I mean well I mean what's your household income or about a hundred and fifty okay and what what would you be talking about building or buying or price range\nOh price range between four and six\nAnd you have to forty and the bank mhm okay so if we should for forty as an example\nHave a two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right All right I'll bet you don't pay that off five years\nDabbling yep yeah I mean just knock it out or you go on I'm forty five and my husband if\nYou have any money in savings were investments to this not in a retirement account\nYeah it it all okay All right well my role is almost never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the pay much more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that right away and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred two hundred for developing\nOur mortgage you don't really find house in Boise idaho for a half million dollars that's a long ... wonderful property and\nRead about what we're hoping more property then that they have\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights and so I'm mean your bang for buck is huge in Boise compared to\nYou know a big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words\nI'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later\nAnd that's how we would do it because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever\nBut if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case though just how the different mindset that the mortgage is more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast and like other people's ... to Carla like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let us get after it and that's how I Want to think about it so really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worrying about eight to ... ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars a day and start my emergency fund like card paid off\nWhat is your household income about\nThirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen does ... what you have too much tied up on things going down in value when you're how when your car or things with motors your wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our house and they included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and\nThen we got a divorce and we sold the house and the car we paid off\nGot it okay and I got the car and so what is your um what is your income\nProspects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around thirty thirty tail so you don't see ... you'll see there's doubling them\nNow okay why\nI ... I haven't got school yet okay and I'm a single mother fighter and\nYeah you you need the money more than you need that car don't you\nYeah you know I in the cars going down their value quick show yeah Charlotte pay off your debt but your emergency for unemployed you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range okay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything what wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt it's going down about you and when you have all of that stuff I had it together you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your annual income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper in your case you're going to change your income by going to school and so he's going to change later\nBut for right now I'm with you yeah I was shocked that cost this is the ... [noise]\n\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment\nSo this is your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup and just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage can tell you if you could save some cash each month they've helped thousands upon thousands of my listeners keep more cash in their pockets through smarter mortgage\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interest 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now it's not a lot of risk because you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but er an investment to pay it off but there is risk\nIn show or you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of foreclosures or her own home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWhat I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula because when you don't have a mortgage your start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money\nYour relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money shut all about to say if I woke up and your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if ... if this discussion good sour on you and you think they ram she's crazy a year from now just get you into the mortgage\nNo I I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that he got space just if it's a lot of money I'd go you know I just go I mean I just paid off but my mind sort of just wrestle back and forth for\n... and I what I'm trying to point out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula yet it that's what I'm pointing out is that makes sense completely yeah\nPaid off that you got this thanks for the call open phones AAA eight to five five two to five see your heart story it's not really you guys your heart your heart's where you measure risk\nMy heart's telling me pay off my house my hands telling me I could make more money on these ... ...\nWhat's your heads missing some stuff it's missing risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this with a clash of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I got a finance degree I was taught to borrow money my ... finance professor used to teachers to borrow money and so um you know it it's broke finance professor is like a shop teacher was missing fingers right people so think about this right so I got it you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show um\nBut as you can really do a very\nSophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really in the radio to walk through the whole thing but\nWhat happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero debt and you looked over in your four O. one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for your emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many of you just said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I work for and I would go do dot dot dot unless you go in business for yourself necessarily might just have a different career you might go on a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know and here's the weird thing is that thing you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're going to live your passion you make half the money you make twice the money\nYou make more money when you're doing something and you're good at 'cause you work harder at at your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself from it because you love it\nYou don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article I Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down here and doing this radio show when I'm In town I\n...\nAnd I'm really good at it as a consequence incomes once I get paid a lot\nA lot of money\nOn a shame middling I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this I'm here baby\nThat's how I don't want that for you see that's what set you up to be how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your boss is a jerk to stick it\nTake this job and shut it I mean we would do that yeah there you go that's it man and I'm not\nTelling you quit your job today I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond the simple mathematics of the fact you don't have to\nYou start to be set free slavery is more than simple\nThe change of the ...\nIt changes your relationship [noise]\nSlave bar or his way\nLove that call thank you sir that's\nThis is the rams are shot [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from
