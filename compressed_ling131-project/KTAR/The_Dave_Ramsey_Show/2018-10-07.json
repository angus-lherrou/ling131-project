I've been deeply involved with ... researchers in India and seeing all of that and with Reza Vera trial I've worked with scientists in Europe\nAnd also in California in ... in South Africa all of which are major red wine producing areas so I've had the opportunity to investigate these things in the field meet with the top scientist than my conclusion is that\nGreen tea Kirk human from to recruit and ... from red wine are remarkable health and Hansing agents that everybody can benefit from the very very substantial way\nYes we're supposed to talk about these big three and it's interesting that they're found in our diet and only considered supersede the green tea human humans very ... why did you want to combine just read there's always a message to your\nYour madness if I can see it that way because you combine these things together because they have a synergistic effect you meet each other more spend you know in a real game changer\nWell you know when I look at the is there actually isn't a reason path to\nPut them all in separate products they do go very well together as you said they're all food derived so it's kinda like you can make a salad if you choose out of many vegetables you don't just have to have a bowl of lettuce or a bowl of cucumbers and well that's a little bit simplistic the fact is that\nAll of these are very very rich in groups of protective compounds that are both\nAntioxidant so they actually retired the aging process of the cells in our bodies\nAnd protect our organ systems till they maintain a healthy inflammatory status in the body and this is really a big breakthrough I also like the idea that people can get a concentrated supplement of green tea extract curriculum and extracting resume or a trial\nIn one product with truly meaningful amounts of each one and not have to go out and basically by a shopping cart full of stuff\nLet's dive into the headlines and the research especially on the green tea because it's absolutely amazing\nI Know when he shouldn't have been using it for thousands of years for the G\n... what you've seen recently in the press you know you told me the nutrition research journal and it's July ... issue revealed the green tea significantly increased plasma anti oxygen activity inhale blood get assigned to recap\nSome of these headlines of chill me while you're such a green tea advocates\nOkay what you just said about increasing plasma antioxidant activity is really critical there are many antioxidants that people consume\nBut don't actually wind up in the body or they don't wind up in the body in any significant amount\nThe green tea antioxidants which we know are among the most highly beneficial antioxidants in the entire world are very well absorbed they improve plasma antioxidant activity that is the blood concentration of antioxidants so what happens is\nYou get this great concentration of antioxidants substances which a protective compounds floating around in the body and protecting the cells\nOf your body your organs every part of your body from premature destruction due to exposure to environmental pollutants and things in the diet with regard to the whole blood glue to sigh on when we take in\nThe right antioxidants and not all antioxidant compounds are the right antioxidants our bodies produce more of its own super protective compound called glue to ...\nSo you've taken the green tea extract\nYou build the antioxidant activity in your blood and you also cause your body to produce this enormously beneficial very well studied very powerful protective substance called glue to thigh on so it is remarkable this isn't something that most high antioxidant\nFoods or supplement ingredients do but it does happen with a concentrated properly made green tea extract\nLet's switch gears and talk about this human which is number two on your list by the way these three ingredients are all found in the new green tea humble formula would be offering free bought him a few minutes we'll talk to me about the human\nYou smelled C.

you're you're in it and um we know you are and it comes to curls a situation about the\nID and I think that's important I mean ...\nPrivate place we're only talking for governmental operations and nothing else but we don't want to have in this nation\nLinguistic ... where people are speaking different languages in their own community and or you know the government has there are things translate into so many different languages that you lose sight you know the\nFact that he wishes and calm and unifying language in this nation we want to avoid that because again we see around the world how it has not worked out well\nAnd the other place where you have a multiplicity of different languages competing with each other and\nDo you see this an issue in any way for them in terms or for that twenty twenty presidential election\nAbsolutely I think it was even an issue in twenty six thing and again we know where President Trump issued on immigration\nAs opposed to where Hillary Clinton stood we know the President Trump when he was a kid it was frequently saying that in order to assimilate in the usa you need to speak English right now what we're doing is that we're holding candidate speak to the\nFire all across the nation whether it's federal racist congressional races or even state municipal raises asking them how do they feel about official English legislation\nWe're willing to work at the state level as well right now thirty two states across the usa have English as the official language of their state Michigan hopefully will become the thirties or this year\nSo we do a lot of work in the city as well and we have an old all of our supporters would talk to every candidate whether someone running for Congress for Senate and for local races corrupt state Senate governor or whatever\nHow do they feel about official in which legislation because if they support something like an English language unity I like the federal level or state version of that and that's a good thing we do want to be an issue in twenty Eighteen and then also in twenty twenty and the next presidential races well\nWhere is the Marco Rubio for example and Senator Ted Cruz on this issue well in\nBoth of those cases of two senators who you originally were great friends with the Tea Party movement and news said words that are very sympathetic\nTo official English like human example back in twenty ten\nWhen Senator Rubio was still a candidate\nHe did a wonderful video for us where he was a strong proponent of official English legislation of the English language unity act\nSince that time though he is not how sponsored the bill in the United States Senate and we want to encourage Senator Rubio to back up his own words and become a co sponsor of the English language you react as he said that he was supporting in twenty than Senator Cruz as well as Senator Cruz is a friend we met with him we met with his staff any many times\nThese in a very very difficult race right now for reelection attacks us\nThan we think that his co sponsorship of the English language unity I Do something that would help him in his race\nYou know we're a nonprofit organization were five oh one C. three so we cannot endorse candidates but again if you're running particularly in a mortar state and you support official English legislation in a place like Texas\nThat has to be very helpful in a state like that and so we encourage Senator Rubio in Florida and Senator Cruz in Texas to both become cosponsors of the English language and\nFinally well they both come around do you anticipate before these midterms\nYou know in senator Cruz's case it might be more of a possibility where he is running for reelection again this year Senator Rubio just rented\nWas reelected in twenty sixteen so I don't know where that is on his radar for twenty eighty per se but hopefully senator Cruz's case yes given he's up for re election right now\nSee them do shop the executive director of the

animal lover so she's decided to mellow them out before putting them in the pot and as they go in the pot they don't feel as much pain according to her she says it's an act of kindness and humanity\nShe is a registered medical marijuana caregiver and she says she's more than a\nKnowledgeable about marijuana affects\nA than your ordinary chef she also makes the claim that\nThe lobsters that are high before they die in the pot are more succulent Carl I'll start with you the state department and I the ... and the state health department says this is not going to continue they are not amused I Wonder if the state is over acting\nIn this regard and leave her alone let the lobsters get high and maybe that client will get high the customer will get I and everybody will be happier\nWhether that's exactly what they're worried about writers because I've been told for Newsweek regrets I mean first off there's ... there's no reason to believe that there'd be any

somehow you know trying to do something about the shrinking lobsters are dilemma partly true when\nMike what do you what do you think she loves animals she doesn't want the lobster to freak out and die and grown and moan underneath all that water when we get near it\nAnd uh and so give them a little drug to ... to make a mellow while they go meet their maker\nOf being a mob street or from I'm

the meat is better with the ... before cooking the lobster is happy or the people are happier what's not to like in the government is doing overreach but you now are saying oh I don't want a lobster is that all the hard to do with it\nI mean it yeah it's become very psychological uh with me I this poor thing going into the ... I mean I knew what I cook them and everything else but now I'm I'm not sure I can enjoy a lobster again it's it's\nGreat I like my ... I Lived in Maine too as well when I'm back in\nMy ...

Court and that is the obvious\nTopic of this week our guest today is deemed Paul bender ASU law school former among other things principal deputy solicitor general of the United states welcome to the show\nTo show me\nWell I'm I have to start with a confession because uh we are taping this on Thursday and as of this moment\nThe a vote on justice perspective justice cabinet is scheduled for tomorrow and we don't know how that's going to go but I my reading of the tea leaves as he's probably going to get confirmed\nSo we want to talk about among other things um what is the agenda that the Supreme Court is likely to face this week and why would his presence or absence on the court\nLikely impact in terms of some of the decisions that were going to face a this term ... but what I wanted to start with his late last night I saw that there was a a a letter signed by\nSix hundred and fifty plus law professors ... suggesting the judge cabinet should not be confirmed in your signatures was one of them I Wonder if you could comment on your reasoning\nYeah the letter is about his um his temper and his ah\nHis attitude of\nRevenge that he expressed during the hearings rather than about is jurisprudence\nOf because of the people who signed that letter come from all different jurists prudential areas there are some conservatives and liberals but it's all about him as a person and basically it says that he revealed a personality a temper a lack of self control and a sense of revenge\nWhich was to me the most important thing where he said what goes around comes around and he mentioned a whole bunch of groups that he knew were against him and some of those groups are engaged in a lot of Supreme Court litigation like Planned Parenthood for example and he said you know\nThe I Know those people are against me and what goes around comes around that's a threat to rule against them it just doesn't sound like in shouldn't be the kind of thing that somebody I'm any federal court blood on the Supreme Court\nShould say or do a ... it's just it's so on judicial his uh his behavior during the hearing when he made a city prepare those remarks himself a and it was so full of revenge and nastiness and combative miss that people watching that\nIncluding me are very likely to worry about whether he can be impartial in any case of a political significance so that's what that letter was about\n... I think you would normally referred to as judicial temperament right\nYeah right uh you know I I have never ever seen a judge federal or state behave in the way that he behaved in that hearing his aggressiveness\nIs nastiness as bad as it is a is is a dismissive treatment of people I'm I'm sure judges of express themselves that way in private but in public I've just never seen anything like it's about this was about this on judicial is anything imaginable\nI wandered listening to that how much of that was private counseling Donald that's a Donald Trump style no prisoners or you know it ... nothing attack attack attack exactly\nAnd you know however you feel about what we feel about Donald Trump very few people would think of some of them is somebody who are on the court\n... his ... has been on a court and it's thought to be quite a good judge\nShe's senior status now I think and I I've heard some people are\nA sort of got semi some not decide in some of them they said uh\nYou know okay it's too late we're not going to apply to twenty eight team but uh may be may or may be hum in effect in twenty twenty are there any the in the sort of boating gerrymandering in that whole range of cases what do you see on on the horizon\nThere's nothing on the docket now\nUm but there is undoubtedly going to be either later this term or next term that's a really interesting situation last year the court granted review and political gerrymandering case\nThat almost everybody thought they were finally going to decide whether there will meaningful constitutional limits on political gerrymandering that they should have been up several times before them\nAnd the most recent thing that happened is that Justice Kennedy had said in the last ... you know none of those cases did they decide what the rules are if any about political gerrymandering the last time before last year that the case of before the court Justice Kennedy said\nYou know I Know political gerrymandering is unconstitutional to some extent my only problem is how you define it and what that extent is\nAnd that's what I'm waiting to find a\nSo this case was presented to the court in a way that those are the people who want it to to get the constitution apply try to draft arguments where they could say the Kennedy hey here's how you do it\nAnd it looked like he was very seriously thinking about doing that but the court did not decide the issue because they decided\nThe plane and said no standing\nA that was just the way that they use when they don't want to decide sort of thing to to get rid of the case so they didn't decide the issue\nThat case got sent back and everybody including me it was saying okay now when the plane is when they have when the plaintiffs show that have standing the case they'll come back and now Kennedy fun it will have the court decide one way or another on what's really important issue and then he retires\nAnd let me just in case somebody got lost in the in the ... their political gender men ... write the legal too gerrymandered to write the districts so that for example blacks or Hispanics are excluded from being elected if they're that they that that's the legal\nBut the court has never uh up to this point decided that you can't uh set up the district so that one party wins disproportionally and that appears to be what's on the horizon potentially might not have yet\nTo exactly that's the issue is possible if you draw district lines if you have free play an drawing district laws that you can if you were a minority party\nYou can district the steak in a way that gives you a majority in the state legislature and if you're a slight majority party you can read district in a way that gives you a big majority\nBy packing your opponents into districts are so that they have less districts where they have they have any chance of winning a and you give them some safe districts but I is in return for that\nYou take a lot of districts that are fairly closely divided um everybody does that to some extent\nAnd it's become a national scandal\nBecause for example if you take the house of representatives so last couple of elections\nA significantly greater number of people voted for democratic candidates than Republican candidates for the house of representatives in both the last two congressional elections and yet in both of them the Republicans had significant majorities in the house of representatives how did that happen\nIt happens because of gerrymandering\nAnd the case that it was before the court last year was from Wisconsin where there was proof of really impressive gerrymandering Republicans said gone from a slight minority party in a in some of the how's the legislature to a fairly good majority\nAnd that was clear that that it happened and so it was thought to be a fairly strong case and that's why everybody who was one thing the court to set some rules here was hoping it happened last year\nAnd now the Kennedy has a retired uh there's nobody I shouldn't say this number four liberals would like to I think a stylish constitutional rules\nAbout how much political gerrymandering is too much but now with his\nCabinet are should be confirmed or there will be five people who\nDo interest I think one of the things and we just a minute we're on their way out of your ... find interesting is that he was influenced by the fact that a statistician came up with the way to measure it up to that point need sort of took the position okay I can kind of recognize it smells mad but what's the standard

cagey a our news on Ninety two three Afghan [noise]\nShall deprive somebody it doesn't repeat the bill of rights it says no stay she'll deprive somebody of life liberty or property without due process what does that mean\nSome people have thought that that means that the whole bill of rights then suddenly became applicable to the states free speech for religion drawing usual punishment et cetera\nThe court's not happening what search and seizure and and those things I write\nA court over the years starting at the end of the nineteenth century uh and going up until today as step by step incorporated more and more of the bill of rights and the fourteenth amendment\nSo free speech and freedom of religion and establish a religion and unconstitutional search and seizure all of those bill of rights rules apply to the states\nUh by ... and in the same way they apply to the federal government that is the free expression rules supposed to be the same\n... protecting you against state as well as federal action but they never incorporated everything\nThe grand jury requirements for example in the bill of rights it does not apply to the states one of the things that they never decided to incorporate\nHas been the excessive fines closer the eighth amendment and so the issue here is whether that should be added to the list of things that are incorporated\nAnd I think they're it seems pretty likely that the court will will do that will incorporate that they've incorporated virtually everything else and it it they've already incorporated a cruel and unusual punishment part of the eighth amendment\nSo I Would think they do the same thing with the excessive fines or\nIs there any any ... so he got the bill of rights and and and and it originally applied only to the federal government to fourteenth amendment is put in and one after the other ... the courts are deciding that means that applies to the states is there any logic at all\nAs to why uh any distinction should be made it if if the fourteenth amendment extends constitutional rights or to the state to state level issues on some things he's in the logic the same that it should apply to all\nOf a few it depends on how you think about it if if the issue is just hey as a right to free speech if as a federal right to free speech why shouldn't have stayed right to free speech be the same\nIt seems pretty clear that you would just incorporated a the same but the judges have said over the years\nThat that's too simplistic that there might be reasons why the federal protection\nOf free speech might be more extensive or less expensive than the state protection of free speech the best example of why that might be true I think is in the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule\nUh the ... they're mostly the discipline and regulate police that you exclude the evidence that they illegally sees in order to try to get them not to illegally sees evidence\nHow ... how much you want to do that I think probably could will depend upon whether the local\nPolice are sensitive to the Fourth Amendment or not if you have a local police off as a as a local police group that never violates\nOr the Fourth Amendment only occasionally will there be an unconstitutional search and then you get a case where is really important crime and illegally see evidence and it shows the guy's guilty you might say gee we don't need to discipline art police\nOr because they they don't generally violate the rules and so why let this\nCriminal go free because of the police mistake whereas if you're in a jurisdiction where the police\nTend to ignore the Fourth Amendment then you might want to have a much more of a an exclusion\nRule is much stronger and more protective so that's the kind of constitutional right which it might make sense to interpret differently from state to state and that's the argument against it automatic incorporation of everything\nOf course no jurisdiction is going to freely admitted their police departments are habitually violators of um uh\nWell no I I think some courts will and of course you ought to be sensitive to that and of course a state Supreme\nSees the whole run of cases of charges that the police violated the law and they get a good sense of whether the police of obeying the constitution and not and that might very well think gee we need to do something about it or they might think hey this is not a problem here so why look guilty\nYeah so I look guilty people go free because ... there's something wrong\nOkay we will we will conclude in just a moment when we return

representative Martha mix Sally in Studio representative great to see you again how are you\nAm great good to be back on\nGood to have you back on you know back and I've been talking about President Trump coming in Arizona you supposed to come I thought he was going to come in and campaign with you what's the deal does do you want him here to ... you know we're\nWorking with the White House absolutely uh only he can rally Republicans and remind them of ah what's at stake and so we're just working with White House there was some changes to a schedule related to the hurricanes and things that we're impacting it and uh you know it's not easy to fly all the way out here and they're trying to work with the rest of the schedule so\nI'm Will keep you posted I'm not going to making a big announcement if that's what you're looking for\nWell we're always looking for males do you think see All right I'm going to put it out there I was wondering if you didn't want them here in the United states seem part not\nLifted that fake news uh look I I'm Talking to every voter is out there uh that we can get to and talk to you and share when I'm done with my life but it ends has it been in Congress Democrats independents Republicans but I Know there's a section of people out there that no matter what they just are never going to vote for Republican I Know there's people out there they don't like\nYou know he treats and things but they may like that they got the tax cuts and the economy's doing well and we're rebuilding our military and working to secure the border so they made like the policy so I just ask those people who maybe don't like the demeanor and take a look at what I've done with my life taken look what I've done twenty six years in the military take a look what Congress rank the nights most affected member of Congress\nAnd I'm working with this administration for the things that are the highest priority for Arizona and then when it comes to Republicans ah you know who maybe are\nHappy you know there is nothing like being an opposition to get you fired up we saw that with eight years of Obama in office and how that impacted Republicans energy and so the left his energize right now uh so we need you know Republicans especially those who maybe don't voted Mitt terms to kind of\nWake up and realize what the stakes are not just for our state but the Senate majority which I'm a firewall to make sure we keep the Senate majority a and so the president coming in and reminding Republicans of that uh well I'm Talking to others about you know look look at my life look at the policies were working on a aunt and let's uh you know let's keep it keep it going\nThe other reason with representative Martha ... running for Jeff Flake seat in the Senate or the the other reason we thought maybe Donald Trump was going to come is that you you made an announcement\nOr the get out the vote rally with Mitt Romney in the east valley coming yeah in this month yes what is Mitt Romney how does how does he help get the vote when he and Trump are pretty much diametrically opposed when it comes to you know personality that kind of\nWell we have a big tent right uh and the Republican Party and a Governor Romney was endorsed by President Trump right and so\nUh we want to make sure that the Republicans again that are out there\nUh they're realizing the importance of this race for our state\nOr were in a dead heat right now there's a lot of money flowing into my opponent they realize that there's any chance to flip the Senate majority it goes through Nevada and Arizona and so talking to all Republicans you know whatever whatever whatever you know ... wing of the party or end is important for them to realize the you know the stakes here like what\nAm I going but what about the independent voters how ... how do you go down that road when a lot of people are saying that independence by this right well just like\nMy district I mean we're we're you know we're talking to everybody we can uh based on the facts are look what I've done with my life I look what I've poured my passion into which is fighting for our country\nDeploying six times three hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tent first woman ever to flying combat a first ever to command a fighter squadron look at what I've done a break glass ceilings for women you know for you\nYou know for you or the women independent voters out there for your daughter's a look at the example you know that I've been in order to break through a for you\nAnd then on the policy since I've been in Congress my second term and save the eight and ward hog I was able to get some really high priorities on our infrastructure bell to include I eleven and a son or a quarter which mattered to a lot of us we've cut your taxes we roll back regulations we've got a booming economy we're rebuilding our military I'm leading to secure the border\nYes [laughter] and I want to tell you both
