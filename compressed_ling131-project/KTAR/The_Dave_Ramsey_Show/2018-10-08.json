associates and author of the best selling book creating calm and the storm\nFill us is the first female advisor on the cover a senior market advisors magazine she was recently runner up advisor of the year for that publication\nSo glad to have her here today as we are going to be talking about the right questions to be asking and tell us\nHere's why we're going to talk about this I saw this article the other day about the right questions to ask your kids ways to connect with them a little bit more by asking\nDeeper questions than the standard how was your day or how school today and I know I Know you talk with your daughter on a regular basis and I know you go beyond that standard line of questioning because you need to be deliberate and the questions you asked to really understand what's going on with them\nI just think that's true for any of our relationships including the relationship we have with the advice or we're working with what do you think\nYeah absolutely I think that that really is key the difference between having the right\nRelationship with your advise and from my side of the table for the advisor having the right relationship with the clients and being able to do the best it's it's a huge difference from asking what I Would call a surface question mhm and then really going beneath the surface ... let me just\nSee it give you a couple of examples as an advisor when I asked the question\nWell so how much how much do you think you're going to need a month and retirement 'cause we're trying to build an income plan how would you think you need each month and and they give me a statement well I think only\nSeven thousand or eight thousand whatever the number is if I just stop there this is people's first rodeo into retirement mhm they haven't really necessarily thought through the whole process that's that may be just part of what they need\nBut what's really important is to\nFollow that up with well what do you need that what are you going to do that what's your time is going to look like only a little little travel well how are you going to travel\nWhat kind of chips or you're going to take I Can't tell you one we've taken a step further how helpful for that is for me from a play any perspective but for the client\nFor for ... from a planning perspective because people you know people's lifestyles are very different I said if I've said it wants to sit at a hundred times everybody has their own financial DNA and in that area everybody's going to spend differently in retirement and how can you build a plan if you really\nDon't have a good perspective of what that looks like\nAnd from the other side of the table really it's it's not good enough to say well um how long have you been in the business\nOr how many ... have\nWell how long have you been in business doing you know and what do you do a you know you've got to take it a lot deeper to really get to know why somebody does what they do the whole works right and build a relationship because I you know getting financially naked as I Would say it's comfortable\nWe'll see we'll have a good relationship you want to know that someone hears you I Want to know that people hear me and that they that they want the help that we can bring to the table and from their perspective I Would think that people want to know just not just what I Know but how much I care and the fact that I really want to hear\nWhat they're all about and I can't build a really we can't build a plan together and be successful in retirement unless we both ask those deep question and I'll say there should be no question that you don't feel comfortable asking your advisor\nWhen it comes to your hard earned money mhm keep going keep going\nSo so fill us we're talking about these these different types of questions I'll call and good questions versus bad questions that really it's the surface level questions\nVersus something that goes a little bit deeper when somebody asks you for example why do you do this why do you how long have you been doing this and why do you do this what story to tell them\nOh gosh yeah when I go into my why I think that people really see how genuine I Am about what I Do and how much it matters and what gets me up in the morning\nThere is and what gets me up in the morning because my why really came when when my mom became an instant widow at fifty nine years old my dad died instantly in a car accident and overnight she lost a love of her life I lost my dad and\nShe was also a stay at home mom and she lost her paycheck and you know wonderful\nWonderful wonderful parents are so blessed\nShe I was taking a hiatus from from the fight from what I was doing raising the kid she didn't want to burden me even though I had helped my dad's set up his retirement plans that saving for retirement right\nThanks for staying with us today on retire financially fit with Phyllis I'm generally jak alongside Phyllis ... she's founder and president at P. S. P. N. associates Phyllis is they fully licensed\nFiduciary adviser she is the author of the best selling book\nCreating calm and it's the storm and today we are going over the questions you need to be asking\nAs you have those conversations with your advisor that's you're having those retirement planning conversation did you get back into this if he hears something you'd like to get some answers on six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six is the number again six to three\nSeven nine two fifty four Ninety six\nFill us we talked about going beneath the surface level questions when you're talking to a financial advisor not just asking them how long have you been in the business but the why\nDo why as to why they love what they do and why they're passionate about helping their clients but what kinds of questions do you ask from the other side of the table how how do you go beyond the surface level questions with your clients\nSo initially our first meeting is is called the discovery meeting really really important to discover what's going on what are their goals can we bring value to them do they even you know\nWant our help with that but and and the way that we get there\nIs but I really delving in to their goals\nNot just the tools that they have the products that they have or the performance that they want but what are their\nDreams let's understand their dreams you know we're the couple in the last week for the discovery meeting\nMhm and and at\nOne point the lady said to me wow this is this is really interesting nobody's\nEver asked me about how I Want to travel what I Want to do there or or I Want to help with my grandchildren's education\nWhat does that really looked like huh so yeah I mean I I\nDo we still in so if you want to travel how do you want to travel how often do you want to travel where do you want to go why do you want to go there what is that how would you feel if if you couldn't do that for certain circumstances how do you feel about\nYourself when when you're done with that this couple with with the grandchildren's education is like\nWell do you want to buy them books each year do you really want to help them pay for it that's a big difference in your plan and so when the lady said to me nobody's ever done that I said\nI said I said well what have they done well usually you know if I make a statement I Want to plan for this will start talking about where I should put my money to accomplish that and I just kind of looked\nAt she and her husband and I said well so what you're telling me is it's all performance based what tool you should use whether you should use a stock\nOr a bond or or or real estate investment to accomplish that and and how much money you expect to make on that and she said yeah pretty much I said well\nLet's think about that\nIs it is it more important are you more protective of how well you do on that investment or how\nMuch you accomplish the goal is it more important\nThat you make that six or seven percent on your bottom this year or that you're able to write a check to help pay for your grandchildren's college ... we should we spend more time\nDid you just looked at me like yeah I looked at like ... right those are the type of questions we want to know the why just like I Want you to know the Y. about me\nAnd the fact that this is the area that I focus on I'm not everything to everybody I Can't double or triple your money I don't desire to do that but I can build a plan that will get you to and through retirement successfully if your realistic\nAnd you will share with me what your goals are what your dreams and communicate well with me we can do that together it's really important to understand all of that understand the goals first and foremost and you know really understand what each other\nMhm and that's why you need to ask the questions about ...\nIt questions about what is your area of expertise why do you do it how do you get back that up and on my side of the table I really need to understand you not just from the surface not just from a financial viewpoint I can get your five grand a month or whatever the case may be but\nFrom the viewpoint that this is why I Want to do it this is real important and we're going to make it happen\nSo I retire fit analysis is about first and foremost that observation meeting where we really delve deeper the things that you may not have thought about why you want to do what you're going to do what that's going to look like from a financial viewpoint\nOkay really take the time to understand that really giving you the opportunity to understand who you are what we do what our area of expertise is and then once we got a really good picture of flu each other is then we take where you're at\nFrom a financial viewpoint and we show you in dollars and cents how that really lines up with your objectives are there any gaps are there any holes in where you want to be maybe you're not going to have enough income five years from now because you don't have an inflation adjusted plan\nMaybe have more risk than you saw it and this tomorrow the market doesn't do what we expected it to do you're going to have less income or you're gonna have to sell off holdings that you're never going to get back in retirement\nWe'll show you that and black and white but\nThe first step is let's ask good questions to understand\nWhat you're trying to accomplish you ask the questions to understand if you even want me to begin to help you build that plant and solve that\nAnd so the retired fit analysis will do that for you if you've worked hard and you're close to retirement or you're in retirement you've done the heavy lifting you've saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement\nPick up the phone calls for retired fit analysis the number to do that is six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six again six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six you got to be one of the\nFirst ten calls to call us who saved at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more for retirement\nThere is no obligation absolutely not there is no cost to this but let's just have a great discovery conversation to see if it makes sense to help you with your issues if there are any\nThat number one more time six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six to reach Phyllis ... and the team that P. S. P. N. associates I'm generally jak alongside we've been talking about the right questions\nThat you should be asking as you are going to their retirement planning process and fill us our our main point has then we want to go beneath the surface level questions to get a better understanding of the advisor we're working with their background\nAnd from the advisors perspective they need to know what we're all about so they can help them figure out how to accomplish their goals but this isn't to say those surface level questions shouldn't be asked to I mean it we do need to ask questions such as what are the costs of these investments what are the fees we do need to ask those questions right\nAbsolutely absolutely first is there a connection is is some depth and substance to this person that you're potentially thinking about getting financially naked with or maybe working with but then yeah absolutely they can be great talkers\nThey could have great connections but if they're not forthcoming and trends parent and they don't want it educates you to lay everything else that you're the c._e._o. of your money there's something wrong with that\nToo so you absolutely need to to ask those surface questions if you will okay just just like you would\nNot go out and buy a car and not ask the cells person how much the carcass [laughter] and we laugh when we do that but I Can't tell you how many times people have a\nFinancial instrument and they really don't understand how much it's costing them ... and I'm going to say this to you I really think that it's incumbent upon the right financial professionals to volunteer\nThat to you mhm what you're going to be putting into that investment what it's going to be causing ... and lay it out for you rather than you having to ask but sometimes maybe maybe like me can you tell I get\nPassionate about thing you know\nI'm so excited about talking about other things that I may not get to that point knowing that I Will you know eventually so you want to stop\nIf it hasn't been answered and get an explanation of that because different investments have different costs associated with them so I think we should break down a couple of days\nYeah well yeah because I think a lot of us we we\nFees but we don't really know where they are how to find them\nYeah so this is a good rule of thumb no matter how you invest you're going to incur costs\nIf you use an advisor is going to be costs associated with that definitely some way some shape or form even if you use what we call the robo advisers this costs associated with that\nSo yeah we want to use should be breaking down and knowing those costs so that you can evaluate as an educated investor make a well informed decision whether you're getting enough thing for your buck ... and sometimes you know I'm never\nYeah that that could definitely be part of the issue\nAbsolutely not necessarily the whole issue but that definitely could be part of it so I'm just going to put this out there\nWhen you begin a relationship with somebody if if your current advisor has never given\nYou a fee analysis and they don't do it on an ongoing basis and they haven't broken down all the fees\nAnd surrender charges on your variable annuities are you're fixed annuities are your fix index annuities\nYou ought to be getting that oh you ought to be calling me for an analysis of all of that now I Want to also say this with\nHis the tricky part when it comes to investment is off the okay that that the advice that gets paid I get paid X. amount of one percent to\nWhatever it is then there's the internal cost but you see that come out of your money somehow some way if you really pay attention okay when it comes to insurance products whether it be annuities whether it be life insurance whether it be long term care insurance\nThe fee\nDoesn't come out it's not that duct it from the money that that you put in but it's paid ... out of the contract\nTo the advisor getting paid a commission you don't see that but we're getting paid to share okay I still really believe that we should be disclosing\nWant you to know\nThat that I Want to bring a ton of value and you get to decide whether you believe that that's true and here's how much I'm getting paid for this even though you're not going to see it the duct tape from your money I'm going to give you something written that says here's what our commission is on this because I I Believe over fiduciary and it's your decision if you don't think I brought\nYou enough value then you really shouldn't work with me it's your decision and I want to know that are up front if you don't feel that way and you should as well so\nWhether it's not coming out of your money or being the duct it or not\nYou should be someone should be forthcoming with every fee that's on the table\nAnd I don't want to I hopefully I won't be doing that after the fat but if you've already got investments and you haven't gotten to the report you don't have a statement that says here's what\nI made on your particular vehicle pick up the phone and calls for retirement\nAnd Alice is six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six\nLet's take another break we've got one more segments coming up on the other side final inside and some final questions from Phyllis coming up next [noise]\nWhen you're creating the retirements strategy and

T. dot com that is the website if you'd like to learn a little bit more or as we get into this last part of the show and you have questions you can reach Phyllis and her team by calling six\nTo three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six that number again is six to three seven nine two fifty four Ninety six\nTo fill us we've been talking extensively about some of these surface level questions you can ask because that can lead you to what's going on with some of this money slipping through the cracks and many times it's fees and costs things we didn't fully\nUnderstand but there are other areas where money can slip through the cracks where you can help identify what's going on a big one is taxes\nYeah let's just talk in general the shipping Nichols if you would dripping okay so how do you come to see when you come to check out financial professional for this stage of life you're transitioning into any time and his the things that\nReally you you need and should be looking for a few have an ongoing relationship his the pieces of the puzzle that you want to make sure that they're taking care of I Know I went through fees you shouldn't have a very full understanding of what those are\nAre you dripping Nichols and I mean are you paying fees in a way that's meaningful to you that you're getting the value do you know all the nickels that you're dripping so to speak\nRight so that's one piece when it when it comes to income do you have an income plan that you can touch and feel for it now\nTo many is down the road that's inflation adjusted so that you're not going to drip Nick Nichols by selling off stocks at a low if you need more income or bonds when they've lost\nValue okay so you needed income land that's one of the things that new advisor your existing advisor should be laying out without cash flow in retirement you don't have a retirement plan taxes oh my goodness here we go Gen hold on tonight because taxes are the red headed stepchild\nOkay just I Would say that Ninety percent of the people maybe Ninety five percent of the people that I meet today\nHave most of their money in retirement accounts account or they have and that they've put away the money before paying taxes on it\nThey are going to pay the taxes later on certainly at seven\nAnd a half Uncle Sam says you must start taking out to require minimum distribution you must start taking money from this account and you've got to pay taxes when that happens\nIf you do not have the tax strategy if you do not have\nA plan that takes into account how much you're going to be required to take out and how much Uncle Sam is going to be getting from you if you if you're married and you don't take into account how much more you're surviving spouse will have to pay in taxes and drip Nichols\nGive back to the government you do not have a retirement plan so in that very first meeting or even if you have an existing\nAdvise if there's not a forward looking act strategy that's coordinated with your investment strategy\nIf there is not something if you do if you're not being shown like the software that we have how much it's going to cost you in tax dollars on this retirement account you're dripping Nichols you're going to be backed into a corner more than likely people are settled it when I showed them\nHey here's the million bucks that you have I make the statement usually if someone comes in with a million dollars and they're proud of it I hate to be like this but you know this is not all your money ... going to take some\n... and they look at me like yeah OK book part of the retired fit analysis is based upon their age and their life expectancy and how much they have in that retirement account and what their tax bracket is and how much they expect to make on their investment\nWe do an actual factual verifiable analysis that shows them how much they're going to give up all that that was knows how much it's going to cost them and taxes I open\nIt I'm sure it is I opening because we hear taxes and we think oh I'm sure it's something but we don't realize\nYou don't realize just how big\nOf an impact it can have said is that pretty common huge yeah\nSometimes I show people that over the lifetime and the next generation when the money's left behind that they're going to lose over fifty percent now\nOf those I might outing but not everybody but we take their real numbers their tax\nBracket and we show them and we showed them with the numbers came from that putting you in charge that your advisors should be doing that because taxes in retirement you get to control where you take your money from when if you organize it right\nOkay big area where we see last opportunity and I'm going to scream about it I Can't help it\nWith the tax laws right now the taxes are lower for just about everybody a great planning opportunity to really strategize with your retirement accounts and take some of your money and moving from for ever tax to

it was nice I actually went archery all counting\nIt tried to kill an elk with the sticking a string it did you were you successful uh I I kind of thing so we're going back up to try to find the ... that that I did hear and and I'm doing everything I possibly can to find it All right cool but yeah so you want to hear the stories you know you worry about ready to go through 'em again or the money I have I have thought of\nHer for a whole day okay don't ask a\nFisherman or a hunter how they did\nIf they did good they'll tell you without asking if they're not volunteering that information chances are they didn't do good\nWe have some quality time with your son up there and and uh you you up he was up there were the last three or four days\nA ... yeah my son went up for three or four days I was up there for eleven or by eager or ... east yeah Greer eager sunrise area um you know what man there's\nThis is this is one thing and you know I came into your office and I was talking the Ashley tears in my eyes 'cause the last day of of elk season to come in and and I didn't get something and it in the last day was the next day and I'm like Doug I got to go back he's like what\nIn my wife even was even worse off her birthday well okay [laughter] drawn once every\nOr eight years Israel but it but there's something about getting out of the city something about leaving the rat race something about the simplicity of standing in the middle of the metal ... its son a set hearing even though I Can't stand the wolves hearing wolves going here in L. view willing\nJust something that stripped down to to to what we are truly about in our soul and we forget about all that\nIn consequential things that we deal with on a daily basis that are the most important things in our lives at the time oh my gosh you got to call this person back or we got to get this thing done sometimes you just got to get away\nYou know open and shut case\nYou're still going on then you still going to lie on the goodness gracious you you've got to go to court you can spend fifty two hundred thousand dollars just going through a trial and\nThat's and that's the way we wanted to have the option to go after a court court fees as well and lawyer for you\nSo how do you avoid all of this stuff I mean if somebody's out there because look at the Arizona California anyway what do you do you I mean\nThey came down quite substantially from a two hundred fifty thousand dollar asking the mediation but um you know we're we're holding tight to are are you know to our number which is zero [laughter] you know\nIt's it is what it is and it's not because you're trying to be stingy it's because you're if you're doing the right\nCompletely on the road all day on and do faulted at in any way and you don't have all your spending you know you you you did this fraudulently you do that was going on you knew that this was going to happen and\nIt's just all garbage as I see all weather patterns yeah as complete garbage and um you know they're they're working for their client and\nYou know sometimes you gotta you gotta just stick up for yourself and do the right thing\nTo probably could I walked away and said okay take twenty grand or something like that and and they probably would have taken it probably would have been cheaper in the long run that sometimes it's just principal\nAnd um you know they're they're basically this is\nLegalized ... the extortion and that's what it is yeah it is\nAnd and uh it's frustrating when you when you deal with something like this um you know and I've gotten a lot better at it when it's completely out of your control and completely frivolous and\nUm you know and you know it's just a money grab a for the lawyers and for the people that moved into that house they know they're in the wrong they knew what was wrong with that house and they didn't do anything about it and and ah\nAnd then for something to happen and then that you know nobody takes any self you know they don't blame themselves and has to be somebody else's fault and and um you know I I just it just drives me nuts sometimes ... personal responsibility there whatsoever\nMaybe there's no way to avoid this especially if you do enough houses or you're gonna run into a situation like this but what you very far but you've got to protect yourself\nExactly and that's what we did is you know we had the uh we had the agent that that protected us so you you know we we we've been in the business we've been around the block a couple of times so we knew what kind of urban to put in there\nUh we gave them what they asked for um you know obviously we'd never to know that they weren't going to fix the problems that we're we're out yeah that they're outlined by the inspector of which we didn't have any idea that that was the case it was a it was a trust that was\nUm it was cut that shouldn't have been cut that wasn't it wasn't something that we did it was something that somebody else did prior to us buying it\nAnd I'm In that trust needed to be fixed and they never fixed it and it's right there and the inspection for all the sea and they outlined it for it to be fixed and um and we were going to fix that and they said instead of doing that just give us seven grand and we did\nAnd uh and then that trust fail and you know they're still now that's our fault I guess and by the way it was six seven months after they closed on it so\nIt's just frustrating I'm dealing with with people that are not reasonable and I'm In er aren't and don't take any personal responsibility in it are you this business is so great in so many ways and I owe my you know everything financially to real estate and and um I met some wonderful people doing it and\nBut you know what these these experiences are so interesting to me you know going through that process of mediation and and being in the room and having this a as a judge going back and forth and trying to mediate it and and trying to get two people that are completely opposed to it's like I'm having a Democrat and Republican\nWho has tried to get the degree here trying to one side the Trump king and the other side they Hillary ...\nAnd that's what they do is cause they coming to you and they go well you know there's a chance at the other side could way and you might want to consider that bad yeah and then they go to the other side you know like you know you're asking for quite a bit you got a pretty weak case here\nIt's a that's exactly what they do go back and forth back and forth and and uh you know we did five hours they wanted to do eight hours and I'm like why would\nThey know versus five hours\nIn the eyes it's it's ah there's no way to get costs and the other four grand or for the for the uh the mediator\nYeah right there five hundred bucks an hour beat the mediator assistance saying that's what the aid and they're retired judges man they make bank doing that\nAs they do yes they do they have a whole building in LA for it man yeah the it's the resolution building I'd been there so I I flew out uh on Thursday morning you flew back or Thursday Afternoon a complete waste of five hours a day\nIt's a five hours a day [laughter]\nSo the the take away from this whole thing is I use the license contractor if you're doing work on a house yeah\nI mean because if we didn't use elections contact contract or we would have been in trouble for the the the things that were already done see what they did is they they try to pick apart other other things surely know if this was all done by license guns\nAnd ultimately if you were found liable for some of that then you can go after the license contractor and that's why their license and insured and beyond\nThat's why you have to use them and it is in Arizona you have to use any in a lot of people don't do this if you do over a thousand dollars worth of work and and you're going to sell the house you have to use a license contractor if not you could be open yourself to a lot of life\nYou can always check with the register contractors just Google that and they got a whole list everybody is you're interviewing and you can find that

even named myself after [laughter]\nYou know it's nice we had a a great we went over our numbers are met met earlier this week and went over and numbers and we had a really good September you know we bought a bunch of houses you know twenty plus houses in the month of September from the public and\nUm you know it's it's nice to be able to compete against the big boys and ah 'cause we're a little different than they are you know how we differ well they're they're I buyers or you know it was what\nThey I ... that's what they've been Internet buyers that\nBuyers yep and uh and we actually uh we go out and giving people options and we give them the two are true number right there on the spot do we do we're all in one of the inspection right there we can\nWe can do it or we can buy it directly from them we can do the listing give it over to doing uh we can refer 'em through our property management company there's so many different avenues to do and again I've I've talked about this other show quick quoted a numerous times as\nYou know ... every person has different every ... every person is these are different and it's just nice to be able to sit down and have a um an open and honest conversation and uh try to figure out the best pass a to to make their uh you know to figure out there\nWith the gold owners needs and wants yeah so so basically in case somebody who's just listening for the first time and David they're wondering what what is the difference between a duck Hopkins or the big institutional buyers that you hear the uh offer door in open\nPat I think I like to say I might see trust me brother I'm going to flip it up in any way to help out a bit but a lot of other ones\nIs is the other big big money coming in the space and um and there's a reason for it you know and a ... you know it's it's it's crazy 'cause it seems like there's always there's you know it's kind of like um uh what was the name of the the the two radio uh Internet radio companies in ... that came\nAnd Pandora oils area since ... serious next satellite\nAnd it it seems like you know there there's not enough room in the space when you have that much money that needs to go out um without you know eating each other up\nYeah I have a feeling that uh you're going to see a bird sheer ah with with one a couple of not several those companies and then maybe we'll buy and there'll be one one yeah there you go there'll be one minute do I make more money than they do\nActually believe it or not that's the truth and the reason\nWhy let me get to the point that I was trying to make here uh when the average person who's listening right now if you want to submit your house on line I to one of these big companies you're going to hit an algorithm not to humans can touch it\nAnd it's going to go through and it's going to say hey look up this address see what the value is march twenty percent off after ten percent off it I'd send them back a number that's going to be pretty pleasing when you see it the first time\nThe problem is is it then you have the fees then you had the inspections then you have the repairs and those numbers get taken off\nAfter you've signed the contract\nWhere it's different with duck Hopkins dot com as you go to duck Hopkins dot com you submit your property there's a human their values your house you're going to be on the phone with human right away and the human is going to come to your house within a day or two depending on what your schedule is and they look at the house and you can say okay\nHere's what needs to be fixed here's where our numbers are and then you negotiate with the human\nAnd you're done when you do it through\nWhen you do it through the computer it could take three days a week or two weeks a month before you even get to the final number that you know you're going to get that's not the way the duck Hopkins says\nBut all all for what to be stressed out every quarter and still uncertain on whether or not you're doing the right\nPeople hire you for an expertise scale and nearly ... people who have skills in the areas that you don't and unless you have the training attacks professional needs to be the one managing your

with us in Los Angeles time a gene how are you\nAre you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm south just give you a different background I finish off me [laughter] so um I graduated high school a few years ago and I decided to go to community college and logging community college um I work I went to a\nWork [laughter] um I did about like thirty hours a week for the community college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I'm In my first semester it right now I'm In classes are just um you know it's a little bit harder\nSo my question was do you think I should quit my job and focus more on school for the last two years do you\nThink I should just I'm just trying harder and a dj Cooper mhm what are you studying accounting\nOkay I've got a finance degree and I worked forty to sixty hours a week\nWhile I went through school and for years and at the university level ... um uh it's doable\nUm you are you know you are doing a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure\nUh um the um how are you paying for school\nUm I go to I get grants and also um ... the money for\nOkay so you're you're not going into debt\nNo level of okay\nSo if you quit work how would you pay for school\nI have some money saved up from a working for the past year I don't think I think it will probably like call of mhm oh you left me a year year and a half no I think I keep working okay\nIf it clearly last year if it costs you a half a point when your grade point average um\nYeah I heard about it like cheap yeah yeah I graduated with a two non seven I missed it as magnetic by I'm just making about three one ... still piss Thirty years later but [laughter]\nBut you know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before they asked my advice [laughter]\nAnd I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life ever in if you're willing to go to work for one of the top accounting firms in the entire world\nThey might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter on your very first job but after that it won't um\nAnd it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kinda stuff and so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good\nOkay poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them might actually be a four year degree\nYeah that's what I was thinking too\nYou know it wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if you can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool on top of it but I'm I'm you know you're not working a hundred hours a week working thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this\nIt's very doable uh most people work when they're in school it's not that unusual really by the way uh when I when I Do and I was in\nI was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing an event we sit right of course all going to ask the audience were three thousand people there how many of your work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand now maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but\nIt appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nI Am doing well thank you for asking and I hope I get tacos here and my husband and I weigh in baby steps you getting at it that Ali ... called ... and make them for a down payment on our ... ... adults that we're looking right now at about a\nGreat thing about them I call frequent down um our house and Capitol for\nUm sonics back when he was about one class size and after about negative cycle cap one thirty two so I'm trying to make sure that I like them about like how much how by and that we are understanding the al ...\n[noise] I I I think you recommend and I forgot your take home pay\nIf your take home pay exactly at okay perfect and thought I wanted to make sure that like right now we're paper million markets calculated and right now we're kind of a funny one from Jerry I'm One of\n'em and come up like a reasonable comfortable amount house on a fair number I guess have little or no answers but now\nIt's a lot better when you're paying now but if that's ... that's ... a fourth of your take on pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the mouth spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most\nYou should do so you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put on a shorter term if you want to and\nYou know I'm about less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong report on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all\nFor anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay\nLuke is with us in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show\n[noise] I'd have area better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo um my wife and I have a very real to you for many years actually my dad got me actually when I was a young kid and um stupidly I did not take your bike and I had to download and we are considering taking a cash out refinanced her house\nTo knock out the high interest you know ... and then start paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much they want to share my student loan debt that you know she read at forty eight thousand drank and what's your household income [noise]\nActually Twain takeover forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring a culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance\nActually take care of to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither ... show on now I I've never told anybody do that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years um you're going to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life but then you're going to be debt free except your house\nAnd then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be groups but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nWe're going to go in and also fast there's luck you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is about forty eight thousand for two years more twenty thousand for two years but goes halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful very dolled in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can all your business to increase your income because you need to clean up the student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of debt and worked in your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron ec statement that we all make which I'm digging a hole you're not digging out I Hope you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper\nDig out of all you have to fill in the hall I get to climb out of the whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China and work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that\nAnd that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nBut on the sand and say well now borrowing money\nEver ever ever ever\nDishes that I Ramsey show [noise]\nGet a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the ...\nSmart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of and\nBecause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much debt everybody had\nAnd were like wow like you know there's a support group and you know this was a great way let's start with the baby steps ... and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter bizarro intensity and it really helps how much\nUh we had about ten thousand and so\nThat was hard for a nerd was it was a checkout clean other sort of an officer takes your breath away so Veronica spend or go to class you go to class but then you get in there and there has to be a moment where you go oh sure I like fish\nIt wasn't so much\nThat I didn't like it I just I felt like\nI needed like I said strategies to help me 'cause I I didn't want to be in that either and I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway ban where you went oh I see that now\nEverything about it was awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles\nAnd and within the same thing or that he is and then me and just coming to my senses and saying you know is this is this material things something that I really need to have\nUsing the ... the ... system really helped me\nAnd I'm not felt our budget and this is the amount of money we need to pay for our groceries and says you know this is how much we we can get to the church and this is how much we can give people for gifts and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those steps I you know we're just\nLike the sound a little bit like ritual Richard ... is that a budget is permission to spend I Love your daughter permission to spend okay yeah\nYeah and that's exactly what it is I I there is sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money that's the mindset I had to get myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we wanted it ... you know when I'm In control and budget\nBut once I set about what a control me I don't know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader when your brother was a cheerleader and you had the community that you got plugged into richer leaders who else would your biggest cheerleader\nAnd uh I mean we're really close to our family and my family through\nAll of them are very supportive of us when we come from five brothers\nNot five riders\nFive kids from each family so two brothers and sisters so we have we come from a big family but and they were all supportive of us really and our friends and as\nWell so so what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ...\nYou know communication is key and you know we went to the money and marriage last week and we were listening to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial piece for they've gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I think if they had gone through the seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page\nAnd it would just really explode once I get through that anymore and follow the ... the steps yeah\nAnd just you know writing down articles was really important for us to do and once we had that you know we're very cool driven um especially being in sales you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and said just staying focused and dedicated and disciplined\nI'm really really helped us\nWell don't you guys from Bert proud of you very well to a neutron couple a lesson right towards the marriage money thing or it's but virtually stand up comedy 'cause they're both a book about a ... yeah they really are funny

I Try to be as respectful as I can I Do not understand\nI Can't listen to you because you voted for Obama or I Can't even talk to you because you voted for Donald Trump\nThere are certain people in my own family and I've had to quote unquote take a break from because they've gotten so strident and so anti fill in the blank\nThen I'm like you're ... I Can't even have a decent conversation because it always comes back to hey gee here with that guy David ... you know what happened there you know what that's about right\nCan I just enjoy a little time with you and talk about the holidays instead of hearing a lecture about George W. Bush or the sorrows campaign or Donald Trump or whatever I don't care\nThat's why I had to support my family up what two years ago during the election everybody\nJoke but I was serious we had read tables and blue tables if you're a Trump supporter you go to the red table and you sit with other ... you write and want to get in knowing if you're a blue table you like Hillary go sit with other blue people go ahead and do it and I was going to have any of it and that and that's exactly what took place I just think that that in this day and age you can't get away from it now\nUm will give you a couple of examples you can't get away from the politics\nHow about television\nWell I mean if you watch a football game are you wondering if people were kneeling or if you watch Roseanne are you are you watching a pro Trump show if\nYou're watching late night TV arguing cable anti Trump right you know tirades from Steven cold there\nOr how about how about social media well obviously you can't get away from it but that's the number one number one where people go and just put you in anything that happens in America a school shooting boom it's politicized let's not talk about the dead kids let's talk about who's right the Republicans the Democrats on gun control\nI mean if you if you go to hurricanes hurricanes are now I Know ... whether ... whether ... yeah uh there's a movie that's coming out first man did you see this that's with Ryan Gosling about the moon yes so into the moon and uh apparently in this movie Neil Armstrong new orange\nHe'll Armstrong Neil Armstrong they don't show\nThe the astronaut planting the American flag on the moon because whoever created is this you know this film said that's not the important part\nWell I Would say yes it is the important part it was a race to get to the moon but certain people didn't want to politicize it or they didn't want to say we don't want to point to ourselves that we're American right because we don't feel like\nWell we feel like American like nobody likes to say nobody likes to take over the last anymore right\nSo a lot like what Megan said play it again but I don't think either sorry\nThat my great as they are very much when it comes to politics in a world where we are all sister there yet boarding H I accept that and\nSo if they if the if the women that have you can sit there and no they don't agree on anything\nBut they all will come back together and are all Fran right on the right at the end of the day America can't do that any not figured out how to do that right and I don't think it's going to
