Ben Hanson fact or fake he's straight ahead ... [noise]\n\n... [noise]\nAre you fifth year older okay well I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand so don't worry but I Do want to ask you have you signed up for a Mac yet if your answer is no why it's a free membership for one year you don't even have to give them credit card information\nI Can't ... there's some there's something going on here that I can explain that science isn't going to be able to explain and there's some weird stuff\nYeah I Would say you know when we first started the show there were probably about um gosh I don't know about half of them that we couldn't explain and then we kinda got better skills and I'd\nSay there was still a third you know in the second third season there was probably about a third that we came up with with\nJust because you can explain let's say how video could have been made or hoax didn't mean that um\nThat it was so we'd go and and if we felt like unsatisfied we still do a a paranormal investigator ... and we saw some some really amazing things because some UFOs I'm On film that I think are some of the best ever caught on film\nUm we I watched in the ghosts investigations objects flying across the room\nYou know object manipulation things that we caught on tape um uh we had a like with the the crypt those who are Jekyll stuff one of the most famous cases we had was actually it was up near Fresno\nAnd if you Google hum a factor fake night crawl or you'll see a pair of pants it looks like\nA just a parents walking across somebody's lawn and it was one of those really eerie videos that went viral and to this day I still don't know it it either had to be CGI or this homeowner was in on this hoax which is not likely\nConsidering his background and so um yeah there's a lot of things that we were just have to kind of putting that box of well I Can't explain this one at all and uh it's pretty cool and you know if you do do that\nDoes it make you look at the world in a different place do you think goes in and and UFOs and things like that are you more open\nBecause the way I've always looked at it we we are skeptical by nature right like if if somebody post something on Facebook about how their kid had nobody at their party and that just happened to you know out here a couple of weeks ago and then everybody's like oh and I'm like well wait a minute here the first thing is\nMore skeptical and we're like add the mom wants something she wants to free goodies\nAre and that that's why she's doing it and and a lot of people go into things I think if you're not open minded enough to put it in and and you find a way to do everything she got to be open mindedness is situation like this and have you seen people who are skeptics who are like\nI Can't really explain that so I'm not a skeptical about that because I can get why people you know every star in the ... you know that's a UFO that's UFO that's it goes you can explain a lotta that way but\nFirst skeptics they try to explain everything away\nYeah absolutely and and technology is kind of a double edged sword because you know YouTube and a photos video social media\nWhat what we have is like this great vehicle to be able to show this to the world but it's also a much easier to fake it now\nAnd so I don't blame people for looking at something and automatically thinking was fake but at the same time if we do come up with the smoking gun let's say you know a a UFO lands on the White House lawn\nHow are we going to be able to tell the world that story because we don't trust or media anymore and we don't trust you know people are on YouTube\nSo how many people are still going to believe that didn't happen you know so\nIt it's seeing is not really believing I think I think it's going to take some major incidents where a lot of people your friend down the street or you are going to see things in the sky and say\nOkay well this is a real a real phenomenon and now we need to study it\nAbsolutely song in advance\nSky and say okay well this is a real a real phenomenon and now we need to study it\nAbsolutely talking to been answered from a fact or faked a paranormal files in the ... dot com that's with an e ha and at the end\nSo not part of the Hanson Brothers everybody your role show what's the scariest thing you've had have done a few of these were you like you know what\nI'm ... ah yeah that was a that that that made me uncomfortable that was that was crazy that was creepy in in in and it made you really ...\n[laughter] um well I've been a you know touched before by things I couldn't see I've had audible voice has spoken into my ear sentences\nOr I was actually off the show I was um I was giving a lecture at the\nUm UFO museum and Roswell New Mexico interesting and the feeder supposedly was haunted and they said hey you want to come check it out so when we're done lecturing upstairs and we were setting up equipment and I was facing the rest of the group who didn't see behind them I was looking at them\nAnd I watched the dark shadow I'm with a quote\nJust you know casually walk across the hallway and walk right through the wall and um that was kind of the first and only time I've seen a full operation like that but you know with with everything that happens you just kind of put that in your box like okay you know I've seen that I've done that\nYou know and so now what what what else could happen and uh yeah I it it it's pretty crazy because you do this enough you you probably will see just about everything\nThat's that's the cool thing in UFOs you're talking about UFOs what's the UFO thing where you're like I Can't I Can't explain that nobody else can explain that no matter how hard we look at any you think what's the one thing where you are like this this is we're not alone\nWell I've ... my ... I have had three sightings now excuse me and uh probably my favorite was actually where I live here in Huntington Beach California and and I went for a jog with my wife and it was it was dark or we went up so high school track\nAnd um I had finished running so I was sitting there on the lawn\nAnd the middle of the track looking up at the sky stretching and I'm suddenly this this um triangular craft and it had three white points of light completely silent it just came cruising over our heads about I'm a thousand feet\nAnd um she came around the track and I looked at her and I I was hoping that she thought I said I think I saw it she says a UFO like to the craziest thing though was that um\nI felt like I was drinking the cooler because a lot of people describe these triangular black UFOs I'm not only is being silent but also having some sort of like cloaking earned visibility to them and I was like\nWell what I saw was the paint or the inside of a triangle is exactly the same as the sky above\nSo I could see an edge but otherwise it looked like it was just three white lights and when it flies over you and it's it's completely silent\nI'm cruising as it did several hundred miles an hour to me if it's ours uh it's pretty cool stuff you know because\nIt's not conventional and it's not anything that our military you know who's even hinted at having so why would you fight over populated areas well you know all these questions and um you can't just discount after that it you know other people's stories\nThat's crazy it's crazy been asked to name a fact or fake was the uh what do you know what's going on your world ah right now\nWell you know the the paranormal subject is is really hot again on TV a couple of networks\nAre buying lots of shows so I'm I'm really close to getting another show going hair cat named the network yet but um I Do that for the for the most part is a hobby and just kind of a kind of dabble in that\nBut I'm always always are doing public investigations and um I just came off of a paranormal cruise [laughter] so anything out there you go that are involved that it's it's a lot of fun but\nOn my man for coming on today and uh uh go enjoy your Halloween and maybe it will be a scared a little bit later thanks so much for spending time with us today\nAll right thanks at\nThinking that she had been to chose your Twitter ...
