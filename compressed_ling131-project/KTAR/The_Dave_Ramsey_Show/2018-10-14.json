A. as it's sometimes referred to back from his recent trip to a small village in Japan\nWhere people maintain high levels of EJ and are famous for their ability to defy the aging process bill welcome to the program\nGreat to be with your pet and all your statements to introduce the show today are certainly not overstatements after years of people using oral highly ironic acid supplements well of course we're going to give your audience a report today an update\nAnd an improvement how things are going as thousands of people have discovered how this support\nIn particular their joints but also their skin and their eyes and of course their hair and so on these are the areas where the body actually is highly concentrated in ha\nBut I Want to tell all your listeners to please stay tuned to because there's going to be an F. R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached\nThis is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key the visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about it what is what exactly is this molecule you're talking about\nHad it's amazing that most people don't know this word high ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that a little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies\nWe have what we call baby fat it's really baby H ... it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice they never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it\nAnd to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible Joyce they can get in a kind of\nOh yes they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal to make more ha now women have more ha to lose the men do\nAnd you see this skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray all he's doing is measuring the space\nBetween the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we started getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule us all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nSix million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and purity found a way to knock it down\nSo that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means\nThat you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted as a laboratory right there in Florida\nAnd we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternatives or their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou just do we're talking with Bill ... acid or each you know bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why ... such a breakthrough in what exactly can you do for people\nThink the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself item in the mix college\nBut within that college and there's some moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time and that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule AJ\nThe body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this the connective tissue that connects all of our cells that connect all of everything that we have begins to lose its water it separates out and then we begin to lose\nThe substance the scaffolding ... the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting to wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nWe we see the the brain a shriveled up in the eye and so on all of these things occur with age and you know ... daily on was looking for a youth molecule and he wanted to find it and\nOf course the fountain of youth the water he was looking for a water fountain the body needs water but it has to hold it\nAnd of course I Want everyone to think\nOf having something like\nA jello a type of a water balloons filled with jello or one filled with water which one do you want you want the one filled with jello\nWith jello because it's still from but soft cushioning and that's the way our bodies are when we're young babies\nOr even a pregnant woman is loaded with this which is an example of how the ha is made more so at certain times of our life but as age goes on we're going to lose that we're going to see the wrinkles the thinning hair\nWe're going to see our joints lose their flexibility we're just telling people that after thousands of people have tried this if you're taking ... supplement it took Thirteen Years\nFor doctors to adopt glue costs ... sulfate it's a regular dietary supplement noun drugstores health food stores\nAny way here's Brent writing says no one that purity products made an outlandish claim about ha joined formula but three days after I started taking it I notice the

[noise]\nWelcome back to think America I'm chairing Gilbert with my two American Terry's donors here on our town hall radio town hall you're on think America are switching\nGears now on you to I don't know if you guys saw this or not but there's a video of a man with a dog\nWho was able to show parents at a public park that despite a lot of effort to teach kids about stranger danger the man his name is Joey but he plays the role of a stranger and telling her parents as such he says parents I can get your kids on the playground on that jungle gym\nTo talk to me and I'm going to do it by way of luring them with my ... which is a little dog\n[noise] and so the parents have not my kid right not like in my kid knows about stranger danger and he says just watch so he goes over he engages in Congress station with children coming down the slide or playing in the sand box whatever\nAnd not only do they engage but Joey walks off the playground with the kid to show it was a kid that there are other puppies\nThat are at the park and the parents are rather astonished with this so here's the question Scott let me start with you you are um you've heard the stranger danger advice do you believe that this is effective\nI Do however when I saw this and then I read some other articles for and against stranger danger teachings in what have you [laughter] I came to understand that I naturally\nHelp my children overcome the negative effects of stranger danger such as oh my gosh I'm scared of everything now ah I simply taught stranger danger however it's more stranger be aware\nYou know keep your distance if they want you to come with him don't come with them if they try to get too close separate yourself or back away I'm now this video is done at a park\nAnd that's the kind of setting where\nI taught my kids how to handle the setting appropriately um I also didn't ignore my children's show of a stranger and it started talking to them I found my way over there real quick so part of its parenting part of it is teaching your kids how to be a healthy functioning member of society uh when\nWe talk about kids and you are a parent yourself but we haven't addressed he at\nThe ages of children when I saw this and every single time I've thought about parents a stranger danger with regard to parents I always kind of thought it sounds good for young kids but for young child\nEvery person has kind of a stranger when they started going to go out and society a three year old doesn't really know the mailman and it was a benign jovial guy\nFrom somebody who wouldn't be I kinda think to a stranger danger should go for a lot of teenage girls\nYou know don't be Donnie ... and talking to someone at a bar if you're coming into a situation where you're using that fake ID right which he shouldn't have in other words should that stranger danger before really little chance any ways a\nDebt it let me go to you on that ... it depends on the age of the child as a kid is three\nI everybody sort of a strange\nRather than mom and dad yeah I told my kids are still got to living at home and said when they were really young and they weren't out on my side anyway that was never a problem\nUh but the older one and now the ... gene uh the cameras just using it and it's been a long known that if you want to get a kid\n... where you say hey I've got a free puppy over here on my car one to go go give the one that's been known for many many years when I taught the younger ones that I didn't have to teach them because I was there with them I never let them out of my state when they were younger now the older ones do more to tone anybody ever\nAsked you to go with them don't share word run as fast as you can to the nearest ocean bang on the door and somebody will\nBut when they understand that if they're three or four or even five\nI wouldn't live to be on them I say long enough to have that happened that was always fairly close to them at the park anywhere\nRight wing Dick irrespective of that do you really think this message\nStranger danger shouldn't be directed to kids who are older\nOr younger because of a lot of weird stuff going on I'm seeing a lot of strange people around my neighborhood\nUh and I just tell them look if you don't know the person you want to talk to your ... I couldn't find what if they make any ... were they shake come with me I got something to show you take off as fast as you can run\nA right and I think most parents in today's where most that I Know that when the kids are little of course they don't take their eyeballs awesome oftentimes they're very very close\nBy I is this God there's another angle on this I Want to cover\nEvery single\nLaw enforcement statistic that I read a psychologist that I read they talk about this other angles that these abductions are most likely\nTo happen with somebody that the kid actually knows the weird uncle distant aunt or the next door neighbor the pervert that lives down the street but you don't know he's a pervert so there's this element of this the stranger\nAdjective earned strange is stranger call now rather isn't a stranger it and he or she is in a stranger and all is someone that child no\nYes and that's where you know I I really think and I've always taken this approach is to simply teaching children and even ... teenagers and young adults to be\nThe old to be aware to be aware of what's going on around them to be aware of people's body language facial expressions how they're acting and to also know how to create a scene if they're trying to take you or to get away if you\nChinese language and from from that perspective I can hear the\nFrustration the anger the hurt actually a lot of people feel hurt when they think about what foreign countries have done to them now\nIs the exaggerated for political purposes inside of China I ... as I said this card is played it's taught it's taught to children from the time they're very very young it doesn't make it any less real that it's it\nBut we've we've tried to amend the pain the hurt the wound for example so many Chinese students coming to the U.S for schooling um for example\nIs setting up more and more trying to shut up more and more trade 'em\nIn ... where we're at right now is that we complain about stealing them stealing our technology\nAnd then selling it back to us and other nations plus we got this other issue that this computer chip issue that was heading into a mother warn of computers that this story just rogue recently it was getting into the mother board of computers into a cloud vendor into R D O D\nOur department of defense and maybe even the CIA and the\nOrganization that broke the story was Bloomberg they stand by this story she'll address how\nHow does the United states for one country tried to men this wrong and then they come back with another irrigation\n[noise] absolutely [noise] and uh I don't mean to make too much in the wound because I think it's time for China wants to be a mature\nUh international player we talked about that in a minute maybe a and so you know they need to be able to uh take things on the chin instead of always having a chip on the shoulder [noise] and um you know it's it's time that China\nAnd I'm when I talk about China I'm not talking about the Chinese people I'm Talking about the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist party because\nWhere the the the issues lye I'm\nMost became chip on the shoulder we're down to about a minute and a half so pleased address this latest story on the computer chip that she had an end to the mother boards\nI don't have personal knowledge of this other than the story that broke in the news uh let me put it to you this way having worked in the telecoms an IT business in China with hundreds of Chinese engineers as colleagues and also as\nDirect reports to me over off and on over the last twenty five years it really surprised me it wouldn't surprise me but I Know direct groups that it's true\nOkay in the last minute that we have a please address whether or not our president who has no deadline on the tariffs he's going to hold out can China hold out China is desperate\nAt this point although they won't obviously openly admit it I don't think that the president has a deadline and I think that Donald Trump and his administration are negotiating magnificently with the Chinese government and not having a deadline which is a mistake that a lot of foreign companies\nAnd countries have made in the past is a perfect negotiating position with which to go forward\nMoney we need to leave it there you're a wonderful interview I'll ask you back you can find homework at as a

article that came out of Houston Houston space to this issue about sex doll raw souls\nOpening up in their city city inspectors found one business that at a sex doll brothel set to open and how did they find this out\nCode enforcement officers found showers being installed electrical wiring and other fixtures renovations and what they thought was just\nA mercantile business selling sex y'all\nBut all of a sudden now there was room was there was wiring there were showers I was starting to look more like a little mini hotel or motel\nTurns out it was meant to be a sex robot bras all\nAlong the way when city inspectors were surprising what was going on with all this rental ... and they thought maybe it would be a strip club but it was that and then the mayor and other opponents found them to fight a brothel ducks robot brothel opening up in Houston in recent days in\nDoubt it got to a city council it got voted down but the bottom line Scott is that the city's position is that a sex robot can in fact be sold as a business\nBut you cannot use one there to put it politely for the air your response [laughter]\nWell I I I see a whole lot of NGOs to it but it and I'm not in the market for sex don't mind you but just thoughts from seeing this if I'm In the market for insects all\nDo I want to roll the dice and have somebody potentially have tried this

don't I don't get it [laughter]\nWell to Scott's point they talk about showers\nAbout showers well I imagine someone that would be playing around with affects all then would want to use a shower but

South Carolina soon we'll be in Washington that some of the time they say yes a Wisconsin and then we'll be taking a road trip across as far as Pennsylvania and West Virginia so\nThere'll be caught up in Minnesota was in the mix that's already Minnesota Minnesota Minnesota's I'm very much in the mix we think is going to be an exotic places to go\nYeah interesting interesting selection the logic specific logical those I I think they're great at it you know a fair apart picked four or five states those are those are pretty good ones\nYes well we realized when we looked at things that America is an incredibly diverse country it's not a ...\nAnd uh and so we had to work out where we can go in a short period of time five weeks which best reflected the various characters of of America\nSo Arizona obviously very important because of its proximity to Mexico and and issues that we can discuss it or South Carolina because it's in the south and they have their own a raft of issues by historical\nAnd contemporary we are still fighting the civil war most people forget that or didn't know don't recognize it but it was still there\nWill bear that I'm On on you know they are and that and of course Minnesota being in the ... uh and and the state which I think we're going to see a lot of ah a lot of contest in\n... and then by the way I just interject in that one that was a state most people didn't notice when Trump carried the upper Midwest it did not include Minnesota but he only missed by half a point so it's very much a swing state\nYeah so ... you'll be in there fighting and then of course a way very interested in ... in the mid west and moving across to I guess what you Michael a rust belt states where are the Democrats did so poorly in the last presidential campaign particularly Pennsylvania\nUh and I think if we do that\nWe'll get a good sense of ... of where Americans are to die we're not really interested in what's happening in LA well not really concerned about a New York we know what's gonna happen there but we do want to know what's happening in the south a very important parts of America the destroying the audiences see\nVery little ... even less about well\nOur our ... heard about this enterprise or one of the things I first thought I was in the early Nineteen century uh Alexis\nDe Tocqueville came to America this French guy wrote what for about two centuries was considered\nThe definitive work on American culture in American politics\nAnd uh most people feel that you had to not be an American in order to do that you have to be from the outside\nTo recognize things that within a country you might take as a given so given that background in and high bar or what have you been to southern Arizona you been to the border bend it to send come up here any impressions so far that hold\nWell we are very\nInterested in the wall because if you ask any astray probably any international observe out you know what was the first thing that you who to bat when you saw Donald Trump in two thousand and Fifteen to that\nExactly that's the issue is possible if you draw district lines if you have free play I'm drawing district laws that you can if you were a minority party you can district the steak\nIn a way that gives you a majority in the state legislature and if you're a slight majority party you can read district in a way that gives you a big majority\nBy packing your opponents into districts are so that they have less districts where they have they have any chance of winning a and you give them some safe districts but is in return for that\nYou take a lot of districts that are fairly closely divided um everybody does that to some extent\nAnd it's become a national scandal\nBecause for example if you take the house of representatives so last couple of elections a significantly greater number of people who voted for democratic candidates the Republican candidates for the house of representatives in both the last two were actual actions\nAnd yet in both the Republicans had significant majorities in the house of representatives how did that happen it happens because of gerrymandering\nAnd the case that it was before the court last year was from Wisconsin where there was proof really impressive jury man Republicans said gone from a slight minority party in a in some of that has the legislature to a fairly good majority\nAnd that was clear that that it happened and so it was thought to be a fairly strong case and that's why everybody who was one thing the court to set some rules here was hoping it happened last year\nAnd now the Kennedy is retired uh there's nobody shouldn't say this over the four liberals would like to I think a stylish constitutional rules\nAbout how much political gerrymandering is too much but now with his cabinet or should\nBe confirmed that will be five people who\nDo interest I think one of the things and we just a minute we're on their way out here and ...

I'm sure you've got the bill of rights in in in ended originally applied only to the federal government the fourteenth amendment is put in and one after the other ... the courts are decided he had that means that applies to the states is there any logic got all\nAs to why uh any distinction should be made it if if the fourteenth amendment extends constitutional rights uh to the state to state level issues on some things he's in the larger the same that it should apply to all\nOf a few it depends on how you think about it if if the issue is just hey as a right to free speech if as a federal right to free speech why shouldn't have stayed right to free speech be the same it seemed pretty clear that you would just incorporated\nA the same but the judges have said over the years\nThat that's too simplistic that there might be reasons why the federal protection of free speech might be more extensive are less expensive\nThan the state protection of free speech the best example of why that might be true I think is in the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule uh the ... they're mostly the discipline and regulate police\nThat you exclude the evidence that they illegally sees in order to try to get them not to a lethal he sees Evan is\nHow ... how much you want to do that I think probably could will depend upon whether the local police are sensitive to the Fourth Amendment or not if you're a local police off as a as a local police group that never violates\nOr the Fourth Amendment only occasionally will there be an unconstitutional search\nAnd then you get a case where is really important crime and illegally see evidence and it shows the guy's guilty you might say gee we don't need to discipline art police or because they they don't generally violate the rules and so why let this\nCriminal go free because of the police mistake whereas if you're in a jurisdiction where the police\nTend to ignore the Fourth Amendment then you might want to have a much more of a an exclusion rule is much stronger and more protective so that's the kind of constitutional right which you might make sense to interpret differently from state to state\nAnd that's the argument against it automatic incorporation of everything\nOf course no jurisdiction is going to freely admitted their police departments are actually violators um uh\nWell I I think some courts will and of course you ought to be sensitive to that and of course a state Supreme\nCourt sees a home run of cases of of charges that the police violated the law and they get a good sense of whether the police of obeying the constitution and not and that might very well think gee we need to do something about it or they might think hey this is not a problem here so widely guilty people go free because\nIf people go free because one police officers that something wrong\nOkay we will we will conclude in just a moment when we return with Paul ... talking all the Supreme Court hearing the thinking\n\nHey Arizona

keeps talking about my past Emily Ryan she's a political consulting with copper state consulting group right here in the valley Emily how are you today\nI'm doing great how are you\nGood so David Garcia is down by double digits in the latest poll is there any way you can come back and win\nAbsolutely not I I think the race is over you know in its early ballots go out tomorrow the early ... the race has already overdo the one most\nReally so no no chips whatsoever you can't do anything to do to kind of get the numbers back to single digits or you're going to try to waive yeah yeah do you even trust the polls though\nWell you know we learned a powerful lesson about how Ron Paul can be and turning sixteen than the way\nThat you know more than just the ... are really poorly run campaign like our CIA camp and as we get closer to election day believed that Governor in DC is actually growing which in the wrong trench from Garcia and it would take an October surprise and by that\nI mean a really bad shocking that have news about governor do see and the money to tell that story for Garcia to pull him down in numbers and make any ground and I don't see it happening\nI don't see it happening either a David Garcia has run a bad campaign you know we were supposed to have him on Wednesday and they canceled on us Monday for no reason really whatsoever it was only like less than thirty days left to the election I mean if this guy doesn't want to come on the biggest talk show and you know did his point\nAcross maybe he doesn't know what his point is and that's why he's staying away from the media but we offered him an hour on the air and the guy said yes and then he backed\nOut so I you know it makes me think they don't know what the heck they're doing over the Garcia campaign\nYeah I have to agree with you you know he seemed like a great candidate there was a lot of democratic energy around this election and it seemed like if ever there was a chance for the Democrats to to take a shot at having a governor this would be it and they just squandered\nIt but how good team there's got to be the last guy in Douglas a couple of years ago I mean dying Douglas is one of the worst policy when we know why she won because we are either for him but if you can't be drawing on Douglas you're not going to win anything on ...\nYeah and we may see this may be the last campaign that you see Garcia Ryan because you know and talk about in person he's probably really shaking their head right now\nIt's friend involved he's probably thinking why didn't I weighed ... but yeah it it's just been a missed opportunity for them and you know he he's a nice man when you meet Mr Garcia he's a he's a nice man in person she looks good on paper but they cannot seem to pull that off\nOr we're talking with Emily Ryan she's a political consultant with ... consulting group right here in the valley I David Garcia said he's counting on hidden votes to win the election we're we're still not sure what that means what is a hidden vote\n[laughter] you know that's not an industry term then that might be something new to their campaign but I think what he's probably referring to cross over voters ah maybe people who\nHaven't voted in a long time but he can pull from the Republican Party over to his side or maybe from the independent center swath of voters by you know if you're going to do that you can't run as a ultra progressive accident like who wants to open the border with it I I don't get the strategy\nThe one thing that that I didn't understand uh about Garcia or about about governor ... how do you get the independent vote how do you unless you just stay pretty pretty much in your lane I'm so that question well with with Garcia and soon as he said imagine no walls on the southern border\nWall on the southern border you there's no way of coming back from that they've ... just relies on hey I got teachers money and the economy looks great well well that's going to appeal to independent voter again\nAnd and I'm only two things that could ah the independent voter to like about to see it doesn't always go with Trump or you didn't why of separation of children from their parents think independent\nHave families some of the children all by themselves um\nShuttle rock United Church of Christ has taken in people that are looking for sanctuary already\nAnd they have a number of people that have been there for a while but what ISIS done ice has released a statement saying that\nWe just don't have the space and so we can't we can't keep these people so we send them the churches and the churches are like hey we're used to getting like maybe two or five or ten not over a hundred yeah these are families that have requested asylum right which is different than people who are here illegally over\nThe border ... looking for work right ah I think if you obviously if you're if you're seeking asylum you're looking to continue to live\nYou you think you're going to be dead in Honduras and you're going to get get killed in Guatemala you think your your life is going to end so you leave your country of origin and you try and come to the United states and seek asylum so\nBrazil does he know were sent down to the shadow rock United Church of Christ she joins us now KTLA or news reporter uh the only English speaking a station that was there actually and Griselda as as you know as a reporter I Know you have to remain objective but you came back yesterday\nAnd you were telling us some stories that really affected us ... tell us some of the stories and some of the things you saw yesterday at this church with these asylum seekers who are getting off the bus\nRight so as a reporter you know you can go in there and you put on your reporter hats and you're there to collect the facts or bring back the information and kind of describe what happened but it's stories like this that makes it hard to go in without reporter mentality or you know you just can't help\nBut to feel empathy for these individuals especially me as an expectant mother um you know I see all these kids getting off the buses and it just hits you of\nHow a treasure as their journey must have been to get here and and what why they're coming here\nAnd a lot of these kids that we're getting off the bus yesterday lifted very scared\nOr the you know they were volunteers there that were there to greet them and to make them feel welcomed and to kind of get rid of some of that fear that you saw in these kids face is but you still saw that fear in their ... and the kids his faces and it just it it just got to me and and and it wasn't just me\nUm I saw a lot of the volunteers tearing up um you know it does\nA lot of these kids didn't have parents right they were not being Super Bowl or the worst supervise it was like one adult to like eight kids right\nRight I I Would say a lot of these kids were there with their parents or they were yeah quite a lot of them were there with their parents and ah you know that you you could tell that they were kind of really close to their their parents trying to stay as close to them as possible um but yeah you you could just see the fear and their faces\nI I think it's sad I think when you see a people that are fleeing from a very you know desperate and dangerous situation a and they think the United states well we can we can claim asylum there is the first of all the\nUm the the the journey from ... whatever you know Central American country that they came from all the way to the United states that's brutal trip and then you get here and\nYou know I I I Would hope that they're being treated well\nUh we've heard you know some some really terrible stories that they're not treated very well but but I I think it's interesting result in when you were watching and I saw your video um\nThen you weren't you were taking a video but you weren't shooting their faces yeah and so I'm watching this and I'm watching all these little legs get off get off the bus and ... and there were a couple that we're all by themselves and I'm Glad that you said that most of them in where their parents and I'm like man I don't know if I could have watched that that would have been tough for me yeah\nIt was hard to watch their faces and and see a you know the uncertainty of what's going to happen to them on a and one of the things that the church members that I spoke with told me is that\nThey are used to go there they have experience with this so they were going to be giving a that the children teddy bears to help uh you know with that and with that fear\nUm but yeah like you said these people have gone through treacherous journey and they've gone through so many different things to get here and\nUm they're feature in the U.S remains uncertain are a lot of them are seeking asylum a lot of them are from ... in my life is what I was told\n'em ... it's uncertain what's gonna happen to them\nI I Know that the the church is overwhelmed do they want people to help out do do they want the public assistance or no\nRight now they said that they do have all the things that they need right as a writer ... yeah so they they send out a mess\nAnd such to their church members on two different organizations that they partner with and um they said they have everything that they need as of right\nNow okay that's great because others a piano KTLA or a news reporter covering the story where ice has said because of the surge people are still coming here we can't house these people so these people\nThe only thing the federal government gives them is they travel voucher and that's it they are released hopefully to a church hopefully to a center where then they can go and contact their families if they don't have families I don't know where they go\nBut they say in America or to go through the process of asylum which means they go to court\nAh and then they see where it goes from there but uh we you know we got a tip yesterday that this was happening because of course doesn't want to promote this\nUh but it's forty seven hundred people right now that are being released area churches in the valley in ... in Tucson and it could be more down the road\nSo how how are you looking at this not ... but everybody else out there how are you looking at this as a we're all human and we all want to be safe and we don't want to give her kids at home or you go and political on it everything is political these days everything is this going to turn into a political football how many of you out there are thinking\nWell you already is because of the president they can't be here we can't help everybody I mean how ... how many people were going through the process right okay but but you know I just I I I think you've got to have some sympathy for these families because I and I said it for a while\nThis is an um sneaking in the United states because their economy is great and I'm going to a I'm not going to do with the right way I'm just going to sneak in and I'm going to work and I'm going to send all my money back to Mexico it's really not what's happening here we have people that are escaping um gangs and drugs and violence\nSo I Do think it's different I Know we can't you know why does the other day why does Arizona have to house seven hundred asylum seekers why why were we picked over all these other states just because we're\nWe're on the border that ... that's it it's proximity were the closest to the southern border okay and so I mean there are people

coming from Guatemala alone alone alone wild and we we have heard of of the Guatemalan consulate also you know setting up a phone line for people to call in and and to ask for help but\nFrom Guatemala so that means they're making the journey through Mexico first\nTo even get to the U.S so that's happening and then they are being process and then they're being you know sent elsewhere but it's not\nSimply that it's Mexico and Mexicans that are coming to the U.S well they\nCannot apply for asylum either right from what we understand\nRight there are laws there ... there are laws that allow people to speak\nFor asylum and what what Henry ... the director was telling me is that he he knows that say on television in Guatemala they are saying hey\nIf you come with your family family units parents and children under the age of Eighteen or a guardian with somebody under the age of Eighteen and he come to us I'm just go up to an agent claim asylum there are going to end up releasing you within a few days and in fact the director tells me on average\nThe the family unit to the end up being detained are released within twelve to\nFifteen days from custody and there there's just one thing called the Flores settlement where it prevents ice from holding family units and attention for more than twenty days so at the end of the day having so many people coming to the border where the did with kids the tension centers are filled up\nThey can't hold in past twenty days anyway and a lot of them have to be released even sooner because they can't even keep them that's causing a surge of numbers of family ... family units and other immigrants to be released into the community could then be shipped elsewhere\nIf if if these people are here how do we know who they are how do we know who these people are and do they have a record if they're not have a record how does ...\nThe director tells me they do that them so they run background checks on a fingerprint the checks on them they make sure that they don't have any outstanding warrants from other countries or don't have any obvious criminal records from other countries before they are ordered released and a lot of them do end up with ankle monitors to monitor them\nSo they are claiming asylum here how effective or their clinch\nWell about eighty to Ninety percent of those who go to the border to an agent or a port of entry and ask for asylum eighty to Ninety percent of those according to the director up are found to have valid claims of asylum and get our number one that is a very high number\nBut do they all move forward and debt asylum for now they show up at their court hearing\nIt you know and that sort of the you know how can you know for sure that they are going to find out asking\nThat question he says obviously you can't know for sure they will or not but at the end of the day the director tells me at the end of the day\nOf those eight or Ninety percent of those that do have a valid asylum claims and move\nForward only two percent actually ever get repatriated to their country meaning they get removed from the U. S. and deported who were not yes so the Ninety eight percent remaining ended up staying in the U.S whether they make it successfully through an asylum claim or whether they maybe skip out\nOn their court hearing and don't go through the entire problem than that\nI probably the majority stay in the country only two percent get sent back yes and there's no there's no stopping it they they anticipate more people coming right this is not going to go away anytime soon correct [noise]\nGay does best of our ... our news Ninety two three FM\nOpioid addiction has shuttered too many lives and
