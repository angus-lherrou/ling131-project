Tito it is pretty over the top now maybe for Washington standards the Washington DC standards it's not but I think it must be right up there ...\nI think so and I've done some research about the American humane society and they spend a lot of their money on administrative fees and in fact many charitable organization suggests that\nIf you truly want to help patch donate to your local shelter instead of to the larger organization uh by keeping in mind that\nIt you know with Halloween coming up it's so interesting to see how much people spend for dog cost it so it ties right into this people dressing up their dog showing them off and spending over three thousand dollars for a table that that's pretty amazing\nAnd this isn't going away at all any time soon either by the by the way at this dinner where you're spending for a table thirty five hundred minimum minimum it's a nice dinner you don't even get a nice state trooper wrap up this segment for us 'cause\nAll I Know is I watch a fair amount of news on the television and for thirty six hundred dollars or or about where you know we're talking about this price point\nAnd the news on the television and for thirty six hundred dollars or or about where you know we're talking about this price point you can essentially donate to certain children's hospital for Fifteen Years on a monthly basis and spend the same amount of money so I'm at twenty dollars a month times Fifteen Years you're running\nAt about the same rate of as a seat for Reagan dinner and it's terrible\nWe're in a good economy right now of course you

not we're a borderline is a nation with no sovereignty with\nVenture we're going to go towards the bricks in the wall side and the election of Donald Trump I think is one of the key signs of that into the people are tired of the open borders system that the the than the Trump made immigration central issue of his camp campaign\nAnd now when you see in surveys over immigration ranking among the top issues of the voters\nIf people are more and more seeing how immigration policy affects their lives like in my ... my\nFront yard is still a train for the illegal alien pickup joins okay my front yard as the gathering place where the contractors come and pick up illegal aliens for work and so naturally comes at a latrine dumping area and so people like me pay the cost of illegal aliens\nMeanwhile the other rich people who are hiring all these people to do their lawns and and do all that ice where they get the benefits without suffering the cost but other areas ... we've seen is in the higher end in employment visas come one of them was the we might have mentioned is the H. one B. guest worker visa\nThe H. one B. guest worker visa is for people in college educated occupations are patients will generally by a college degree but Congress has designed the system\nOr to replace Americans with cheap foreign workers and that's the purpose of the program\nA sugar coated with descriptions like that that we have a shortage of American workers and we need highly skilled workers to fill jobs that Americans can't do but that's how Congress enacted and people are shocked to discover the Congress has made it legal to replace Americans with foreign workers\nDisney was the best publicized example um but this was going on since the mid Nineteen nineties ends we all get ... and the press ignores it and you know it's a great mystery to me why the New York Times' coverage I'm there does me because it's been going on so long\nBut we've got no of gotten open media attention of this of being really travesty the law\nAnd so the public as more and more discovering that in there that the emergence as does not work for their benefit I'll give you another side of this\nThat when we have image discussions on immigration\nWhen you hear politicians talk about immigration you don't hear them say\nWe're we need an immigration system that works for the average American citizen we don't we don't hear them say we need to immigration system that improves the lives of ordinary Americans normally a discussion of immigration stars or something like oh we need to do so they got the dreamers so we need to do something about you know an amnesty for illegal aliens\nAnd so the average person in the ... average public person\nIs saying I'm you know what about me as a Supreme Court said one of the primary purposes of our immigration laws to protect American workers and we just don't see that in a debate anymore you know if you ask the average citizen they hear persons you're legally thing it why aren't they sent back\nYou know why are people able to you know gain the system and be able to stay stay for a long period of time and we don't have in at least in the political class in business

I mean Australia used to be a colony for ... I don't know if that's a reasonable way to um\nTo satisfy some of this and and kind of mean in the middle someone is finished their term someone you know but we can't let them back into society so I think in certain cases I Am for civil commitment I don't I don't think it's safe to just put certain offenders back out on the street\nAfter these large trucks and buses [noise]\nEighteen wheelers and large buses have big blind spot and like my apartment\nThey don't always have the best view bust and truck drivers do with blind spots around the entire vehicle always take care not to ride alongside are too close behind them our roads our responsibility learn more and share the road safely dot Gov\nOne Ninety degrees ...\nWatch out for your eye\nYou'll get everything for you or your people have to worry about the big stories delivered to your\nDoctor more maybe [noise]\n\nOr if it wasn't the only Arizona's new baby a argue [laughter] we bam [noise]\n\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Brian Clark [noise] long line of Central American migrants continuing to make its way through southern Mexico after\nIllegally crossing Mexico's border with Guatemala NBC's Matt government is with them and he says tensions could climb\nLiterally the Mexican police are prepared for this is a federal police are in full riot gear they're probably very for some sort of on corporate friday's up fish because with those migrants basically they're going to draw a line in the sand here not letting them get any farther north\nPresident Trump on Twitter so the caravans are quote a disgrace to the Democratic party did not clarify or explain the connection\nSaturday he told the Washington Post there's been deception from Saudi Arabia and their account of the death of post columnist or ... the Saudis say he died in a fistfight in their consulate in Istanbul bought Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer today says the president must take action this was horrible [noise]\nThe president is taking far too long to be to\nTurkey's president says he will explain the findings of Turkey's investigation into ... killing on Tuesday\nAuthority to Costa Rica say for Americans were killed along with their ghost recon guy in a rafting accident ... ho river Saturday as Americans we're all between the ages of twenty five and thirty five the state department says it's ready to assist any us citizens in the area\nVoting ... doing it in Afghanistan's parliamentary elections ABC's Jennifer echo some of the foreign desk to the voting was marred by violence and chaos\nA roadside bomb killed nearly a dozen civilians on Sunday including several children the first day of polling militants killed three dozen people in nearly two hundred attacks according to officials\nAt the box office Jamie Lee Curtis returned to Halloween help scare off the competition editor in Seventy seven and a half million dollars to lead the way you're listening to ABC News\nArizona [laughter] [noise]\nThey are on their Ninety two or three of them on line to be a A R dot com streaming live on the gay gene a our news after your breaking news private\nKeeps your new kind of one or two I'm truly the Vin large crowds and long waits led multiple people in need of medical attention during friday night's rally for president Donald Trump Mr fire department says they gave medical attention to thirty five attendees eight of those who needed to be transported to hospitals in\nThe area all but one of the patients dealt with heat related symptoms police estimate twenty thousand attended and no arrests were made\nI Want to win this and then I win that\nThat is president Donald Trump speaking about ...

I recognize up soccer Burke who are some of the other folks involved\n[noise] hit number of um of tech leaders who helped found dead I at this point we're primarily um funded through the channels are back in ... as I'm ... and his wife\nI see and I said well we'll tell us a you know a moving onto onto the report a I'm noticing that uh you know the leaders pretty striking a we know that the population a prison population has a bonded over the last four years\nBut Arizona's even an outlier compared to this trend\n[laughter] that's right Arizona's prison population has grown bite at ... am multiple of twelve\nOr in the last forty years all the rest of the country has grown by multiple for so Arizona's grind three times as fast as the rest of the country and what we found and they're part of that ad that's not due to the underlying population growth as since two thousand Arizona's\nA prison population is crammed about twice as fast as it has it in population um and it's not due to crime which is down significantly over that same Kerry and\nWell I can speak to this specifically because that for a year a timeframe coincides almost precisely with my own time and Arizona\nAnd in the early Nineteen eighties there was a quote unquote a criminal justice reform headed by a fellow named Steve twist to his assistant attorney general of Arizona they\nMassively increase sentencing live in ... length of sentences imposed mandatory sentences and the light but severe restrictions on judicial description or on judicial discussion\nAnd uh you you could see with that just thinking of the arithmetic of it that it was a long term ticking time bomb because if you take somebody who's getting a ten year sentence for something and you make it twenty you've had knowing\nIt that it was a long term ticking time bomb because if you take somebody who's getting a junior sentence for something and you make it twenty you've had no impact on the prison population for the first ten years but starting in your eleven and in the years you start to\nAnd in other circumstances people that are ex felons uh people that um our family members um and they begin to find the complexity of the problem\nAnd the real stories that may not be what they see on the headlights ago oh there's more underneath this this is a bigger problem and these are people that are are suffering from from the impacts of all of this\nOr at least one of your meetings this this go round is actually in the prison has enough\nYes so we were out at Lewis prison I'm a ... last week at ten days ago and\nI inside the prison and working with people in the new just a second chance programs so they were probably there were five to six of prisoners due to ready to be released a shortly that Saturday staple in disgust with people that their issues and they're concerned\nThat's a far cry used to be your your just went up to the Grand Canyon isolated yourself from the world is a little more hands on and so\nA tone you've read their research reports for for ... ... what's your what's your ...\nAs a citizen and your job your background this was not professional your your background is as an educator uh from from the standpoint of a in both citizen what's your big takeaway\n[noise] um [noise] the big takeaway is that this is a social problem there are so many aspects to this set we've tried to to criminalize it all but in fact\nAs one of a prisoner once told me that you know we try to talk about rehabilitating\n'em me but I was never ability stated we have so many issues that lead into prison people into prison I'm that we're not we're not resolving and the majority of people are almost probably Seventy five percent a show that they have some drug and alcohol problem\nStallman you look at the figures Yusuf drugs are everywhere\nAnd then you have mental health issues that probably overlap that as well so why why are they in prison and the ... you know what are we doing about those issues um uh so\nThat it's just a very complex problem but it certainly is a social problem that touches everyone really one way or another it cost us a lot of money [laughter]\nOr let me one of our biggest finding for for um the report was that the number of people going out and just for drug possession had at crown by hundred and forty two percent since two thousand so thirty five hundred people I'm off going every year and that's definitely the kind of thing you know\nWe know that those people can be treated safely ... and more effectively in a community a\nWire locking them up pride Dixon [laughter] right [laughter]\nWhat are the things that struck Munoz report that just jumps out in terms of Arizona as an outlier is that in this may surprise people love to sift through straits Arizona is number four in terms of road of incarceration in a chart in your report shows\nWere beaten by Mississippi Louisiana and some state uh unnamed on your shirt\nSo it should be Oklahoma [laughter] ah what's\nThe first year if if it's if it's so much drugs you know the drug rehabilitation programs are notoriously unsuccessful\nOr what's the fix if the if you're if if people are in in prison for our big big numbers are in in in prison for drug related things what's ... what's the alternative\nWell there are programs that kind of work and and other states have um reinvest that money

and the work I've done in the state Senate and the state house before going to Congress\nBut I'm not particularly proud of parties\nBecause you know in your ads it mostly doesn't well actually I don't think I've seen a D It doesn't is that on purpose\nThat's right because I Am an independent voice for Arizona is and I want folks to 'em when they see my ads or hear from me or when I'm Talking to them and listening to them I Want them to think about who I Am as their elected official and that's our public servant\n... okay\nWhat do you think of I thought you would have totally dodge that question I thought you would have said\nAs a Democrat I Believe in this I Believe in this I Believe in this\nThat it wasn't so independent why is it so important to make that independent leap why not say I'm not affiliated with the Democratic party run as an independent like a Joe Lieberman\nAnd do it that way tried that once remember ... ... well true but it's a different election it's at a time yeah but I I'm just surprised okay okay and that's fair that's fair but\nYou know the knock I I guess the knock against your campaign is that\nWe haven't seen you out enough we haven't you know this is the first time we've we've talked to you during this campaign during this election is that we didn't we just talk in August\nThat we talked when McCain pass when McCain has yeah but not not really about the election\nNow he's right yeah I didn't write that right now campaigning\nDuring the white people are saying oh you're hiding or you're not you don't think so no\nNo you know I've been spending my time going at literally every single day to different events where I'm listening to voters and meeting voters I you guys I'm sure shocked me on Twitter so you've probably seen those photos and I don't know what you're talking about [laughter]\nSo I you know I'm Out every single day on talking to voters listen to folks I was in Tucson on all day yesterday we're supposed to have a debate Martha and I\nAre in Tucson yesterday and she decided not to do it so I wanted to debates yes I wanted one\nI think we deserve to have a debate and both Phoenix and Tucson because folks and you know both major metropolitan areas estate deserve to have their own debate I'm In the governor's race I did a debate yet leaders in Tucson so that's what I wanted to do\n... state deserve to have their own debate I'm In the governor's race I did a debate yet leaders in Tucson so that's what I wanted to do\nDemocratic candidate in Arizona Senate race representative here since ... joining us in Studio\nCan we get down to this thing to do thing because this was an ad that I think was effective doesn't have to be wasn't nice I mean I'm not sitting there saying it was nice but wasn't I drew okay what can you take us back to what the real story is the day when you were wearing a pink to do and do you regret it\nUh well first let me say that Fifteen Years ago I was opposed to the war and this is a war in Iraq yes which is still happening ... um that what's unfortunate about what Martha chose to do in that ad was to falsely alleged that I was protesting our troops and that actually\nThat was that that bothered me because you guys now that's my own brothers serve in the military right oh my big brother is a marine or he's now retired he is the canine sergeant for the Tucson police department\nAnd I couldn't be prouder than I Am of him and my little brother is still serving an active duty today he's in the navy he's like honors made he's deployed six times in this war six times in this war\nSo I was you know I I felt like it was really unfair and sort of fact checkers three fact checkers said\nYou know Martha's claim about your son is false I have never protests our troops because that's my own family and as you guys know how seriously I take the issue of taking care of our veterans you know yes like you I'm like a dog with a bone right to take care of the men and women who serve our country so what I thought was unfortunate about that\nAt an in addition to my hair um was the was that the really the false allegation\nWell let me let me talk about your hair to um I thought and and my wife brought this up to me my wife was ... and and truth be told my wife is very conservative from Wyoming very much of a you know we'll do it will take care of it ourselves can do attitude you know\nShe was appalled that a woman attacked another woman based on their dress their appearance hair you know to to to how\n... how did how did you take that because I was surprised\nA woman would attack another woman based on looks or based on what they were wearing almost like a a a shame you know a address shaming thing instead of saying here's some cinema voted for this I don't stand for this\nThe ... to to was brought up how did how did you feel about that or did you did you get the same reaction that my wife had a I Can't believe they're they're down on them done in the dirt with this uh what she's wearing stuff\nWell Martha has chosen Toronto very low road on this campaign her entire campaign has been focused on personal a really dirty smears against me and false attacks and that's the road she's chosen\nUm but even when I'm not on your show you guys know that I I listen to you so I Know that you've talked about this before and uh\nAs you have no talked about the you mean to to to know about our campaign ya ya okay and as you all have noted many times on your show a I don't campaign like that right I don't do that was that a ... was that a decision you made\nAt the very beginning or is that something that involves of okay do we fight back to we attack back or know\nWho is what I Believe in I Believe that you can have a difference of opinion with someone else\nAnd you can do it politely you can be respectful about it and you can say focus just like your wife said on the issues in the votes every time we have ever talked we've agreed some of the time and we just read some time\nBut one thing I'll say I love coming on Mac and get us because it's can be respectful we're polite to each other and professional to each other we have a little fun we disagree and we agree that is how our system should be and I am disappointed very disappointed\nThat Martha has chosen to run a campaign based on ... attacks and we saw that\nYou know most recently in the debate mhm do you dislike mix Sally no I don't and in fact before the Senate race she and I worked together on a lot of issues we were both representing Arizona yeah and it worked together on legislation\nAbout after the kids should at home and argue fuming from some of the ads that do I look like on fear and don't know I'm not you know I mean\nI understand that this is a political tactic that she's chosen\nI Am disappointed by it because I think it lessens the importance of what we're doing and what we're talking about in this country\nReal Arizona's have real needs right now they're not getting what they need or what they deserve from our government and what she's chosen to do in the campaign doesn't answer any questions or concerns me in line like let's get you some health care let's figure out how to get education\nLet's take care of our veterans and so I'm staying focused on the issues laser focused and she's over there\nDoing these increasingly desperate activities\nDoes best of our Jay Z a our news Ninety two three of them\nAnd we desperate activities [laughter]\nDoes best of our K C A R news Ninety two three of them\nToday the economy is strong
