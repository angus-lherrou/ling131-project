Copa they have to dig out the swords and they have to put 'em everywhere and then you fall down on the sword depending on how many times that you want the audio by the way this controversy with this we'll get to that and say it's so she comes out today\nI'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nYou may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes\nAnd that conversation turns or whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making their darker to make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume wound okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nSo she starts out with that and I look if you want to go as Diana Ross and you're doing it out of respect I I Know I've never had it like I I'm just sitting here and in the fact that we've been talking about this but there's a bigger thing at play here it's the fact that so many people are allowed to\nTo somebody and and it's not a lot it's it's a few people are allowed to control the conversation where we go because everybody's worried about I better be on the right side of this so people are going to be\nMad at me I don't remember of God I I was a\nKid watching this thing and there was a guy who I don't know if you remember the show producer filled there used to be this lip sinking show on it was on up to like solid gold or American Bandstand and one of these things and this guy dressed up half is Diana Ross and I think the other half as a they did mindless love was that the one uh Richie\nAnyhow and a half and half and it was amazing today could you do that you can't kick\nI'm Wondering when are people just out of the you know you can be a drag queen because you're in your your your culturally appropriating females which is happening by the way but she wasn't finished here\nOne of the great parts of sitting in his chair each day and getting to discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday I learned I learned that given the history of blackface being used an awful ways by race it in this country\nIt is not okay for that to be part of any ... in Halloween or otherwise\nI have never been a few things kind of person but I Do understand the value and being sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity this past year has been so painful\nFor many people of color the country feels so divided and I\nNo wish to add to that pain\nOkay All right I mean look I I understand that but you were talking about somebody dressing up like Diana Ross paying homage saying it's OK you weren't talk and when you talk about and the races out did you think a racist or listening to you're going oh my God guys you know before we go burn this cross\nI really need to get my facts of Megan Kelly 'cause no they're not they're not paying any attention to their idiots out that there will always be it\nBut\nI'm going to throw them out there and produce a bill you and I are the same age we grew up watching many of the same shows did you ever once in your life with your friends play cowboys and Indians all the time cultural appropriation\n\nGo to the Halloween store looking all the stuff he fun\nIs it meant if it's meant it here and this is the way I've always looked at stuff people\nWho want it to mean at a certain way particularly if they want to be awful\nWe're the biggest message they're going to do that anyways they are\nI think the fact that NBC and everybody is destroying her shows you though that more people are worried about the kill if you will in this media world than they are the message\n\nThat dance and came several years ago he was dating Whoopi Goldberg at the time right like crazy he showed up I think it's something and he was in blackface and people were offended and he's with Whoopi Goldberg and it was her idea\nWell times have changed we've gotten much more woke now we've got much more sensitive\nWas it meant that he made it in a racist way no he didn't he didn't mean it in a racist way but it's no longer how it's meant in life it's how it's perceived I don't think she did anything wrong\nBut I Do do that this time next week it's Halloween and we will talking about the horrible costumes that people were oh my God this person did that or that person did this and you know it's like ... and I was talking to somebody today it's like well dreadlocks which somebody was mad at I forgot who it was it wasn't the uh [noise]\nIt is and you know it's like ... and I was talking to somebody today it's like well dreadlocks like somebody was mad at I forgot who it was it wasn't a a one of the stars when the young kids got red locks and they're like oh it's cultural appropriation I'm like really cause the Greeks had dreadlocks\nAnd then people get into an argument about whether or not that's real and like this is the kind of stupidity that we live in now we're debating stuff like this\nGet over it hair right and if people are racist an awful you being Hoover politically

and Seventy five thousand leftover\nUh-huh that's on right that's right okay what are we gonna do with that\nWas my question I'm sure I I Want to work around the world are not going out on a ... um my husband does not have one time we could start off with holes with tourism yes with another sixty five hundred stricken\nBut that doesn't mean that that helped I mean I just wrote a six thousand out of

do and get all the matches everything you can just completely max all that out and then that's what we're doing and then the only thing left to do is just start investing and then you decide what you're going to invest in\nReno nevada is up versus our Darryl is one of those high Darryl welcome to the Ramsey show [noise]\nHi Mr Ramsey pleasure to talk to you you too sir what's up man\nHey I I got a little bit of a different question I haven't really heard you talk about it on the on the air before but I'm just a little bit of background and my wife and I were in baby steps to we have\nBeen working the snowball last October and\nWe're twelve thousand dollars away from chicken Sallie Mae out of the house and we'll be done or something to do our debt prescribing next hopefully next spring so\nWe're on our way I'm Glad that we are\nA coordinating our third financial piece class ...\nAnd one of the things that keeps coming up that we're trying to figure out and also help advise others as you know we're a single income family and all that stays at home or helping track your outrage sure\nAnd and last month I had known as anybody else on a lake last month we had to go and they're all ... up again and so we're we're spending like twelve hundred dollars a month to carry the family on working track and you know co pay 'em trapped by an everybody in the area of kind of you all are cool could choose from just\nEverything's expensive here and so a bomb under is going into oh I Know it's an eerie dating and one one of the things I just I just want to\nI kind of want to walk them and throw it away and\nI'm One of the things we've been looking to be a Christian health share ministries and I think for a while you might have been your door from one for a while I Can't remember but we have anyways we're we've got it from other families in her class or your finger income just paying thousand dollars a month for\nPretty ... video for helping her in you know we can do a family on healthcare mystery strike for your mind about ...\nI just I wanted to get your pay can see you know something especially in baby steps to you know where\nMy wife and I talked about or a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency trials but now I don't know we're trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and\nFor some other things over the years I'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here this Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo ah and I'm real careful on the show as you know or even through financial ... not recommend people to do something I don't do\nThat kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available to me um and show a Christian healthcare ministries um the the you know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance as you know\nIt is like all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or innocence becomes cooperatives down his what it's doing\n'em and uh the the\nYou know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record and these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim\nNow you have to read and you should read very carefully to what it coverage and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing\nFamily plan their singles plan all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered and what is not covered learn how it works um because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim show which worked for forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades rise so uncomfortable with its credibility in that regard\nIt is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in it\nNumber three the only way I'll do it as if they had a long long long track record which the\nOne number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in it and number three the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... ... their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so they're already hard core in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they ... you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process you're Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's what it's for and how it's laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that way and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question how we were to go through that doing in baby steps to and all that kind of step one of the things that my wife with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking into that as the long term track record and and we're okay we're all the requirements we're yeah we're we're evangelical Christians and all that out of ... and we're ever normally pretty healthy [laughter] it seems like it'd be good for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like when I say for Fifteen hundred bucks and stuff so if you're a baby sit here with you recommend it when you go that route\nTo set aside that that grew out of dollars to insulate you against our\nOr if you've got an already you've already got a thousand and baby sit around and so you're close enough\nAnd if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget slow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps who covers some bills if you had an event right right right and it's just like carrying largest adoptable as you said in a nature or something I'm but I'm going to take that\nPart of the risk gone for sure and I'm so forth but but you know Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are you\nHave to say Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise] so I\nWent in you know whether or not um my husband and I should move 'em in order to get out of that [noise] um we don't like our house\nOkay um so we're out of debt you might be moving anyway\nRight okay absolutely um the balance on more gadget two hundred and fifty five thousand dollars I'm like wow you what's the value [noise] about four hundred and eighty thousand okay All right\nAnd I you know our debt other than the market is about a thousand dollars\nMhm mhm um but I mean they can trust K. K. to move and in order to get out of that\nWell I mean if you did and put a hundred and twenty thousand dollars down at the next place could you afford to make that happen yeah\nOkay 'cause that would make you dead free and put then you're not you should have about a hundred and twenty left after expenses and everything and eighty ... eighty of data paid off right\nRight so um [noise] um yeah that that seems to make sense if you want to move anyway I Do want to move to Atlanta you know you're going to move up and house equal house just different area or down and had\nTo have a little bit up in the house\nMhm he'll be on the mortgage would be even looking mortgage it'd be higher um but\nOn a Fifteen next right on a Fifteen Years so yeah right yeah and your payment to be no more than a fourth of your take home pay yeah have you can do all of that and you get out of a house you don't like into a house or do like there's no downside to this move okay\nBut then you know the point is we're trying to get out of debt house and everything long term so we gotta aim at that and um you know go there as fast as you can so\nAppreciate your joining U.S Open phones or triple eight eight to five five two to five Jessica follows me on Facebook dot com slash day Ramsey how should someone using your plan to go about creating a residual income\n\nWell there's only one way to create residual income that's not some kind of Internet scam and when I hear some want to ask you a question about residual income I usually think scam\n'cause that's usually what is referring to okay so let's just kind of get that out on the table residual income is income that comes in steadily that you don't work for\nOn earned income it's investment income as what real residual income at\nAnd or you create some kind of a business I have royalties on a book I wrote in Nineteen Ninety two that I got a check in yesterday that's residual income it's continuing to come in right I'm Still making money on that but one of the big jak but it's still jak shut up okay so you know but he's residual\nIt's continuing to come in right I'm Still making money on that wasn't a big check but it's still ... shut up okay so you know but it's residual income so that's ... rural teaser residual income investments create residual income investing and good mutual funds\nToning rental property ripple proper use residual income on the runners pay the rent assuming that they get to stay and all that kinda stuff every month right um and so that's residual income but don't fall into this you know people use some term that sounds sexy and get yourself into some crap lizard I Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nYou've heard me talk about our deep for\nYears and how it's only a matter of time before\nBut yeah I asked they learn anything in the process\nI think health fail [laughter]\nGood okay well congratulations you guys were very proud of even congratulations on beating the rain to him room and that's an incredible story thank you very cool and I hear your set with a paid for house yeah what's that thing worse\nI it's probably three fifty to three eighty\nBearing not and insurers so [laughter] it's years by the way nobody's going to get that one though is yours I Love it that that's a different feeling bugs so that never been there it's a different feeling after you've been through stuff like you guys have been through are\nSharing and I went through losing everything and nobody's coming into my house\nIt's mine is paid for very well done you guys very well done we got a copy of Chris Hogan book for you retire inspired number one bestseller that should be the next chapter in your story millionaire status is what we're going for next and outrageously generous along the way so congratulations you guys\nThinking like you don't have the girls been practicing the debt free screen they at least the younger to anyone I okay teenagers or to go yeah yeah okay\nAll right Toby Christie Kelly Megan garment and Taylor from everything am Illinois two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars paid off in the six and a half years making a hundred to one Seventy counted down here a debt free scream\nThree kids to want well\n[noise] man absolutely fabulous congratulations you guys are question that comes from blinds dot com they have a one hundred percent satisfaction guarantee\nMeans even if you mess up\nIf you missed measure I could have done that if you pick the wrong color could have done that they will remake your window blondes free all of this company blondes dot com gives you free samples free shipping and with a new promos run every month all they'll always say you're ... years the ...

Charlotte Caitlin how can I\nCan miss 'em so I started my own cleaning business fortune and I just saw last year um I'm twenty three year old and I know I Want to do something else on to her narrow ah but I just have to figure out what that is I wanted to be something I I didn't know about\nUm I have been in car sales for the last year hoping that sounded as I Would come out of it related to cars but I just haven't come up with anything and kind of feeling discouraged so hoping you might be able to help with that okay\nWell that's very interesting so obviously you love cars is that right is that what I'm getting out of this you are told me about that what specifically do you love about cars\n[noise] I I just I Love 'em I mean I Want to drive them but I also get I think that there are so unique in the way that they're\nUm designed and built and trying to gather 'em I enjoy feeling different ones and I'm just kind of\nGot learning more about that and there are ... okay so the ideas you

triple eight eight to five five two to five Tripoli eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington Cody how can how\nCan a thank you for taking my call so I'm about five years and she my career field and ITN cyber security and um\nI currently make a hundred and five thousand a year I'm I've completed a all of these baby stopped so I don't have a wife or a cat and\nAh and then they have all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job that is less stable\nEither and I'm being full time and it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year a cyber attack there to compel thing and ah I've I've been raised ...\nYou know try to keep a stable job um you know you could be on five days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and um but\nI I think sometime pretty young and I don't really have you know an off the support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on a either staying at my job or taken the position\nWell let's start with how excited are you forget the stability issue which I'll get to momentarily how excited are you about this opportunity\nIt it's pretty awesome or the field itself I I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going to a job but like a chore or anything like that I I I enjoy it so yeah I'm a opportunity to ah to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nOkay two times what your me okay so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply it by the hourly rate so IT consulting so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I'll have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nWell I ... that even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth All right\nBut is there some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... ... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in the position and um and they they say that if that's about average um yeah OK yet but they they've had some months or they they don't get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps of and you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it how what is your three to six months emergency fund look like how big is\nThat that Fifteen thousand\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get that up to thirty or fifty you know a\n... position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role would you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're feeling that the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you've got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nAt the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me\nYeah so I Do you celebrate tonight my goodness don't overseeing this I mean half of half of the ... love to be worked

Wondering if if what I got as a hobby or just your career so just a little bit of a back story after I've been paying job that extra benefit kept their share that with my passion I take it a fifty percent pay cut to to make the switch\nAnd and as I went to the profession you know quickly right in that I don't know if they write a paper and I think I might have jumped the gun I just read it in fact probably\nWell tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial advising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nA day to day ah basically just knock on doors who I Am what I Do and you know try and get them to um you know may so that I can help him with a retirement plan and education\nSo are you working for a local firmer Jew open up your own shop\nAnd you know it's it's a it's a national um\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provided the early ... okay\nDid you jump into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon 'cause you didn't plan financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and I you know there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly\nSo is this the right thing for me and and and the ... there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly why did you jump for this why financial planning\nSo you know I've been with the day for the last ten years Crowley and you know I've always had to actually maybe that would help folks where the planet retirement\nWhen I went to a very you know kind of told my story you know that you're doing like a great and um you know get get no truck came across a ... when we went with it and it just it's not working out\nWell did you plan financially for this or someone you know I had about three to six months of expenses\nWhich is a quickly depleted ... and uh\nYou know I thought it was a you know and I never got that always had excelled though you know I thought that's really no different go in you know kill it you know and and uh you know I look I'm working on commission\nHave you been able well here here out the way here's the situation you went after a a financial advisor role that's what you went after because you want to sit down and help people with their finances but the problem is you signed up for a door to door sales jobs that that's what's going on and I don't know\nIf straight commission sales is the thing for you the reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders\nAre and maybe some some of your co workers to see why they think this is working pretty quickly you got to make a decision or and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right place 'cause he's got the talent to give people advice and coaching\n'em and you have the desire to do it maybe you're just not in the right format the right setting to be able to do that so get some feedback reassess let's get stable

or go ahead Ashley\nAll right so uh so you ... the here's a funny thing you're you're ... you're complaining about this every day I haven't gotten one you haven't gotten any no I haven't gotten any robo tax or I don't know if I'd gotten robocalls because if I don't know a number it goes I just let it go to but\nYou haven't gotten attack and I was enjoying Iran you need to host\nOf voting party I'm like oh who are these people\nI don't know any of the people I Want to go to a vote in part I don't free food I see you have to host the free booze you have to hope I don't want to hosted I don't want to pay for that that's what I'm saying what I don't know when you see the ads that are all over the place or these robo called robo calls home right exactly [noise]\nThat I 'cause I don't think there's anything wrong with it I I don't know exactly what they'll do but but it might\nBe all for show and I think that's okay but I'm not going to fix the problem\nBecause again once these people come in and claim aside when we're not talking about illegal immigrants crossing the border from Mexico sneaking Italy sneaking in illegally to make some money or get a better life we're talking about the caravan from Guatemala and Honduras\nThat once they get in the country and claim asylum they have every right to be here which they have every right to review legal right the military isn't necessary what what are they going to do except\nIf they provide relief or build tents for these people to stay in the process I I don't know but they can't stop them from coming in is my point\nI mean can they can form a physical barrier from them coming in I think it shows you a lease the president's trying to do something\nOkay and that is fair and that's fair yeah but but I don't think that sending the military to the border as some people on social media have suggested well let them try to get past the military if we space them out every hundred or two hundred and ... they're not going to be doing that they won't have guns right they did not see any by\nJust like the national guard troops there assisting\nThe border patrol and you're going to see the military also assist\nThe border patrol I still like the move uh maybe maybe this gets out to some of the other countries like you know some say in Central America like Honduras and the uh Guatemala and and they hear while the United states is now putting the military on the border maybe I'll stay where maybe I'll stay where I Am\nI don't think this move hurts even if it's for show even if it's to get a vote for maybe a Republican because Trump is doing it\nI think if you have the power to do it why not I'll tell you what I Would do though you know who I Would send to the border I'd send judges to the border and I'd lying judges up on the border and you know what I Would do I would have them a rocket docket I Would have him do the case right there and then yes you can say come on and no you can't come in\nBecause of this that and the other thing now does that's what I Would I wouldn't say eight hundred\nA troops to the border I send a thousand judges to the border and there you go rock rocket\nLet's say let's say that could happen let's say you could get a thousand judges or so and put them in Arizona California New Mexico Texas right mhm okay we are now negotiating with Mexico about that to try to turn these people around and saying to Mexico\nWe know that you don't take foreign nationals in other words you know when we when we take somebody from ah Mexico and we say you were being deported we give them back to Mexico Mexico says we don't\n... in other words you know when we when we take somebody from ah Mexico and we say you were being deported we give them back to Mexico\nMexico says we don't want anybody that's not a not a citizen we don't want to we don't want want amounts we don't want Hondurans that's why we can't turn around other people from other countries at the Mexican border Mexico says we don't want to deal with them we are now negotiating with Mexico to see\nIf you let them pass into your country which they have some of them have right there in Mexico right in thousand ... well well but the ones they let in legally\nIf we take them and decide that they are not supposed to be you know if they claim poverty well that's not like a gang is going to kill me or my family right\nCan we turn them around and then you deport them and if Mexico says yes\nThat is a big big win because then it's not\nOur problem they never get in the country that is now Mexico's problem and if Mexico plays this right they can make a lot of money for this probably work I avoid them or Trump would say hey we'll give you so many billions of dollars more a year but now it becomes Mexico's problem and not our problem that would be better if the\nTwo things that were working on is a U.S negotiating with Mexico about whether migrants from the Caribbean could be deported from Mexico before they get here the other thing that apparently we're discussing with Mexico is a before they get here hold them in Mexico\nKeep them there are ... and I I don't know if it's like a tent that they would use their salaries and city I Would imagine hold them there\nAnd then start releasing maybe a hundred a day at a time at a time so we are not seven thousand all once\nYou're not crushing you're actually you know you see this in in places like the cardinals game of the sun you know that line you have to go around in your loop around well that's crowd control instead of just massing outside of talking stick resort arena right you have to go through that amazed that keeps it all orderly\nWhat we're asking Mexico to do is give us a hundred at a time instead of a crush of thousands of people and it's\nI I think what this shows is at least at least Trump\nIs trying to do something there's negotiations going on in sewers threatening going on there's no there's no ... you know a will still separate your your kids and from the ... thank goodness we're not there now what she's doing right now makes a lot more sense negotiate with Mexico here the few things on the table right\nUm send the military down there that stuff makes makes sense to me let's let's make sure our borders as secure as we can possibly get it because obviously we both want that and I think most of you in Arizona want
