your opponent 'cause it's all about this for Trump that's what it is they're they're underestimating show much of this and it's it's not it's not good for them you know looking over the weekend at two

as far as learning goes why aren't kids are progressing the way that they should be what's holding them back what can we do for our educational system that is going to help push kids forward and

shows your Twitter you can tweet at us plus we're going to touch on a Paul Allen is passed away the co founder of Microsoft he was sixty five years old you're talking about that a little later as well

deficiency is linked to an increased risk of heart disease kidney disease high blood pressure diabetes and stroke\nThat's according to the national heart lung and blood Institute when I found my pillow and started staying asleep longer and sleeping more deeply I vowed I Will never use another pillow\nAnd that's true but then they say so we really need to train people for the hardest jobs today that I kind of misses the point for two reasons first of all you know say everyone should be trained to be a data scientist yes there are a lot of data scientist that we need right now but you know the whole economy is not a scientist\nThere's you know a lot more to the world than that but also if things are changing as quickly as they are then say well we're going to build an education of course building anything takes time we're going to build an education on the needs of the day that still skating to where the puck is rather than where the puck is going\nAnd the only way we can skate to where the puck is going\nIs recognized that we are not going to know so we can say All right this is a destination said we have to train people to be resourceful and creative adaptable\nOn their own we can say this if the job of the future we're going to teach kids how to do that job we have to say we don't know what the job of the future is going to be we have to train them to be resourceful and adaptable and creative and insightful on their own so they can figure it out\nTalking to Danny any his new book is leverage learning how the disruption of education helps lifelong learners an expert with something to teach and I like what you you know you say there is we need to go to where the puck is going to be not where the puck is and I think they're therein lies the\n... the issue because we're we're teaching kids right now to just kind of go where where things are and we're telling my son's eight I Want him to get a ... have an understanding that the world that he's living in today is going to be totally different in ten years as fast as technology goes when you look at education across the board not just higher education\nIf you could change one thing if I gave you sit down and looked and let you change one thing what's the one thing from\nTop to bottom that you would like to see done do you think would make a huge impact on the future of education\nAre the ones that so I have small children my my daughter's three and a half my son is two and this is very top of mind for me when I think of um elementary and high school education especially but it applies\nYou know throughout a career I I think there are a lot of things that that your case and I was doing wrong today but the the one that I think it's insurmountable is it trains people to look to someone else to set their priority\nRight if they're teaching them the wrong things you know I can supplement that at home if they are not hiring people with the right skills you know you can you can get that in other places information's wrong and find it somewhere else but this idea that you know you're going to go to whatever the educational context is all metro school high school college whatever\nRight you're going to sit in a class do what you're told and suddenly someone else is going to tell you how things are going to work someone else is going to tell you what is important someone else is going to tell you what is and isn't worth paying attention to\nThat causes all of the most important parts of our of our brain of our faculty is that we need to thrive in the modern world it atrophy right 'cause you need to be the people in the driver's seat if we want to be able to figure things out in the future\nOh absolutely and I don't think that you know again it it it's very frustrating because we have this one size fits all education system that I don't think really works\nAnd I just it it's it's a very tough thing I look at this I have an eight year old and I see the world he's living in he's in the stem school does all these kinds of things that you know\nThat ... that it did it looks great it sounds great but I often wonder one of the things you're talking about in here and you just talked about a bit of that but like the fortitude you know this how tough keep going when the going gets tough because I think that's one of the things that that is missing in this day and age especially with the younger generation is\nYou put stuff in front of them and it doesn't work it seems like they just collapse under it and that is everything from sports\nTo friendships to even education\nIt's a big challenge I mean I I mean it's it's a challenge boring of the very best intentions you nuts but the road to help pay with good intentions but in an effort to protect our kids from everything\nWe've taken away their ability to deal with things that are difficult to make hard decisions break the key to Fort Hood shooting a lot of ways it's not I'm not going through at the first experience of there's always fascinating research ACTs at first childhood\nHe's a first childhood experiences like traumatic really horrible things that we don't want to happen to anybody child or adult\nAnd there is a huge correlation between the more of these adverse childhood experiences to have\nThe less likely you are to be successful the more likely you are to be incarcerated lifetime earnings are lower all that kind of stuff but it doesn't always play out that way and it's not about the next year and it's about the lack of\nSupport and reinforcement after him through that experience where I thought about you know this thing that I wanted to happen I certainly didn't and that sucks it's about this thing doesn't happen the way I wanted and it sucks and nobody told me that I'm Still going to be okay\nRight so it's not about shielding people from those challenging experience it's about putting women it enabling them not putting them in in situations the enabling them to have those experiences and learn some there's some fascinating research I was looking at the other day about risky play\nAbout when you look at children today um it it's like their whole environment is basically bubble raft you look at as a child playground today and like everything on the ground is like super sauce and there's nothing they can fall off of or bump into\nThat so it's like the extreme of essentially having your kids bubble raft but\nThe opposite of that is risky play what were you doing we were kids right you know jumping on rock climbing trees and you do those things and occasionally is in the fall down and scraped and whatever and the the research shows is fascinating correlation between risky played as a child\nAnd produced a drug consumption of the human nature a teen pregnancy all kinds of things because when as a child or never given the opportunity to have to make decisions that are hard in the moment\nYou don't have that muscle you're not able to make the important some difficult decisions so it's a combination of empowering\nKids to to be in situations where yeah they might screw up on the circumstances and outcomes may not be ideal you know with guard rail to keep them safe or as much as possible but you know let them have the opportunity to screw up to be there to tell them not you know your perfect and everything's okay but\nLook you can get through this you have what it takes the lessons here is to try harder you need to do something differently the lesson is not to give up you can handle that and they're here we're here to support that stuff\nHighly movie ... the you know and and I love that you know to me\nUh it's funny my son's a and he's always says you know mom always wants to bubble wrap me that's all she wants to ... save can she make me ... you're just and I'm I'm you know I'm a seventies raised and I'm like yeah you know what it's good to eat dirt because\nYou know you won't get sick it's like that's how my mom or your kind of raises you're going to get hurt don't do that again and we've taken that away and I think we take away those obstacles for kids\nIt really hurts them I said the other day Danny that\nI look at it in in the world we live in now and kids nowadays it's play dates everything is controlled but then when we look on YouTube and all these things they tried to do crazy stuff because I feel like there's some shelter that they will try to drink you know I eat a pound of cinnamon or whatever they possibly can cause I feel like that's the only freedom they're getting\n... and they're going into those like really\nCrazy extreme challenges without any ... you know how you know we all we went to college we have time to to you know go out and start drinking does things for the first time and it doesn't take very long to get a sense of your limits right you know I'm OK with one or two beers you know three or four or five is a bad idea\nRight we all learn what those limits are for ourselves but we're we're looking at a generation of kids who've never had the opportunity to get a feel of what their limits are and so when they're suddenly in a position which essentially everyone gets to a position of freedom\nThey are not equipped to make good decisions\nNo no no it is crazy the books called leverage learning how the disruption of education

Indiana alright welcome to Nashville and all the way here to do a debt free screen oh yeah I Love it how much of you to pay it off\nSo we paid off a hundred and forty two thousand five hundred dollars and twenty eight months\nGood for you and your ranger income during that two and a half years we started out about Ninety thousand and ended it about a hundred and forty five thousand wow great what I'll do for a living on a physical therapists and are on the engineering assistant\nAt a local electric utility company very cool well congratulations gosh so what kind of what was the one hundred and forty thousand dollars\nWell answer this question because all of it was mine unfortunately I'd Fifteen five in a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to get all that we may say wow\nHow long have you guys been married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what how many your story\nBut we were just kind of doing a normal thing um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program and I actually heard you come across the radio um while I was driving around in my work track and uh just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong or or no and we started it out\nAnd uh she just kind of followed my lead on it a while which is like that yeah yeah it was it was I mean she's a follower and she\nWas really good I have some leadership [laughter]\nShe's a girl our word she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go see financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave ... and then you can ... you take somebody does my back exactly\nYell at the the video guy yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer and I was the numbers you know because I kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see for yourself so what happened when you went to the class coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nHere I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and that the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and I had this crazy burden because it was all mine yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah lately and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt was realistic\nWhen you first George you I mean I Do do do it this fast we a lot of ... it was a long\nYeah it was hard we started that if I asked the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was it it was hard\nI mean two years and four months running and yeah and that's what that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand bombers and you killed at all if yeah how old are you to um ... well we're both twenty eight and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these rockstar also millennials I talk about all the time [laughter]\nVery good good for you guys thinking well time very cool how does it feel now that you've climbed the mountain\nIt's so great it's incredible [laughter]\nI think it's one of the best feelings it's nice to know that we can move on to the baby steps now and we just want to live and give like no one else Monday so we're excited for us to keep travelling through the baby steps\nYeah women you're making a hundred fifty thousand bucks a year and I'll even Thirty years old and army payments in the world you know life is pretty good yeah that's an awesome show or who are your biggest cheerleaders\nI think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing and I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction panels quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of debt\nPeople started to come around now when you look at somebody go up already put over a hundred thousand dollars a comes shut them up you know absolutely no\nYou know it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it\nThat's great very cool you guys very very well done which the key to getting out of debt\nFor us I think it was doing it together first of all the also being willing to work very hard I work three jobs in worked overtime but um and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not stray from that in honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad because that was money that would be knocking out my land\nMhm mhm yeah I gave you gave your boundaries on a process you know what about you oh I think the\n... it was it was it was good I mean we we are working with a key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt you ain't gonna work\nExtra ... or the you raise your income over fifty thousand dollar Courtney finished a residency program that is huge for her I'm so she got a big raise and then\nYou know I Would I Would say call 'em and and be dispatch at the utility company and just uh the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime do it you know it it really helps the snowball just\nPlow through and go to the finish line\nYou know there's something about that because you're getting traction if you were working like that and you didn't know what if you're doing any good at it you you just be exhausted but it's weird how it's exhilarating 'cause you know you're winning ... you know you work your butt off when you're winning absolutely and it changes everything and now you can crank back down to a normal people hours now and not have to be so crazy but\nIf you want to go for something you know how to do it uses dolled up you know\nAnd both of you have great careers and the ability to do that\nSo very cool very proud of y'all thank you thank graduations so proud of you know ... years old sauce zing very cool\nOh we got a copy of course opens book for you retire inspired

Ramsey\nDave Ramsey dot com or know at ... dot com you can't buy blended they rented a room calling his owner that when you retire start making money from your investments is that income consider earn income or capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income\nUh that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or taxed on an ordinary income right if the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. where it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not raw it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out um all of the money will be\nA hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those\nIf you have investments simply invested in the piece of real estate you don't pay any taxes until you sell it and then you pay taxes on capital gains portion you own investments like a a mutual fund or a low turnover mutual fund\nYou'll have no taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have capital gains if you failed it over a year\nCan check your tax guy this is that I've Ramsey show [noise]\n\nIt's time\nTo take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure

you if you could save some cats\nThings that I use my own personal life to grow and to improve and reach my goals I read books to grow I Will use work books if I'm doing a devotional or Bible study I have to do list and I use a journal to write down goals and the calendar and a calendar\nHow can we pull all of these pieces together into a planner that connect those dots so for example in January we sat gold and then we talk about what we actually\nPut those on the counter than we put them on the task lists and you begin to see\nHow those goals you set in January really can carry through the entire year and and the way that bill today was like I Would have coaching session so I have questions in there for a reflection and activities to work through so if I was sitting down with your coffee these the questions I Would ask you to help you get to where you want to be so it's really fun and then every single month\nHas a different topic in teaching to help you grow and this is kind of like a complement to the business boutique book it's almost like a work\nBut that helps you put it in Russia last a month of August is taking care of view yeah and then you've got questions when

see out there in these really nice\nUm journals or a devotional plans or whatever and you you combine some of those and it's got extra things in it that some of them don't have\nAnd um I didn't

Fifteen months ago and he's done a pretty big contract but they ... into work and like ... and critical I think if they can buy [noise]\nAnd so we're trying to hire anybody but we're not having a hard time finding that in my lab or have an industry that as it usually regularly to hire\nThe how can we get it's hoping I can ... the one way that we can actively fight reliable and get people to be a part of it slow and like ... or\n\nYou don't know any painters that are good and a lot of people we do know cannery um that are good I mean people\nAt a party there hasn't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people oh well we do have that they have their own acted as well mhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own businesses\n[noise] ... yeah okay we're we're trying like we we play that I have black and nobody's responding to it and so I just we just don't know where to look in order to get well\nMost of the turnout would rely lay people run around with good reliable people yeah\nAnd most of the time do pushes run around with due to ... so usually when I'm really good reliable people I look around other good reliable people not\nCould be that you look and some of the other trades and you know one what tradition that's a good person or a trim carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who did they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem they jot as you're in a very very hot construction market in Denver and so everybody's got work even do fishes\n\nAnd your has your husband's got my working hand on maintenance show that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage or when you've got a construction but I'm always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know and it is an apple in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that is a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we'd go on like you've done websites you've gone Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers great painter isn't or the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry that's a great person will no somebody's right developer and send them our way and of course you're going to pay them\nAnd pay them well and\nI'm a ... paying a ... doesn't make them anything except that will pay ... so\nYou you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people ah sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want it to work here in another area\nNow we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a

further looking into it they're all for ... for fraternities um and our for eight different fines and kind of confused of every three thousand dollars\nOf my money how much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nI'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nSo I'm looking at um it's a ... a different side of names and then it says forfeiture earth and it has a bunch of negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars that's a yeah I thought I thought especially when it was only you know a small four one K. to begin with\nA really um did you roll it was a smart goes to a pro\nI rolled it over into a previously on another IRA had already event\nSo you don't have an advisor I don't care I'm\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer to your question I've never mind that the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds or hoppy mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously okay but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they will

my\nEmployer is going through open enrollment or our health insurance benefit and I'm kind of on the bed I'm hoping that maybe you could kind of helped me ...\nUm they've introduced a high deductible a program with an H ... which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide that I keep my traditional PBS plan or should I jump on board with his high deductible plans\nAnd how much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium all the eighty to ... pay period they calculate to about Twenty one hundred a year and what about the other one the other one will be around thirty four hundred a year okay thirty\nFor hundreds of Twenty one hundred she'll Thirteen hundred dollars for him\nAnd how much is the doctor will only that\nOkay so on the PBS show it will be four hundred per individual or the PPO and for the high deductible it's Thirteen fifty per individual but there is a twenty seven hundred for the family\nYou know and how how uh how old are your kids my kids are ten and Thirteen are there any um ongoing illnesses\nVersion but the doctor will hop into well I'll say like why am I right now we just hit that adoptable at one of our family members emergency about it in a year so I said\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your surfing hundreds savings versus the risk group\nWere fairly healthy we don't usually run through the ... so the hot adoptable lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it\n\n\nGet asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now life insurance is not part of the baby\nInsurance was not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide for their financial aid that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\n... over this ten years so now that you are the coordinator those paid off\nTheir house people look at you like wow yeah my hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um\nAnd small steps add up to a giant staff at the end you know\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the ... um what's really court I mean where when we started I used to routinely saying like while we're driving in church like boys what we're give what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that\nI'm just slowly over

last year I I went back to work for one year and it all of my income went towards a mortgage because it was about fifty fifty thousand laps and we just just piled on every month it was like you just kept counting down month by month we're going to make it and it was\nIt was off it'd be you wouldn't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculate knew it was just for a year now they're talking to this year we are done by them so I'm In for a year yeah and you can embrace a year of pain so by then you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe that\nYeah I I mean we were under water on her mortgage for about three four years for\nMe it was like when we uh oh it as much as what the equity was um then it's like started

mix Sally they swear it off on everything from health care to immigration in the Senate debate but really\nIn a few minutes we'll talk about the last minute language debate because that's what everybody's talking about it was a grenade was loved by mix Sally [noise] but [noise]\nI got to tell you it throughout most of this debate [noise]\nIt was pretty boring I didn't get a whole lot out of it I think that if you're an independent maybe you know you've got something out of it I'm an independent [noise]\nI'd like to both ladies to be honest with you both will serve well in the Senate no matter who wins um but I think it's really up to the independence of fuel Republican and you watch this you're still like with Sally if you're a Democrat\nAnd you watch cinema you're still voting percent of what does the independence and the ah isn't that what the debate was all about who was done for the independent well big\nSally stuck to her script and that is in ... I guess engaging the base not necessarily independence but Senate much stuck to the script of I'm curious in cinema I'm for Arizona I'm not a Democrat but you didn't mention that you get to her independence streak or whatever but the big news is or or the big takeaway was big Sally said\nYes Trump's coming friday but we're going to Luke air force base so now the president is going to be it makes a gateway in the east valley and he will take a tour of Luke air force base in the west valley traffic is going to be on that for\nShark question no answer\nJim sharp solid question today Arizona's morning news David Garcia we cancer we shouldn't be surprised do you think it's fair\nThat some some of them are kind of great but a little bit that maybe you should have tried a little harder to says this is not about effort our team and myself who put significant effort in fact I Will tell you I think Arizona and I put a lot of effort into our campaign which you were talking about is outside money ... that's what you're talking about\nNow that he's actually not so I always David guard Garcia is great at not answering the question I don't know if he doesn't want to answer the question or he doesn't know how to answer a question but I'll say it again a gym short made a great point he said hey listen\nI've got some Democrat friend and then there are a disaster yeah they said uh what about his effort raised effort not at the Arizona and effort right right right it's not about money\nSo David Garcia just doesn't get it and I'll say it again one of the weakest democratic gubernatorial candidates I've seen in twenty two years in Arizona that's how bad he is and I'm with Jim sharp on this one I of democratic friends who weren't voting for this guy and they are way left\nAnd they still won't vote for Garcia they think the guy's campaign is a heap of absolute hot garbage so I think he's going to get so what are they going to vote for they're going to vote producing really are going to vote for a while and I was shocked to rise that shows you how bad David ...\nAnd number three story on the all Arizona daily download home\nPlay that out not yeah if you've seen these dying around other Arizona a possible I said look I'm You're welcome\nYeah you did a good job Martha that say that belt yeah well we like putting the people in the news a in a situation\nOr if you've seen these lawn signs directing you hold me for Senate my wife and I saw this over\nHe was not brought up mix Sally was hoping it was going to be brought out right it was not brought up and it's like\nWell you know you wanted her to or you think that makes Sallie did it to get sent him an offer ... guy and I think\nCinemas reaction infuriated mix Sally because cinema was so calm so nice so collected didn't look at them and mix it makes\nYou know so she loves the treason bomb and gets no react I didn't see I thought it was just to get it out\nThere well it was that's true too but the reaction I think is and what makes Sally wanted so you're right last ditch effort by mix Sally to put this out so to maybe get in my opinion a reaction out of cinema or to at least you know get somebody talking about it because it wasn't brought up so what the heck are we talking about\nWith here since cinema trees in two thousand three radio interview here since ...\nThis is what makes Sally was talking about when she heard the trees and ...\nI Do think that those of us who who are privileged to have more and do something to others I\nDon't know what I mean I don't buy more me as an individual if I Want to go fight\nIn the Taliban army I go over there or not you know I'm I'm fighting for the ... I'm Sorry that's personal decision and I asked I Want to do in World War two and I want to join our area and you know fight the Germans bomb in London as an individual I have no problem you can do whatever you want with your money not mine but I\nThink what we're what we're talking about here are two different phones and you're saying something to the world my definition of a sentence Ron does not involve wind distractions\nSo after you hear what happened in two thousand three cures to send them a radio interview Taliban all that kind of stuff do you think Sally is right cinema ... veterans including mix Sally an apology because that's really what we're talking about that is what it was about yesterday and that's what makes that we wanted from cinema Mm\n[noise] I I Know I I didn't take it as she was insulting people she was just trying to get this\nLoud mouth AM talk show guy for just be like ... whatever dude that's not what I'm Talking about I did not take it as a slap and veterans or any reason is I didn't you know ... in treaty I took it as whatever I don't see it that way but if you want to do it go ahead and\nUh the only the only I'm telling you the the the only uh people that this plays well with his people that are already voting for mix Sally [noise] if you want to be able to get anybody know mind was changed well no no\nI don't think independents are going to look at this and say yeah I can see that send them as a ... is is a treasonous person\nI just don't think independents are going to do that I think if you\nAre Republican you know the majority maybe uh I don't know not all of you but the majority of say yeah that cinema she that she did commit trees and ... to go and fight for the Taliban sent me very dependent you're gonna do you're going to decide this election I just don't see independence buying any of that ... they're not they're not\nThey're not and again Mick Sally has stuck to her guns about riling up the base right I don't think she's ever gone down the independent wrote or trying to get independent all goes back to my question of who does that\nRe Hervey and become a ... the ... got him while it doesn't matter what this is ... this is a crowd of this is the bowl on top of the president or the cherry on top of the ...\nWhen you when you throw down the trees and an accusation you and then you've demanded an apology and she did demand yes she demanded an apology again after the debate last night\nAnd wouldn't let it go then today she puts out a statement\nThat she said you know I I Want an apology\nAnd then puts in a statement according to US Code the definition of treason and highlights is guilty and south ... south suffered death or being in prison no less than five years that is the far right you know with a dog whistle right there this is not going after independence and it's just and this is the only thing you've got ... cinema\nThat's the only thing that you can ... you know lobby to her I think it's a week wow it is\nI think most of this uh old audio of cinema is pretty weak\nOr ten years old yeah I mean if they said something really been the meth lab thing I didn't really like the cinema said I didn't really appreciate that but you know what did she also saying in twenty eleven that Arizona has some crazy Republicans no job\nMy goodness of course we have crazy Republicans we've crazy lawmakers some of them are Democrats some of our Republicans so she's right when she says that um you know I I don't I don't I don't care what you said in his two thousand three interview I I don't care if I don't think any ...\nIt's not standing up saying I Want everybody to please please pretty pleased joining the Taliban right until American Soldiers or Saddam Hussein had some pretty good idea if she's not saying that at All right\nOr or that guy in Syria that dictator Assad I I think he's okay I'd like to party with his oh wait a minute hold ghosts are actually said that Republican and he saw that I like to say that yes okay yeah let's see what we're doing here\nAll right so the last second treason by my by mix Sally ...\nNot affect it was more of a Dutch than an actual bomb coming up next the caravan of thousands of immigrants are traveling from Honduras\nRight here into the United states and Trump says he knows how to stop them but you're probably not going to like this idea next [noise] [laughter]\n\n[noise] Arizona is a battleground state in the upcoming midterm election\nPresident Trump will make a campaign rally stop in Mesa this Friday I Am\nWill
