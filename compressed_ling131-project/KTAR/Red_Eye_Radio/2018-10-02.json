[laughter] [laughter]\nWell I can say we're all end up on this big part to or not [laughter] [noise]\nWell I mean what you think about it if if Republicans are because remember that it's the it's the deficit issue that's going to sky rocket through the roof yes to over a trillion dollars in one year and we're not at war no it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not into recession throwing seven hundred\nA ... billion dollars that at the banks or\nAny of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats were able to take over both\nUh the Senate and the house and what was their number one what the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats won\n\nIf they're Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunk and sailors and but at least a drunken sailor is ... how did they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking offended they throw out ice on anybody\nGot it all relates doesn't it\nUh but how much would Democrats ... Republicans are ... are spending this much\nAnd and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care if there's no political pressure this will continue as I said this is this is my uh twenty ninth anniversary or this week of doing talk radio\nOr the first issue that we hit which was back in eighty nine was the whole clean sweep that Congress was spending too much money\nAnd it's time for a clean sweep and monarch forget the protests all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut back I think the deficit at that time was four trillion or less ...\n\nMaybe even three I care don't even remember what it was at that point ... but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets about the debt [laughter] [noise]\nYeah like an eight something to get them are marching in areas where are you guys marching for the debt who's that national debt oh by the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh\nUh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar gift year from the fed or get them every working American the the that's that basically is it is split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf\nBut remember in the tax bill last year mhm the only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes\nAre people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up yes because we're enormously wealthy exactly that's why ... ... as the one caller said\nA couple of years ago billion a billionaire yes\nWhich was a surprise to all of us yes keep it up\nI'll tell you this if I was a billionaire ... I'd get rid of the my Fifteen year old vehicle and has two hundred and ten thousand model oh yeah yeah yeah no I'd put that out what the trash [laughter] that would be gone my butler would I Would\nBut because of certain business ... and we both share or we can't take them anymore and therefore our our business did matter [laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset\nYeah we are actually looked at the tax by the tax thing was the right thing to do is we evolved in state of before a irrespective of the unfairness towards us other problems 'til the spending a and and that's what it comes down to be good because the the the physical product\nThe the fiscal policy\nUh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while all over the place especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially\nBut beyond that the fiscal policy\nBecome something very different because and this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides this will start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America\nAnd start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on\nAh this program this federal program and yours your child's school\nNo up start taking things away that's when people start getting motivated that's when they start\nPaying attention now they wouldn't they still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them are they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out and you are not welcome and that kind of policy is not walk there is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending\nAnd a number of issues that conservatives are watching and have been watching for ever enter important because they've always been important\nBut this is it\nAn Obamacare as one of those you know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something that somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one ... in California well we'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for\nThat's why even though you have when you have Jake Tapper CNN and and even Chris Cuomo\nQuestioning a case yo Cortez reality and Gail I'm In Florida and and and Gillum about you know the ... of Medicare for all the way they understand what we're spending right now how do you pay we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt audio ... you can't pay for all ... and pay or what we're paying for it today it's\nImpossible so the only thing you could do is put massive debt\nOn the ah on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up and how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know you know too late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens\nBut as we've said is immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolute immoral and unethical to be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stated before we found a loophole\nOf taxation without representation we found the loophole your tax the future they didn't vote for it they had no representation they had no say in it they're completely innocent and all of this\nAnd we have found the most moral way and we just hide our heads in the stands sand let's put it on them and because I said that I expect to get\nThe emails today which I always get whenever I said that oh you're exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in controlling debt is all part of it\nBad the lab ... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience by writing those emails\nWell because it effectively when it gets to the point that you can't even service the interest on the debt as a nation the massive hit to the economy when our global trade partners can no longer trust the U.S\nIt will be catastrophic in nature to say well we can just write it off on paper and start over\nNope no you can't\nBecause no one is going to trust doing business with you any longer and with that happens then are great show great grandchildren and their children and great grandchildren will not experience [noise] ah what the expansion of wealth\nAnd the freedom and liberty it brings to their families they won't experience that 'cause they only play there is going to have the government the federal government taking over more\nIndustry nationalizing industry eight six six\nNinety red eye books with what I told him that he ... he wrote a
