the cabin I'll Fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now right and and uh you don't make a great point in the never conservatives are the left by the way that it doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd and we have talked about how this has United the ... the Republican parties and the different factions and even the never Trump ... ... it has it has helped to unite them back to coming home to the Republican Party\nAnd a couple of things that they wrote here they said Democrats were so worried about Senate norms that they hid Mrs Ford's

and\nUh it says the media sometimes for us to be puzzled that more than ... percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal flaws\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason I mean the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their ... methods Republicans have figured out that if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man\nAs distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power sure Republicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false woods but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August call to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit voters know this\nIs about the less will to power by any means necessary Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the left hates them as much or more\nThan they load Mr Trump conservatives understand that\nAnd for the American left they're all deplorable ... yeah I think that's a I think that's a great piece and and right on target which is why you see I think more of a United front much more uh more United front than I can remember with Republicans in a long long time\nA ... here and it's more than just about this it is about the fact that they now understand how far the left will go what the left is about ... and that's it and\nAnd this is not something you usually forget there's what another five weeks are less than five weeks now before the election\n[laughter]\nSo we are to blame for nothing but important people won't listen [laughter] well we're all the way that we are to blame for this country is right now [laughter] I was always that our listeners are the most important people on the planet and and they are\nI'm Talking about the non politicians [laughter] All right and and the other the other breaking news and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of years\nA this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony\nUh uh yesterday by a you know a high FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon or has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee is private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... used you know they accused of the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original or a charge what we found out since that time was and nobody disputes what I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary\nClinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order\nTo uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump during the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it\nTo destroy the legitimacy of his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd so now we know that right before that\nThe FBI lead counsel met with the law firm Perkins Cooley that really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the ... the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign and we've got to the law firm\nThey were with the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right and my wife would\nCounsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question\nThe the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm that would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that is part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do as I say well as well as he says\nTo talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys\nNo it was attorneys and attorneys meeting so\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ...\nThe Democratic National Committee he's private law firm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy\nTo compile the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a Bible testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house you're just you're\nScary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect the dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and what's the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the size of court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed\nA Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins could we law firm\nAnd the FBI we bought in state of this I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah I'm going to accomplish season though you could\nDo probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because\nWe've always broken down and since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this [laughter] but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or changed because of change then to hack and or to change the outcome of the election and then reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones who colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump\nOn verified information still today and oh by the way if it's an verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after that I've ever over after over two years right so\nAnd and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that it was to destroy the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information that information and\nAnd ... well faking it as intelligent instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign is\nExactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump yes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party\nAnd all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole ... everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that is\nA it tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still\nRelevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's the problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhere do you think about it I can even applied to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right the longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story start falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains you know a note cooperation for these particular stories right\nThey they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats did would Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that\nThey actually could have kept her name secret yes now that we know how background checks for gun and they keep it secret they could have kept her\n... they could have kept her name secret now we know the process they could have done it and she chose not to and Feinstein made this thing move forward", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "04"}
