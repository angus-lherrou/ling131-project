Bush called for\nA some kind of a new immigration bill to clean up some of the mess that Ted Kennedy left back in the sixties we essentially had an ad in the uh any immigration reform to speak out from that time and uh\nUh the Congress drug their feet in ... on on this thing until actually after Brock Obama had already been elected but it hadn't been inaugurated in two thousand and eight\nAt the last minute in December or the lame duck Congress passed and immigration reform act\nAnd uh as it went through committee and in the weeks prior they just kept piling more and more and more garbage into this thing and George Bush signed this thing it was either eight hundred twelve hundred pages I read the entire but [noise]\nI and I read all the documentation that goes with dieting Feinstein had slipped into their section too overweight somewhere maybe uh three\nQuarters of the way into the bill\nOf the problem that ... that we have now they created so many of the problems that we have now\nAnd what it is is they can't just automatically send these kids back they can send their parents back up prior to the passage of this legislation a bear in mind I live in uh the the town where we train most of the border\nPatrol people okay the federal law enforcement training centers right here where I live so I take great anthrax and all this stuff oh in in the past prior to that two thousand and eight you know almost everybody who came to the border and made any kind of claim of asylum or anything like that\nThe border patrol agent on the ground and his supervisor and in extreme cases the supervisor above that supervisor made the determination\nWhether or not that person got the state it was never part to two thousand an issue of deportation from the federal courts or any court to become involved with\nSo George Bush signed this thing or as a lame duck leaving and you may remember George W voice was very soft on immigration I don't think he specifically like this legislation [noise] what\nDo you felt it was better than than what they had prior to that that circle certainly accomplished many of his goals\nAre ... are so many up this country tomorrow ... so that being said uh the regulatory environment that came out of that are out of that bill created all of this stuff that we've had since two thousand and eight\nSo for ten years we've been dealing with this I mean the only way it's probably going to get solved is for the courts to\nRecognize that not everything years for education that the ... at some point they're going to have to take the spirit of the law rather than their own individual\nRather than their own individual feelings into a into effect this past year olds they regardless you may be able to do that now that we have some members on screen court but I'm not even sure about that it may take another piece of legislation to solve this problem work", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Glendale", "day": "16"}
