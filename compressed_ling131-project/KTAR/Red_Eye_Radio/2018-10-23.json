mhm they can buy their\n... well if they got married it could be president and first lady you know\nI ah I doubt that's going to happen but clearly the it's always about buying the votes yeah you want to give away something you promise something for free I mean back in the day Hugo Chavez in Venezuela\nIf you if you uh don't remember Venezuela was a a a socialist nation now they're they're just uh the remnants of the socialist nation but in Venezuela they would send checks out in the mail before election day you know yeah it's always about well\nBuying look I I ... I think ... every every politician on boats on on both sides that looks at people's self interest way does it all depends what your self interested that's why I voted my self interest right I I vote for my self interest me much might [laughter]\nMuch worse my it it really didn't work out for me just last why shouldn't we since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan\nNo but what is my what is my bigger self interest my mind bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff\nNo my self interest is freedom\nWell when we have the liberty of it did and and the ... of of our nation\nRight that that's my number that's my self interest is a lot so people vote for their self interest all the time

about\nThe deficit or the debt either side now doesn't care about it it's completely and totally irresponsible both Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit\nDon't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo ... for both sides now keeping the status quo of what we have today is extremely important sure keeping the status quo of what we get\nFrom the government I Can't tell you when the banks were getting bailed out how many people called up and said there should be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money while from somebody else\nAnd that's where this shift was from you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservative or voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the uh the the end of the Bush presidency\nOr that the world was coming to Annette remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the\nCampaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world you know because the world is coming through with that uh but the that that a a fear drove a lot of people after the bailout started happening\nTo say well listen you know that's going to happen then great I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect\nRight the government money looting right idea I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money throw it to me not throw bank right to throw it to me and we were saying no throat which no one\nAnd and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands us when you take it out of the partisan taught\nThat's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands us when you take it out of the hardest and talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right sure healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats used to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for Ken Ken you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a we we live in a a a a time\nAnd you know already got response whenever we talk about health care well other countries spend less on health care\nNo they don't know not for the same services they don't know\nYou can't make that correlation you because you can't compare you can't you can't compare it if waiting times are double for some procedures that child care and ... exact timely healthcare is if you talk to my my my cousin out of Ontario mhm back Twenty years ago\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college mom um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center or being independent and look at this idea and go well well well that could work\nOr does it really effectively work with their particular situation\nAnd then on top of that or does that interests me is if I'm really think about a generation who is having fewer kids\nDoes the book or plan even resonate with them ... kids I I Know what about me I'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children\nBecause I don't really plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] thing is I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not oh wait a minute\nBut the thousand dollars doesn't help with raising my child now that's what I needed ... dollars a year I think that and help with raising my child cutting out that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're\nA disadvantage because they can't afford college were home and all this all these items\nWell no no no no no no you're you're not you're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there\nBut you know would be parents votes right now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she promised she made six thousand dollars if she gets a lot of it how would my kid ... I Want to end six thousand now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe come out with Harris comes adds onto it and says free college for everybody and she gets my vote too because she's going to include existing college loans and of course free healthcare yes Medicare failed to right yeah\nSo the what you can get me no ... or it and got my kid you're several thousand I Know I'm not having kids ... thousand Eighteen years from now no and and my kid gets it I don't get ... no no I'd rather get the six thousand dollars now\nAll the ways that will give me bolt will know give me the six to ... don't get me six thousand dollars give me Fifteen thousand dollars to raise my kids now right\nInstead of the fifty thousand dollars at my kid could use down the road right no I Want it now and gave me now gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme that then you're not\nTrying to get the vote of the the baby that's yet to be born you're trying to get the adult vote they don't care about the future they care about now see they're not thinking\nWe're ... we're trying to tell them Gary we can do the strategy for I don't know a couple of million apiece they're just not thinking you're either not going big enough or you're not going direct enough\nLet's go to William in Virginia William welcome you're on ...
