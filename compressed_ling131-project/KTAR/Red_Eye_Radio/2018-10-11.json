Virginia before it heads off\nA in the Atlantic but ah as a Tom and both the John ... told us earlier a ... and and they predicted this was a storm that was going to stay together it wasn't going to disperse and it looks like as we talk to Tom last hour he said all the way to Ireland\nUh yeah it's going to it's going to remain a that there's enough heat even in\nThe uh uh I guess central northern part of the Atlantic there's still enough heat to keep that together all the way across the big pond which by the way it'll it'll reach you know near Ireland and Great Britain Sunday yeah about a

uh yesterday looking at ... or the stocks are overnight everybody's taking a big hit\nA from a from Asia throughout Europe and also what looks like a that uh the opening looking at the Dow futures right now will be down you know maybe a couple of hundred points to start to start the morning we'll start it will start down\nA variety of different things uh it was interesting 'cause I was thinking to myself I'm not really surprised by this\nAnd has written the wall Street Journal and said investors really weren't surprised by this and I'm thinking okay well I don't put myself in their category\nBut just looking at everything that's that that has been going on things you know little signs up there that you and I've talked about when you see the ... and you see what\nYou know treasury bills we just happened to be talking about that last night right and and we were looking at at at how the the interest rates on treasury bills for the most part has doubled in a year that's just in a year\nIt has doubled that you know that means there's more money that the government has to pay out just\nA four interests you got the fat now are wanting to uh raise rates the story was out or did we do this on the air off the air about uh that uh because uh ... what we did it on the mortgages\nWell when you had delinquency rates are as as they started to creep up and up the forecast for that sky rocketed because of the rise in interest rates that was ultimately going to do those homeowners it was clear well if they can't keep up right now\nWell then what it balloons out with even a higher rate to a higher rate than uh than they had expected and plan for well all bets are off it's just not going to happen and that's that's part of that was part of the dynamics in place\nWell what you have here is you know uh the basically the fed going in and\nThe the point Kramer was making is that it was not Jim Kramer at CNBC in the street dot com was that he wants a more regimented and he wants them to do the homework on the economy he feels that the fed is not doing their homework\nAnd they should review the data because to his point what do we know about the fallout from terrorists what do we know about a long term effect\nUh you know you have ... ... e gene saying you know part of the the um the demand for from China has softened greatly and so part of their problem was not just the the the cost of materials and freight well or that\nBut that that Senate emissions from the administration that the economy isn't expanding as quickly as they are as they're selling and therefore we can't raise the interest rates in a way that's politically that's an admission that it's not going as good as it should right\nBecause if you were saying that you're raising interest rates um and it is regimented and and really has\nA you know a ... ... if your point is a ... ... ... have been ... that they should wait you know Jim Kramer saying it is one thing but at the point is being made that the the feds don't need to raise rates right now well you\nAre admitting you're saying that our policy is also affecting you have to admit that any policy by any governing entity is is affecting negatively right terrorists or whatever it might be right ...\nRegulation and taxes because that's what a tear if it doesn't matter whether you call it a terror for an income tax whatever if your tax if you're raising the cost of doing business it's always going to hurt well and\nAnd I will see in the coming days where where the market rebounds if they believe this has long lived if they if it's going to be long lived if\nIf they believe that the administration is going to do an about face on terrorists and and and the terrorists even in the situation with China because it's it's affecting negatively way too many producers here in the U.

I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot last last hour but you\nYou actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nA effect in Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it it's something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart over land and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants and again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling ah right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go where you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean\n... okay and and write is it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regained powers considered extra tropical but it's ... you're right in in nailing it here\nThe it it may not be the thirty day storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nWow it really is traveling and and and speaking of traveling up for those professional drivers out there and the high profile trucks I Know that are that are Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that are and they know if they're seizing driver they know\nA that those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will a kind of hug I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling on Ninety five need to be aware of\nThat uh because that as a main quarter of course between of Florida and New York well and um and then go ahead to some ... some ... ...\nBut to some ... some degree they're going to have the stuff that they're back the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five or twenty\nUh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up into Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington heads to Charlotte every one of those crossroads the ... I don't have a number four but the one from Wilmington\nThat that goes into Seventy seven through Florence all of those east west roads are going to have cross wins\nRight yes Tom where does this go on the record books\nAh it goes in the record books as the number three a storm to hit the United states\nWhile a and it it and it goes in the record book primarily because of intensity or low pressure at at nine Nineteen Miller bars um just beyond that position number four in the record book happens to be Katrina\nSurprisingly enough and then behind that cat five Andrew is number five in the record book but what I found really intriguing\nAnd we talked about this yesterday about continuing to grow as it moved its way ensure mhm\nAtmosphere was perfect not in the last hour it dropped from nine twenty two to nine Nineteen\nAnd it was deep and in an intensifying even as it was starting to come on shore wow I haven't seen that that I haven't seen that much of a change to begin with a three meal a bar drop\n'em and at the same time it went from one hundred and fifty\nAnd uh and that's what I found when I when I woke up from my nap after the the morning\nShow why [laughter] why they're opt out of [laughter] a hundred and\nFifty yeah why not\nAnd then it jumped to a hundred and fifty five yeah now the ten I'm as Kendall Airforce base yes right and\nA ten dollar as a radar and that radar was queer read as it was coming ashore at um I Believe it was clear he'd at five thousand feet or four thousand feet wind speed wind speed there are a hundred and Seventy seven miles now now\nNow that doesn't translate to the surface but it obviously\nUm there were probably there were easily guess over a hundred and thirty miles an hour and in this particular storm that made it down to the surface but that's just to give you an idea how powerful this thing is and again\nI have to thank all the people who ... went out there and report it uncovered this um\nAnd and I saw a much more professional manner of them covering it this time you know you may have noticed everybody in the weather channel that was out there had had their hand held Anna monitors this time\nYes yeah right\nYeah they didn't want to have anybody walking behind them with a grocery cart\n[laughter] yeah right [laughter] yeah\nKind of ruined the drama if you will because you know and and that's you know if you look at this for a storm eight carried on it carried all of its drama Michael came with his own drama\nOr it was there was plenty of it you didn't have to go\n[noise] make anything of it it was a storm that\nJoke for itself and its intensity uh coming up or we will ah ah the we will ... will let you go back and get a nap after we talked [laughter] bottom of next hour Tom and we'd greatly appreciate your work on this and and really putting everything into perspective\nOr as we a lot of people will still be doing in the in the coming days and weeks\nAnd I think you're probably included in that group so we'll we'll talk with you Tom and at the bottom of next out ... yeah I learned a lot of high definitely next\nHour will do timing and flash flooding\nYeah wow yeah maybe Ronald just Tom hill thank you and we'll talk to you at the bottom of the next hour eight six six Ninety run I [noise]\nThe Sixers are on the radio [noise] if you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles than registered joined the million mile club on line and run I radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThere's not much point in driving a fuel efficient truck if you have to give up everything that makes driving a truck great so step up to the extreme efficiency in the western start fifty seven hundred ... and get your top back the fifty seven hundred X e combines western stars\nBinds western stars extreme heritage with dinosaurs advanced engineering to significantly improve efficiency dependability in profitability find out everything that makes the fifty seven hundred ... awesome from your nearest dealer who you can find at western star dot com", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "11"}
