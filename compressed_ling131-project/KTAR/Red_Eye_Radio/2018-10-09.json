and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety\nOr ... one of the things I've heard over the last couple of days especially from the left\nThe legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now gone ... of course that's ... right\nAh it it it isn't I mean that's the ... when when you're lost for anything else to say that's that's what you say the only other thing as I've said I and I let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this is something Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice and I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme Court it's originalist versus liberal\nThat's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's the liberals who wish to put on judges who passed legislation versus not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation\nIt's originalist construction it's also been they've been called but originally ... who want to stick to the original text of the constitution and say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut same liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication but it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative the kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not change it changing the constitution is up to a or changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process ... and it's that simple\nAnd we need to as conservatives\nOr we need to and libertarians we need to promote that that it is we the people who are elected representatives that need to be making the law\nAnd not abandoning the constitution and having a judge's become legislators and we haven't explained that it up and so when I hear even in the ...\nSo when I hear even in the media on a consistent basis in once in a while I'll even split\nThe ah the most of the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or the friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat right right around Labor Day that was the friday had to buy into Labor Day we ... and ... and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about Russian collusion no it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and raised on a consistent basis and so I was looking at your earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week\nBecause it's been their old standbys is what they've always used them even though at the same time the American people have said we don't care yeah we don't believe those are the top issues we don't believe race relations\nOr the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well are you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to a certain groups\nOr or you know or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger ... I ... I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama\nAdministration I'll never forget it where we said\nAre they doing this on purpose\nDo they actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy because remember the economy and never had three percent growth the entire time with the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even in just a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time that you know what's what's the Democrats issue what are they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nLouisiana ... two thousand two thousand sixty\nDemocrats try some self restraint\nNow I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional [laughter] it was just right [laughter] yeah\nUh it's not certain the Democrats just want to read the parts of it because I actually started laughing during it or it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and pushed to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice capping off\nAnd the swap with Clinton era of positions Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on the his public duty is\nThis is more a than a interesting irony in peach been would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base\nAnd make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats have an alternative\nThey can set aside the president of the Obama years when the party sought to an act the most extreme agenda it could pass and instead to search for common ground with marginal Trump supporters\nDemocrats won't win over this most ardent Tea Party members they won't win over ... Christians or other committed supporters but a humble are more open approach could attract some of his peripheral supporters and weaken the resolve of his base\nDemocrats can support gay marriage without foreseen small business owners to violate the richest religious beliefs and participate in the wedding ceremonies\nDefend abortion without opposing the sorts of restrictions common in Europe including waiting periods and bans on mid term abortions\nFight global warming without making obsolete many Americans livelihoods and lifestyles expand access to health care without eliminating private insurance protect minority rights without condemning law enforcement\nLaw enforcement promote the immigration while protecting the borders value multiculturalism without removing all mention of God or the tradition of from the public square and an act modest gun control measures without stopping Americans from hunting and defending themselves\nHave you lost me now have you lost and you know already on the ... yeah okay\n[noise] that's not going to happen\n\nYeah I lost you when a while right after we started laughing [laughter] I don't think [laughter]\nWith all due respect to the governor no um you know a number one's not gonna happen no it's been a [laughter] and not going to have a number two is also not going to happen and that [laughter] it will never happen\nI'm no I'm\nWell it it can happen ... look we as we saw this after twenty sixteen we said this one Democrat because I find that fascinating I find the self reflection that the Democrats go through ... you know of and they've gone through it and if you were election cycles where they say\nOkay we we've we've got to reevaluate we we have to get outside of the Washington and here are ... we we need to we need to go into the heartland in she how people are really thinking yeah and they really said that's twenty sixteen we have to seriously reevaluated when they went in the complete opposite direction\nYeah lead opposite yeah they'd gone more in same now they've gone more authoritarian they've gone more a dare I say using the F. word\nOr with a fascist mindset out there while claiming\nThat they are the anti fascist yeah that's the most interesting point them\nYeah I'm ... and it's that's not going that's not going to change or what it was a couple of weeks ago when we basically kind of mind it out what would drive the ... the Democrats I'm Sorry the the far left liberals those that are really I mean then they're leading the party now\nI mean I think after the uh Kavanaugh's confirmation process we can we can say without a doubt that as part of the mainstream process now um but nonetheless what would bring them back what would bring them back\nAnd bring them too because you know the ... which is by the way the most insane part of um I mean we can\nWe can giggle at at a governor Jindal's you know a appeal if you will in the same way that we can discount Robert Redford\nA script and his message because I Would ask both of them\nBefore we talk about the same behavior of the left tell me what would drive them to come back from\nAs especially when they are they stopped and they can't get out of it it it just it's a never ending loop there into creating more victims\nBecause which ones are not the cause of it like this is this is what that's a great while yet read for once you believe that Trump is the cause of it from stop the cause of it he's the effect of it and and so\nTell me if you think that would change just to save for the sake of the argument I Know that Trump decided tomorrow to resign effective immediately\nAnd Mike Pence became president we\nWould have a beautiful whom by our world that's right everywhere would go back where being normal we couldn't by Michael Moore onto the show when we would have a love\nFest right um well case it yes right right he's sitting in your lap not mine [laughter] um\n[laughter] and\nSo we were going to be better chair I Want to make sure what are the only full but God was being there was Michael Moore phobic\nGo ahead yeah I don't know what I'm saying is we're going to need better chairs so and you can take that how you want I really don't care how you take it so here's a here's the [laughter] I don't I really really do\nWell our chairs are ... well enough that simply said they don't have they they can't handle the stress okay or not enjoy your that those which that go with that yeah oh yeah that's actually where I'm at actually true it was an engineering so [laughter]\nThat's that's what it was so here's the question if case it\nBecame president tomorrow do think it would change you know it would not\nHave John McCain were still alive and ran for president and won what a change no what they called John McCain would change yes he'd go back to being Hitler yes eight six six Ninety red\n[noise] white bug bore read I read\nIt's MORNING radio with a record ...
