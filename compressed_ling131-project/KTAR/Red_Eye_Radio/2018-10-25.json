latest [noise]\nHere on the events from yesterday the FBI said ah last evening that it had identified seven suspicious\nAddressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days it contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote\nThe bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA a former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nOr this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central mail facility was evacuated after employees\nFound a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported was addressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed waters that were similar to the five and a reference and its earlier statement the LA police department tweeted that its bomb squad had rendered the package\nAt the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we\nUh have a right now a again\nA the one thing that is\nThe latest that we uh have a right now uh again or the one thing that is a that I've I think uh everybody wants to know\nAnd then I re read it again and went on and it's not what they're saying right now that wasn't on the air to see a right and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the ... they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the\nSource said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about the suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way\nRight on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the Democrats are you know we're picking were well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't have any\nVery few very and when do we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to\nWe know what the authorities have told us already the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television yesterday saying well it looks like see what you got here and what you got here okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um\nYou can tell the like the label on the packaging that went to see Annette well we know it had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to\nCNN we can see certain things but in terms of the the bomb experts that Ron\nWell here's what it looks like it still doesn't tell us the facts what it appears to be and what it might be or what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me the most though is again the people the cry that the you know there are the\nUm there are the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness while at the same time they're ... their their behavior is the most divisive\nWhich is conference responsible for this and you have no idea who did you have no idea of the auto idea who did it and you're claiming you're against divisiveness\nYou're against it and you you have this kind of surety you're trying to proclaim and\nYou're being the most divisive in that moment\nAnd it's so obvious and they seem to be completely and totally clueless are unaware that it's like I'd die you're just saying you're against the divisiveness yet you are committing the ultimate scent of divisive is like blaming somebody and\nYou don't have any of the facts you don't know what the facts are and you've already come to a conclusion of who's to blame if that is the ultimate and being a divisive media outlet tell us where we're wrong

I I Will say that that's all I mean\nWith if you look at the the issues that they were concerned about most in that at a uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday ... that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so\nIt is something we ... we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice here's interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it\nEven if you're not a farmer a noted on ... yeah right wow you know but you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they bring very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former ah you know again depending on the impacts they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know we'll see if if that point works or if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it's\n... I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was\nI'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her you heard her say she approve this message this is her campaign that she's not saying\nThe people that are protesters she's referring to her ... her party\nAnd we have to point out that we've pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members of the party that she's referring to here in terms of the word crazy\nThat's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know uh you know with my my party in it ... approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation and say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly it was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad\nRight where the momentum they believe mind\nThe crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad\nRight where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah because I think what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're there they're looking at holy because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme of something is is a term the Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah\nBut this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\n\nOr that are Democrats that can be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races and other states but especially\nOf course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's or maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest\nAccording to the polls right now the latest polls we so that's the effect is that come out with Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the ...\nThe state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point a Kamala Harris or you know inside with as young crazy Democrats she as she just did as having us [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote up and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThan it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote sheet condones that behavioral Lenny we saw it during the cop Kavanaugh process\nAnd and that's ... I'm I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy but talking about the undecided independents right you're undecided independent\nWho's looked at the cabinet thing and said they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back\nFrom that ad may be received by these people just say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy\nThat you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them\nThis just shows you the lame that you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with\nThat vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning\nTheir behavior not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it all just prove that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much stand there regardless\nThey're coming to that conclusion yes have it all just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much and they're recording the\nRadio [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you buy a freight line or trucks\nCobra electronic describe to support the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink travel centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty ninth LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right then CB\nRadio is helping to save lives from breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal activists for every radios old who was making a donation device thinking the fight against cancer the right to see the\nRadio is available for a limited time exclusively a travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nOwner operators we know everyone has flatbed for a few days to make the best for your business in Mercer transportation help you take advantage of that freight with no company trucks Mercer is committed to our owner operators success we have fast pace over forty years experience and opera dedicated coordinator unhealthy manager at all\nSo you can focus on running your business if you're looking to make a move considered Mercer transportation rock solid owner operator driven for over forty years visit today at Mercer town dot com or\nDid you know that studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lack the same access to health that other Americans enjoy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Glendale", "day": "25"}
