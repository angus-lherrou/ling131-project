tell you one of the things that I find fascinating is that you know the the the the call for unity in the end of of divisiveness\nWhich of course you're never going to have in politics or you know the the president has been criticized you know that uh well he uh after you know the the uh mail bomb scare and the uh the temple mass murders\nThat you know he went on to you know continue with you know what politicians do which is coming up to the midterms you go after you know your your political opponents\nAnd you go after them and the call I just was laughing yesterday that the media was talking about the fact that you know the president's still device if he goes after his political opponents or we need unity\nEvery president calls for unity zero presidents presidents get\nUnity\nDo I have to go any further it's it never happened every president calls for unity every person calls for unity and then they go out and they do what\nThey express what they believe and they're roughly half the people agree and half the people disagree as soon as you have an opinion you have created a divisive atmosphere how stupid are we\n\nHow stupid is the media\nRather not stupid there they believe that it gets to their advantage but every politician calls for unity and as soon as you open your mouth and say here's what I'm going to do a significant portion of the population\nDisagrees with you [laughter] it is impossible for a politician to create unity in a country\nCan we move on now\nYou are we going to are we going to continue living as fairy tale world well the president should promote

eight six six Ninety read I was just looking at a Fox News article from Newt Gingrich a and remember they contract with America that that he'd come up with a he's talking about the fact that they\nAnd remember they contract with America that that he had come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with 'cause he's talking about now proposed Republican pledge on on on healthcare you and I talked about this a long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember healthcare is one of the leading issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it is their fault for not solving the problem of health care and not going in with the plan right and he talks about you know a a a pledge that you know that that they that they should take\nA and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do and they should have had this a long time ago I Believe you when I talk about this a long time ago when they pat you know they they got rid of the individual mandate pass a little bit but we said look the premiums and everything else is going to come back to haunt them right if they don't do something and this could cause them\nOr the or a six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passes stored VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans in short term limited to ration plans so they go through them there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go through the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states\nThe states make a decision as to what they wish to do right and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates that limited choices the drive up costs for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation they go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan should should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this ... this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it out and this is two days ago it's too late\nOh yeah yeah it sounded like it's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all\nIt's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with a Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about in twenty sixteen\nAll of the we're going to do away with was Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will do away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the\nSome of the Obama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course than a undid the funding mechanism\nAnd then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're seeing and we've we've talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen\nAnd the end of last year\nNow you have this this whole new cycle and and whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you know about the public sentiment and they do know what\nThen why wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich did\nAnd and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it that ...\nRyan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it that's why because it's one of the top issues than Americans care\nWhile because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the Senate by the American people is is shifting on health care and this and this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now this is what they're telling us this is what they want this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing the party didn't have well any desire to do\nThe new Congress wrote it because you saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way we got criticism we got criticism we got criticism when we sat there not repealing Obamacare right stop saying it we ... we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they were just they were what were they were doing was really what\nThe mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right and so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately there should have been the president\nAnd and and this is why we have said that we know that people loved the rhetoric but it's about the winning and it's about getting things\nIt's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all so we don't have a monopoly running our health care system of government monopoly running our healthcare system\nAnd this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just sent me whatever and I'll sign right because the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any keep fighting\nYou know a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks the with the like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical mhm you've got to take the hardy shoes\nAnd one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nWell and and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that ... that he clearly understands that are within his real house like taxes because he's a businessman but you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns\nThe number one thing that this president did as candidate was do what we do have knowledge well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I Do but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation a no Donald Jean what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the\nRight now the burden on employers and hospitals that's the problem you have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved\nThis president easily could point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up\nAs a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that\nIs one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to curb what they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now is choking in hospitals it's choking employers\nAnd as a result who was it that pays the American people in premiums and so you\n... and ... and ... and and when he got out and in payments to the insurance company\n... and and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult\nYou know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't in his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care is well within this we'll hot and\nI ... unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for\nAll right well and then that case he's going to have to start talking about it yeah 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done\nIf that's what you thought\nRight well and then that case she's going to have to start talking about it yeah 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done because if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that's one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore held let's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when we really didn't ... that was the cry and then the president probably had to admit no well no we did\nGet rid of all the bottom of care but I mean but that's ... by the way that is part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bait that's part of the problem that we had with the right\nAmount we should look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I just you know we didn't know and people would argue with this why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy costs is coming from the regulation that is still in place hospitals employers\nAnd by what you know those those policies and plans have to cover and who pays that we do\nWe're still paying the cost yeah H and we continue to matter what six Ninety right I [noise]\nEight six six Ninety radar on radio [noise]", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city":
