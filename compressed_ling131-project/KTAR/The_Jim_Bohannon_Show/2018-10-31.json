you recommend voting Fifteen Percent into retirement I work for the local fire department and I have a pension plan do I need to say Fifteen Percent over and above that\nOr count that as part of it well\nWhat I tell folks is that you need to put Fifteen Percent and most of the time and a pension plan you're not putting in anything\nAnd\nYou don't have any control over what happens with a pension plan you don't choose the investments you don't get to um you know if the ... municipality in your case is poorly run they could break the pension plan\nIt's happened before doesn't happen very much but um no I think\nYou need to be voting Fifteen Percent of your income away in\n... four one K. is whatever you got to do along those lines and and that's the thing I Would tell you that the reason is is that what you've got that's money you choose where to invest it\nAnd if somebody mishandled something at work it doesn't mess up your four one K. it doesn't mess up your Roth IRA you are controlling your destiny are not waiting on someone else the people you work for it affects your life\nThat's a big deal Johns in Pittsburgh hey John welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHow are you today better than I deserve what's up\nI'm good I'm reading and I'm calling is here's my question uh my wife has sixty five I'm sixty two were just now into getting on the on the snowball we have a ... a month she saved up mhm\nBut we're looking for a new place to live the house when you rent right now is just way too big for my wife and I got bad knees bad back mhm up and down the stairs opinion about all the time okay um my question is\nUm the rentals around this area and now are skyrocketing because there's new cracker plant going in so people are coming in from out of state sucking all those up [laughter] [noise] but I found a couple of houses that I could purchase and the pay my rent right now eight Seventy five a month or my payment was dropped\nThis is that I could purchase and the pay my rent right now eight Seventy five a month or my payment would drop to about six hundred thirty dollars from up mhm\nI'm the other part of it is [laughter] a when I retired from the post office I rolled mine a push savings plan into an IRA good\nThat I can borrow enough from right now with that I already just be able to put towards ... percent ... ... on the house so I wouldn't have to pay the ... ... you know just\nLike you know when you're ... the American idol ... percent\nNo you're you're you're turning your two broke to buy a house you're in debt okay you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining at every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and house substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying market is squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization by out of order\nI if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do I would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine ah for a short period of time\nThat while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchase\nBut uh when you buy a house in your broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bring his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse rather than a blessing\nSteven as in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI Want to know what would be a martyr to do it right now I have a higher rate and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yes or no hypothetically at me and my wife only had\nThat my mouth that amount of money five thousand five hundred to go toward the exact thing whether it be smarter to put all of it into my rock IRA is or should I open up a rock for my and my wife's name and I flipped the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch it go that way\nWhat's your household income or a household income and fifty thousand okay Mm\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step forward into retirement\nIs more like a ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nOkay so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter\nUh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual\nFund and you put three thousand in more than three thousand and another okay one and not one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or or um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same\nSo it doesn't matter\nA hill I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up ... ... ... five hundred in my name and five and her you know the guy that exactly\nIt doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever the only advantage is just a relational in that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not got anything for retirement which\nIs not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else\nShe's going to get half of that money even if it is and your name okay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just want some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's baby step for\nAnd that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ...\nWhich may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of that and after having emergency if I went to the folks temporarily not to save for retirement till you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent of way\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth IRA for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred thirty seven or fifty bucks each\nAh that'd be fine or if he did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nThank you for taking my call sure what's up\nThey shouldn't ... Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I are planning to home next year and or had trouble deciding or or agreeing on our house we don't want to get in Atlanta and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn\nLearn how to do those our parents myself mhm and she wants to move on ready house\nMhm okay and uh be your first home\nThey are sick at all we've had a house for a while ago\nAnd then we moved in with an rent printing well over a year now you know the other home that you had was at a fixer upper it was not it was ... ... ... and um so what is her fear\nIt's just a we have to cook it you know and so it's kind of a hassle Amanda how ... I didn't want anything major just out this a minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nAh financially I think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay I see what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't\nHave to do that I got you I'm a part\nTime real estate and I live in a house for two years and then turn around and sell it\nI can sell it tax free\nShowed her anyway Adam I though you could sell attract free anyway\nTough to be a real estate I show how facts where you first residents would be limited to your factory growth on that anyone for anybody [noise]\nI don't think there's a I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this is just a question of what you guys want to endure it is your home we are homeless topsy turvy because it's being renovated all the time\nI get home and we have some valid point on her you're not going to make as much money on it to your point so it's a valid argument [noise]\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches or being reported every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked\nYeah but are you healthy\nYes I Would take it as no survivor give more by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you it's a better deal going on her take all the money or you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because that's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good you're in good shape\nAnd you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\n\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal cars normal just sucks okay you got it way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life\nFor the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I\nWould you know how you can do it you couldn't do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I've thought about it for the health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nThink this is not driving this for me for what's driving it for me you don't have much money\nRight and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are\nYou know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThe problem I've got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if\nThat's the problem we got here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being a live and we can figure out how you could live without a million dollars or mutual funds just becomes like a no brainer\nInstead you're not like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe which grape everything together episode overall properties and\nYou know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what might what I'm thinking is an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK I'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing\nIs and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really\nFun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you didn't joy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and health insurance as part of the day I don't care if you're working for somebody else you start a business but just to show them what you're doing out and make your smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you ... you know and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\n... to humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do not plan on work and it's not 'cause I Need money are only the money I got ... years\nBut uh I'm working because I have a vast you ought to find something like that and then you can work and hunt and fish and worked in the hunt and fish and farm and you know but but\nYou know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's what that's the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there's something you could do more than a vision that\nA lot of people are by this law you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out of the stage for the encore that's what the encore careers and a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nShow is not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more ad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you\nKnow we all need still that's what I'm saying

and demand with some considerable thoughts and observations to make about the political process including recent remarks\nMade by Nancy Pelosi in New York City the of course the house minority leader and she hopes and some polls suggest you might be once again the speaker of the house\nNow it's hard to know exactly what Nancy mean sometimes sometimes you just a little goofy a are referring to of course the famous quote about Obamacare we're just going to have to pass it to find out what's in it or to what extent do you believe this could have been the rhetorical rambling on the part of ... below sea\nWell no I think I think what she did is give a window to her soul I think you know you brought up Obamacare the fact that she and her party\nBasically we're willing to pass this massive bill without having read it and we're basically engaged\nIn a a a propaganda campaign to fool the American people at least a portion of them into supporting this American people were told by the president and by the Democrats that if they like their doctor they could keep their doctor\nThey might remember that eat Italy yes they\nWere told that their premiums would go down I don't know if they ... expressly discuss deductibles but I Know the American people were not\nTold that their deductibles would go a phenomenally um higher to the point where the insurance was almost worthless which was the situation with Obamacare and and of course\n... I don't think the American people were honestly told that what they were engaged in was nationalized saying I'm a significant industry when as if they you know health care system in the United states\nIs similar to the legal system in the United states it has lots of problems are legal system has lots of problems ... and the health care system has lots of problems but when we compare it to other parts of the world\nWe thank God we have it because it's the best in the world right well that that the\nBasically the system was demonized\nUm man that was up there were just a lot of ... going on in order to change it again the enjoyed advised the means the whole thing was like that so Nancy Pelosi is engaged in that\nAnd I think this has been the strategy if the Democrat Party we look at ... you know the terms looming we have a series of candidates who are posing as something other than what they\nAre yes we've been hearing a number of things about people uh most notably a Christians and some of the from the Arizona Claire McCaskill from Missouri are quoted in recordings they didn't realize were were being made to order at least made public in which they indicate there are a lot

and out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nI I think\nThere for them that I'm Sorry you're kind of skipping in and out what was that last comment David and then I Want our guest to comment\nI I think we need a hold of statements or the or the Congress up there to put this on their forehead so that each of them can read it and says are a little respect would ah tore each other if you want respect you have to give birth\nYeah well there's certainly that's a that's a would be nice to add I think at this particular time your thoughts James ... about the the tone of the political rhetoric of the day\nYeah and I think that sums up what David is trying to say and that's something I think all Americans would like to see 'em a little more decorum and dignity among each other but basically\nYou know with that the kind of commentary this collateral damage commentary Hillary Clinton saying you don't have to be civil um and the\nThe basic um atmosphere I brought up the Kavanaugh hearings to see these mobs of people and they are ... percent that caused you know the president come up with the slogan jobs now ...\nWould rather brilliant by the way but it

we were talking about a political party that has made it their position not to accept the results of an election\nUm they've they've tried every way they can with their allies in the media to essentially not only undermine the president but to remove him from office using governmental agency so and it's all failed\nAnd yes there there are any mental state\nOf kind of the uh the dealing

what I radio eight six six Ninety red eye he is or hunting I'm Gary McNamara [noise] you know we spent the first hour the show talking about the fourteenth amendment than birthright citizenship and\nAnd all that you just made an interesting point here because we we had gone back and and as others have been and you know did the research of the original writing of the fourteenth amendment and the senators were involved in actually writing it\nAnd you just made the great point here during the top of the hour you just are in our Mitchell meeting when you said\nWell we because we talk about the citizenship clause which was authored\nBy a a U.S senator from Michigan and his name was Jacob\nPower and during the debate of the fourteenth amendment he described it he actually talked about the intent of the citizenship clause\nWhich was to exclude a it would exclude Native Americans who maintain their tribe a tribal size and persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nAnd when you look at that because historians have gone back over this\nYou have a lot of legal scholars right now saying well no because it didn't get specific\nWhat do you we often go to legal precedent and everything else and certainly go this is not exempt from that they will cite legal precedent um but there is no greater in my opinion there's no greater legal precedent\nThan the description of the intent by gets offer the clause\nHad an author who was very vocal during the time of the debate about the intent of that clause there is no greater president\nSo we can go back and talk about our founders well what they intend to what they are and we don't always have on record ... you know the the the the bought behind a what our founding fathers\nOccurred you know the the the the thought behind a what our founding fathers set up for us now we go back we have the debate and I think you know the interpretation has been of a ... in terms of\nMany things are but in terms of the constitution\nOf a a a great debate back and forth because you don't have well here the notes\nThat's what I if you were to ask me I don't agree with it but I think that's what will happen mhm [noise] yeah or or the ... or ... decides to say\nUh that the president cat effectively change this through executive order that this would have to be an act of Congress to change this it would have to well it would have to be I mean what would they would have to be an act of Congress or would have to be a ... another ... under under an amendment yeah I'm ... it's I guess\nBecause at that point now you're approaching interpretation or them essentially having to interpret\nAnd and the fine at the highest level the fourteenth amendment and and really outline who would applies to whether or not it applies to the children of illegal aliens\nAnd then you'd have to go to the Nineteen fifty to a a part of the immigration naturalization act like a section I Believe it's I'm just memory fourteen or one has renewed earlier that the word Congress said okay you know we ... this is this is the law does Congress except with you know the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty two of the justices to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship that it didn't include it in any Congress person or anybody who uh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up\nBecause as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be done as to why Congress did that in Nineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if ... were to decide to define who would applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to define clearly in and decision I don't think this was going to happen but if they were to do that would that normal fi\nThat law from Nineteen fifty two\nIf it is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment\nOr the citizen oh it was all day to fourteenth amendment is clearly defined it if the if the Supreme Court heard it and the Supreme Court said no here's what it says then the what Congress did in fifty two would be gone that's what I mean oh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that ... that law also right that they could one one fell swoop\nAnd and that's the interpretation which means that there's much you can let you have to get past that part and that is what I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't think that that's I don't think they're going to get to defining a very clearly what they based on interpretation who the ... look at us ship clause applies doing who look it up a\nGun lawsuits over the last ... probably a a you know two hundred and forty years of the country and the two hundred and Thirty years before Congress irks me for the Supreme Court finally saw the second amendment as an individual rights ... it took that long right even though to me it was absolutely clear that it was an individual right\nAs it was to many of us because we knew what the founding fathers thought go back to the federalist papers and you can figure that out quite easily and still it wasn't defined for over two hundred and Thirty years and eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I told ... wrote a [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable

concert tickets on line [laughter] you know you ask yourself okay is there anything because millennials aren't stupid if they want to go to a concert or something oh man boom they pull up the up a boom boom boom boom they've got tickets right\nOh voting oh no no mailing things gives me anxiety\nOr who rode along his report that\nThere is a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas and we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress eastward slowly today as the front becomes more pronounced will see the showers extend into Dallas in central Texas\nWith some heavy thunderstorms likely for the architects today\nA so an act of Congress can certainly be changed and overruled by the court\nNotified by the court also yeah so what ... you know if if if you if you had Congress come out\nToday and and pass a law standing look you know that the Nineteen fifty two law was just\nAn you know an assertion that that we believe in the fourteenth amendment but we as Congress do not believe that the fourteenth amendment covered birthright citizenship that's up to the Supreme Court\nTo decide because we don't clearly see it in the in in the text\nAnd we believe that you know and and you you pass this law and so we we you know we either we either pull that Nineteen fifty law out or we amend the Nineteen fifty law\nTo include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that and I I don't think you'll ever see Congress do that I'm saying they could do that for a and and then at that point\nThe the courts would say well Congress is looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario because it's not going to happen but I'm saying they could do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to different safe now sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion and Nineteen Eighteen Ninety eight even though it wasn't a precedent that was that\nIt was an opinion the opinion lean that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah they could do lower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is\nAnd this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system\nI Believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a a law that clearly is that how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly\nNot being viewed by modern society as the makers\nAnd the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators that voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did for they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah a lot of federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was state precedent to their the Supreme Court came in and said sorry\nUh owning a gun as an individual right yeah yeah yeah\nThank you Scott we appreciate it I because yeah that the\nThe\nArgument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou'll hear that if if they were to take this case if the if the let's just say this were fast tracked\nUh the the president issues the executive order it's challenged and gets right up to the Supreme Court and and quick fashion or in the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact\nBut the impact remember is on would be on on on children that would be born to aliens and in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even the we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point to a parents who were here illegally that's not going to a ...\nThe legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point\nTo a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply that's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children born in the future to illegal parents\nAnd that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there that is that is not immediately affected right\nUh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban well you and I had to go back and screamed the word temporary how many different times because the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was you know again it was played out and ended in a different\nIn a different way the media but it's not going to it's not going to it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future\n... but I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never settle with Congress has never or there's never been a push to change the way in Congress the way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that just was not a legal precedent\nThat was set that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have judges even construction is judges\nEven cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say well there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over a fight going on constantly for that\nAnd constant president being set on that on birthright citizenship maybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about a specific type of behavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law in a different state\nAnd they might look at it and say this is pretty clear that the interpretation whether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken an accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought\nIt's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed the back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their opinion of the Supreme Court\nAnd a lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe\nThe country has come to a consensus of rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what they would that's what I see where I think it's going to go ... and it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any\nUh you know any republic any constitutional republic where a lot can be passed it'll be vegan somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged well and and that's\nThat's what I Would say that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge but it's never a new challenge me is that no one has ever stepped up to travel I I agree I agree with you on that is why I took two hundred and Thirty years to get\nYou know that guns are and and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in this country yeah every Eighteen Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of right what about the parents who aren't here right now but\nThe opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that ... made the claim that they are writing that every court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever\n... challenge that and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing even at that point you can be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it's stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically mhm that's the problem right\nWell that hasn't been challenged ah so that's the question do we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or no one shot to define that\nWell I I agree with you I Will leave without question you have\nSomebody on a ... look or you know when when you see that when if I was a judge and I say well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution and say well I'm going to pull up a call\nThe judge and I say well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution say well I'm going to flip a coin\nAnd and see where it lands that's going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first ... or the second amendment as many of the just as the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why did they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that\nYou know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that ... because it isn't ate it isn't a law that has written specifically there was no specific ... it it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\n\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what were you and I've talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] and uh they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in their ... it really does because\nThe argument would be made then in this case coming from the other side well\nIf if [laughter] if\nA Jacob powered the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended it to be a such\nThen the citizenship clause should have been written so\nExactly and since it wasn't the only thing you can do is go back and see what the authors mindset was who actually wrote the bill ... members of Congress I wrote that amendment that got passed what that ... there's nothing else you can really go on you have to go on that if your original list", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The
