usually that want to slight may happen next year I understood correctly [laughter] it's a delight to talk to you\nAgain well we had our picture made together and I was just like a child I was just so thrilled because I have so much\nA respectful you and um you know just thrilled to pieces that you've got this show and doing so well and your daughter is doing a\nAn incredibly wonderful job for the president and for the country\nWell thank you very much I'm very proud of her or I tell people that Donald Trump was not my first choice for president because I was my first choice for president [laughter] a buddy was my second choice and I also say the least we got a Huckabee and the White House just wasn't the one I thought what ended up being there\n[laughter] you know it's got to be tough or as a dad to watch people beat up on your little girl every day and let's face it doesn't matter how growing up she gets she's always going to be your little girl\nWell she is but you know it doesn't make me nervous as people think and I'll tell you why because I Know are well enough to know how tough years and when I see some guy like Jim Acosta smart often try to you know put the squeeze on her\nI'm more afraid for what's about to happen to him as I realized he's about to get his head handed to him I just know it yet and sure enough she turns and really Texan down a notch and I I watch or with guys like that and I'm thinking you know I've seen that same approach that she makes to her five year old and a three year old son\n[laughter] All right I Love semi is the fact that you have supported President Trump and ... everybody ... it would try to do that you know ... in our president\nThat's true as a fact a lot of people seem to ignore Richard your call Charlotte let's go to Calvin in St Louis hello Calvin\nHey how are you where well you know you're you're ...\nYou're talking to the governor of the world there I mean I I I I grew up in Arkansas and when he said about girls is absolutely true 'cause I have five girls\nAnd every one of them to take down just about anybody if they're fighting and stuff that they believe at it and you should just be so proud of your daughter I I agree with that lady earlier but I just wanted to ask you what I wanted to say something to\nYou know you're one of the most truthful people I have ever heard on the radio or TV or as a governor or as a politician\nOr concerning abortion I think you're about the only person I hear\nA hundred percent of the time talking the truth about what that's about it and I think cabinet or I Would ask you I mean do you think that that has more to do about abortion but it does anything else where Kavanaugh facing this opposition\nI think it does a talented and in large measure because the liberals are scared to death that there might be an honest look and or a revisit a row the weight which was a ridiculous decision\nThat was a reaching out into thin air and creating a law that did not have any basis in the constitution but what most people don't understand either to grow the weight or reversed\nDoesn't end abortion all it does is it gives it back to the states and each and every state would make its own decision how it would approach it my own view is that the best way for us to deal with the abortion question\nIs to deal with it true the issue of person heard because if we would accept the biological fact this is the science of of the unborn that\nEvery person is a person from the point of conception\nThen the Fifth Amendment would actually be far stronger than any Robie way a ruling ever could be in protecting life liberty and pursuit of happiness\nAnd would provide due process and would make it impossible for anyone to deprive a person of their life and liberty and I I really hope that that's where we end up moving with this because this should be about protecting innocent people not just about stopping abortion\nGoing back to ten seconds here am I then I went to the stay on the line we'll speak off air but I was doing a little trickier the calendar on inauguration day twenty twenty five you'll be sixty nine same ages Reagan was when he was

Republicans in name only and uh\nAnd so I think those two viewpoints may not be a good news for Republicans\nYeah I'm up all true I think all\nTrump has basically said that this is a referendum on hand at that as a national election not good for a Republican or any time the power and the party in power and so they're trying to keep the ... election er and not have\nA Trump is the main issue they want on may ... judicial appointments or do they want that to talk about because a trust approval rating still not great it's a and the\n... the low forties if you look at a solid holes in the

that that\nThey would be out in full force on something so important to the left\nRight but we're not seeing a number of them I just find that interesting\nOr the Senate Judiciary committee released an executive summary late last night of the FBI\nLast night and the FBI supplemental background report a into a Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh according to the summary released by the Republican committee majority\nFBI agents interviewed ten people in reached out to eleven focusing only on witnesses with potential first and knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct by cabinet and\nThe FBI provided to the Senate twelve detailed thrilled to reports summarizing their interviews with the witnesses\nAs well as supporting materials sudden by the witnesses during their interviews\nAmong those question where mark judge PJ Smith Leland Kaiser that three individuals Christine Ford claimed were president when Kavanaugh allegedly through or on the bed and sexually assaulted her some time in the Nineteen eighties\nUh all three of those individuals had already provided statements to the Judiciary Committee under penalty of ... of a felony denied any knowledge of the alleged assault Kaiser Ford's\nLifelong best friend or denied ever knowing Kavanaugh when questioned about Kaiser statement at last Thursday's hearing Ford suggested Kaiser was having serious medical issues and had apologized for her denial\nA judge was also questioned extensively about other allegations\nAre besides for the FBI also interviewed to individuals name in Kavanaugh's ... calendar entry which some observers said could have described the gathering where she was purportedly attack\nThose individuals where his longtime friend Christopher Garrett and Timothy God debt whose house Kavanaugh went to for beers according to his calendar an attorney for one of those witnesses was also interviewed finally the FBI interviewed ... mirrors the woman who claimed\nAnd an explosive New Yorker piece of Kavanaugh had exposed himself\nOr to her at Yale party the FBI also interviewed to alleged eye witnesses identified by mirrors and tried to interview a third but that individual refused to cooperate agents also interviewed one of ... close friends from college the supplemental background check investigation confirms\nWhat the Senate Judiciary committee concluded efforts investigation there is no cooperation of the allegations made by Dr Ford or Mrs Ramirez ...\nDistrict committee Republicans wrote\nVery ... and they went after people I remember a merry said why at forty different people for them to talk to her twenty would ever was right and the FBI said don't only people that you claim were their first hand knowledge or say doesn't count right so tell us you know tell us who is there who you claim was there ever will interviewed those people\nThat had first hand you claim have first hand knowledge we're going with your claims you tell us right and they did know cooperation right for either ...\nOr or for it so interesting to know that that's what that is what it has come out in the summary well what's interesting here\nIs that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday on the program and and we were we were wondering in this process because of the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details in those three oh two reports a secret\nAnd can be viewed only by a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall to tell us essentially gay or nay if there is something new there or something more to this investigation in other words something to substantiate the claims by Dr Ford and ...\nAnd that summary of you if you look at it by the the Judiciary Committee is basically I think in part works to the effect\nOf as you mentioned yesterday would they be trying to get some of this information out so the Democrats don't have the claim that this wasn't a thorough background check the facts of the matter is\nYou're not going to you're only going to interview people with first hand knowledge or people that were said to have had first hand knowledge anyone else isn't going to be included in that process the point being\nThe left the screaming all day long on Thursday which was predictable and we said it was going to happen this is something that you know that that uh this was a cover up that that's the words they were using its a cover up no it's not\nBecause Dr who's right now tell me\nWon this scenario because if it's true is hiding it from the Washington Post you say it's a cover up who's hiding evidence who's hiding evidence that they couldn't call the the New York times and the New York times would put it on the front page tomorrow\nTell me who is being covered up Dr ... lawyers\nDr Ford in her lawyers were holding up and it's right that they claim cooperate her story\nRight and it's not in the media already for video road log here's your forecast\nThe desert southwest back under dry conditions after what was hurricane Rosa has moved north where it will see stretches of by ten mainly clear today with the exception of far western Texas

civil liberties union national political director\nThey put out an ad where they had Kavanaugh side by side with Bill Cosby\nYeah it's a terrible slander reset and let's put it this way any it'd be a show you ran that ad against a private citizen they'd be sued for millions of dollars yeah uh there is no even\n[noise]\nThey're not even trying to hide anymore but they're not about civil liberties that they don't believe in the presumption of innocence but I just want to play a part of the interview that back and forth because it gets to the point of being in sane remember the American civil liberties union what are they what why were they created\nTo defend people's individual rights\nTo protect people that have been wrongly accused not just wrongly convicted wrongly accused the presumption of innocence is always the ... the number one thing that evidence is what determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to exist to protect\nPeople's civil liberties their their civil rights here's part of the back and forth\nThis is a disgusting at obviously but what's so distressing is that you ran it because this is guilt by association the very thing the ACLU milk belief stood against ring for instance the blacklist period they'll casualty and ... capital have nothing in common and get your twin them in order to discredit capping off\nHow could you do that has the effect of you\nTo appreciate your comments Tucker that the common thread here of course as powerful men whose careers are on the line issuing denial about sexual wrongdoing\nAnd and The Simpsons and simply believe that the denial issued by Brett Kavanaugh goes right to integrity [noise] a position that he's applying for on ... on the Supreme Court in which he sets in judgment of the rest of the nation integrity is on the critical importance the most important thing about a whole not that\nGreat I I agree and I I Would never arguing against the importance of integrity but Bill Cosby has been convicted of crimes in court and when he says there's a lot of that's the one that the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like new ones defended by capital has not been so toning them together\nIs by definition guilt by association and unfair do you think that the person your position Twenty years ago would have seen that\nTucker this isn't a civil or criminal trial I think you understand that we're talking about a job for ... probably now assessment so that when I'm making the standard of proof here it's not a brief beyond a reasonable doubt so then why do you put it next to Bill Cosby who has been tried in ... he is not entitled to the presumption of innocence if you assume that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job of them so\nI I'm not sure what am I hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asking you why you put him next to a man who was tried in court and convicted of felonies and sentenced to\nPrison because if they voted ... does things that individual also denied the accusations I think he would appreciate Tucker that we're criticizing people on the left and I don't care about the left in the right I care about the participants to make the country was when she wants to prevent it and now you you're an eight on set up and\nSexual assault has taken very seriously here Tucker and I think that we're often crowding out the voices of women and believing the men and not believing women in this case\nThis woman came forward and we're not sure how it was his own circumstances here hold on a sale on your the ACLU you've don't believe in collective judgment or collective punishment and we've lived long enough to remind you believe 'cause I think I Know more about your organization or any of that have been a lot of the nation\nAgainst an individualized determination about this woman has had or I honestly couldn't actually thinking that you're that can reasonable mode so why would you say it's about women being heard when of course that's not how they live out in one wasn't making one allegation against one man some instances\nThere haven't been other men who denied accusations that ... that we've said all we're saying is that in this instance like in ...\nThis instance like in previous says women deserve an opportunity but as her about hold on suing your endorsing\nCollective judgment and collaborative John Atlanta sheds are what are your other women have nothing to do with that sort of the NASA running as half an hour is on the merits of the issues against Kavanaugh has\nNot been honest and forthright Tucker I Believe that said hey come forward and said listen all of us were yelling at some point in life we sort of thing I Want to ask me what okay ... okay well let me ask you something that I've wanted to write this on\nThe ACLU is the reason that the first amendment was defined\nIn the ... versus Ohio case of Nineteen sixty seven he was a coins men and you guys defended his right to speak and that's why I have the right to say what I think is true they say it was now decided they're not gonna offend anybody they disagree with\nNo sir I think we have ... we are defending right now they were low for defining\nWere no ... is the ... name another group but out here we have all that with people on different ideological hiding from the other group to say more than they are trying to shut down because you know I'm trying to do my principal now\nLet me in the middle of the memo from ... in your group\nWe're not going to assessing cases that may advance the goals of white supremacists or other as soon as the themes are contrary to our values if you're not defending people who are unpopular disagree with why do you still exist we absolutely defend the people we are doing a song writer I look at the\n[laughter] you have a case in New York where we are defending their we look at ... yeah I mean [laughter]\nSo it was known to be done at that point in humans [laughter] right well because they they do draw the line and they are a political organization\nAnd let her just let it go where no longer ... and ... and he read remember when they they said they're going to change right that they're not going to defend people that don't share the same value right hope that that you've been you've blown it completely you were not going to defend their rights over there to free speech but again as we have subtle along\nOn this issue there had been so many\nOff shoot arguments that have nothing to do with how Tucker Carlson right there was trying to bring it down to no wait a minute\nWe judge this case in our system we judge this issue by the merits of this issue as we said earlier\nBecause somebody else has been sexually assaulted\nDoes not give them their opinion any more credibility on this particular issue the only thing that matters is the evidence to back up her allegation that's it ... it doesn't matter that other women had been\nA criminally sexually abused just like if somebody was making the allegation that they were robbed somebody else who was robbed does not have\nA greater morality or greater credibility to judge that particular issue which judged on the evidence that exists and that alone right that's what that's the only thing that you can go buy in the system and the ACLU is now saying to hell with that right\nBecause no other case counts no other criminal case counts no other victims opinions carry more credibility just because of their victims it is the evidence in\nEvery particular case that counts otherwise anyone can make the claim\nAnd if you're saying we believe the survivors and you'll be have like the ... the ACLU or any organization or protester right now that it's chanting the same thing\nThen wait for it because at some point one of you will be falsely\nAccused [noise] well you know when they say believe the survivor at that particular point mhm just alone believe the you know believe the survivor which means believe the person making the allegation right well actually believe the survivor actually means believe that people make believe the person making the allegation if they're if they are in favor\nOf the political issue the the the the actual\nA background political issue that we're really dealing here as long as\nIt's someone on our side that's making the accusation yes we all know that's what we all know what it really means but to say believe the survivor means you believe the person making the allegation irrespective of any other evidence that exists right\nBecause you can't say believe the survivor and ended up that no you can't you can't that's on American to say that that's an American that's not believing in the constitution it's not believing in individual rights\nIt's everything that the ACLU used to stand for\nStand for that now they reject completely and Tucker Carlson later on said he lost his temper temperature when he called them hacks well you didn't they are hatched they are they're trying to be on their hands because they're trying to portray themselves as people that care about civil liberties when obviously they don't\nIt's all about politics to them look\nAt you and I have our ... our day to day politics that that we promote on the air but we also promote individual rights irrespective of our opinion on the issues of the day of individual rights and the constitution is still number one to watch yes it's not so the ACLU eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nThe weight back with more readily radio with a recording diary McNamara [noise]", "show_name":
