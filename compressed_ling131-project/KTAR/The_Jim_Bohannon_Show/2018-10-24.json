I'm right now there for one am for three B. and the ... facility\nOkay um well the four oh one K. is after tax correct\nSo that doesn't have any penalty to convert it to a rough I always suggest as a general rule when you leave your employer\nTake everything that's vested enroll it into an IRA and good growth stock mutual funds you're more accessibility more control and more options to pick from and the open market\nThan you do leaving something behind in trying to manage it through a former employer right some examples that I Would not converted to a Roth if it's pre tax\nUnless you're out of debt have your emergency fund and have some extra money to pay the taxes that creates but the four oh one hey you can go ahead and stick that into a rough it doesn't cost you a dime\nBecause there's already after tax money that's in there um you know it could be some growth in there that how you don't pay taxes on possibly um but it probably wouldn't be much so just you know ... are you out of debt\nI'm I Will be I have about ten thousand dollars left on the phone but um by the time I make the transition of that covered\nOkay well then the other question is would you're not going to have your emergency phone number ... so we're not we don't do anything that creates any taxes so when you sit down with your smart Mr pro roll it all over to Iowa raise\nA traditional IRAs unless you can move some of it to a rough IRA in similar mutual funds um without any taxes and then later on if you want to convert it to Ross from traditional the taxes that are created you just need to be able to pay those in cash\n\nElbows a triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five stricter policy meal for the earth day Ramsey what's the best way to decide which payment plan I should go with from my student loans a minimum\nPayments on every thing except your smaller Sloan and throw every dollar you can possibly throw at it when it's gone attack the next one down when it's gone attacked the next one down that's called the debt snowball and that is the most efficient way and the most the highest probability way to get a student loan debt\nVery fast and very hard do not get into income based repayment plans do not get into I'm going to pay the minimum I can pay ... pay the freaking maximum you can pay as Sallie Mae if they did get that old ugly woman out of your house\nShe is not a good roommate you want her to leave Louis is on\nFacebook should pull a thousand dollars out of my four oh one K. to do baby step one\nOh you don't cash out of four O. one K. except to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure when you take money out of your four O. one K. they charge you a ten percent penalty plus your tax right\nNow that means if you make Seventy five thousand dollars a year household income your tax rates twenty five percent plus ten percent that means you just got charged thirty five percent interest\nIn fact\nI mean it's not technically interest it's penalties and taxes but you never borrow money thirty five percent interest ... baby step one no\nNo no no no no\nOr would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no\nWell the only held and tortured percentile that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much the government keeps you in the teeth\nThe government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus your tax rate you do not gay shout retirement accounts unless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure of its save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt it's the only way you keep from found bankruptcy yeah you would do that\nBut at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know but definitely not\nCatch it out to buy a car or\nBeyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know\nBut

Hi Dave I'm doing well thank you for taking my question sure I'm so into that than six my husband and I purchased a first home and to death and an eight the market crashes slash\nThe value of our house now three years ago our family grew and we bought a new home twenty percent down it's been twelve years now and I'll first home it's still not war for worry about it for and we\nWait a minute wait a minute that that's not economic there's something else going on I ... a few places in the United states of not recovered after twelve years would you buy a ... or what\nI I don't understand it either 'cause we live in northern Virginia which is like very close to Washington DC and right now it's worth two hundred and Ninety five K they bought it at um\nAccording to my realtor and we bought the house at three hundred and fifty K.\nA recent comparative market analysis by quality real estate agent says this house is worth three hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me\nYes\nSo you must have done the world's worst real estate deal\nI I that will likely satellite I we bought the house into that and I said you know what I own it up and I'm a I'm Sorry that you owe on it um right now we all about sixty chaotic\nOh Charlotte you think well we can sell it it's crap the world's worst house\nThought we needed to do it so much [laughter] so you think we should wait for it we we just talk for ten years\n[noise] All right do you that that could mean actually my question because right now we're at ... baby step number six\nHere's the thing we gave you three hundred thousand dollars in cash would you go by the house next door\nKnow why because this sucks\nThis neighborhood is not appreciating for some reason or another it's the world's worst rate of return meanwhile the rest of the nation dripped way down and his up twenty percent\nI I I agree with you I had this is why I'm calling in because I'm trying to decide if we should continue to write this out no and wait until okay\nNo it's a bad investment it's a bad neighborhood I don't know what's wrong here but I mean a ... a house you paid three and fifty thousand dollars for in two thousand freaking six before the crash it goes down and it's not even recovered back to three fifty\nIt mean that's a very unusual real estate market unusually bad and I don't want to invest in it and going forward and so I wouldn't keep it going forward take your take your loss and get out you bought in a really bad place for some reason I don't know what's wrong but that's the worst numbers I've heard and I don't know when\nI mean everywhere else just about as recover Florida went down the Knicks went down freaking Las Vegas crashed and has recovered\nYou know I mean but there's some you know there's some parts of Detroit that habit but those are economic pockets but it's not an overall national economy thing and so you don't buy in bad economic\nPockets yeah and you don't keep in bad economic pockets and so out of there I'm Out of there from you amount of they're done quickly done yes thanks\nFor the call appreciate your joining a suction alright Heather's with us in Raleigh North Carolina Hi Heather how are you I'm going to have you are to better and then I deserve votes up in your world\n... add a question on how long it take me to pay off my dad\nAnd I want you to do you have not counting your house thirty five thousand what your household income\nI make my full time job and make thirty five [noise] um when my part time work I can make anywhere between forty five fifty\nWe were doing better to part time and your your fold them\nIn a combat oh okay okay God already quoted fulltime either okay\nSo fifty is your top in your own thirty five on what\nUm it's a car and I my home equity line which I combined my student loans and my pre existing on liquid Eli\nOkay and how much do you own your stupid car a twenty thousand sell it and you're going to say that yeah\nYou don't make thirty five thousand dollars a year driving twenty thousand dollar car that didn't work\nYou've got too much tied up and things going\nYeah\nYou don't make thirty five thousand dollars a year driving toward that was our car that didn't work\nYou're got too much caught up and things going down in value and you've got a four hundred and fifty dollar car payment don't you\nKnow it's almost like I've done this before yeah yeah that's killing yeah\nIt is not a blessing is it kind of the car it's not a blessing\nIt's financially killing you\n... owns you you work for this car\nYour part time job that you took is because of this car\nShort worth it sell the car\nAnd then work your way through the debt and then you'll be debt free in about a year year and a half ... and then in you know including the car that you buy that is very very cheap that years like five thousand dollar car that you pay cash for or you pay it off very very quickly with your other debts but\nI mean you love this car if you want but I don't love the score it's a stupid car and it's killing you your numbers are horrendous on this um\nIf you have more than half of your income tied up in cars or things with motors on them all total up then you have too much of your life tied up and things that are going down in value and you're always going to struggle\nIt's causing you to be middle class or lower middle class socio economically speaking financially speaking and it's all because of a choice of what you're choosing to drive\nI Would not choose to drop that I Would rather be wealthy ... whatever I Want later Dr

a slave to the lender is right that's a pretty impressive stuff gosh wow very cool so what do you tell people to key to getting out of debt is\nA that's a that's a great question um one thing I can say is you you have to be committed a once you agree to do something you have to be committed to do it and and you have to see beyond your current situation you have to see what you want to be more than you see where you are ...\nThat once you can see beyond that then you can start to dream a\nAnd and there's many times where we actually drove through neighborhoods and looked at the nice houses and say you know when we do is right we can go pick a house and we can do that ... ... well he wants to do it right\nYou know I hadn't thought about that sharing and I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and this and go you know someday we could do that and here's all we gotta we gotta do this this and this and then we can get there\nAnd it wasn't like oh we'll never get their roll our eyes open or those bigger people rich people is more like I'm going to be wanting you mhm and you know and that's what you do when you drop it and read them all live here that's all

magnets self governance thing and sometimes that rebounds to impact the rest of the world\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo we're talking a jet Babin former deputy undersecretary of defense and currently columnist with the American spectator on lighted spectator dot org we're talking about the end of this intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which President Reagan had concluded that thirty one years ago with Mikhail Gorbachev\nAnd let's see what we have denied on the mind of Glenn who calls in from Cedar Rapids Iowa the boy had a job Glenn the good evening\nThey chew first satellite to uh\nAgree with President Trump's withdrawal from the tree and they're also general comments about job bowl but I think he's a national security stood my comment is is I was in the military all to the seventies and eighties purging to live so cruel\nAnd Germany what they would say that the European Union is going to allow the areas that are immediate ... weapons that we may or may not produce there'll be put on their soil they scream bloody murder about this with any of these\nWell I don't know I mean I assume the NATO countries that have a certain obligations Jed but you would know better than I\nWell I mean they certainly do but I you know he's ready to get very very good point I don't think that the NATO countries are going to allow\nUh interesting medium range ground launch cruise missiles or any other kind of nuclear capable missiles on their territory oh so that's one of the reasons that I'm saying in my article that we probably don't need necessarily\nTo develop a tit for tat ah there are a lot of things that are driving us to do so I mean certainly the defense against the Chinese intermediate\nRange of weapons could include a an intermediate range weapon of our own but I'm not advocating necessarily that we have to develop and field and I ended up and violating cruise missile ourselves are a lot of other ways to do this my preference frankly is for us to bolster our missile defense systems\nWe have some very good missile defense system but they're not perfect by any means uh they're probably not going to stop more than twenty five or thirty percent of any missile attack and that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think\nIs all set with the Russians are doing here but a lot more money at all\nBull attack and that certainly is not good enough for we want to do I think is all set with the Russians are doing here put a lot more money and a lot more time and to perfecting are missile defenses\nThat deserves a follow up of course the whole notion of missile defense so derided as a star wars by Senator Ted Kennedy and others in point of fact there is nothing\nAbout the notion of a missile defense that is in the least impossible you were talking about the speed of missiles and the speed of computers\nAnd uh the the the course of the speed of computers is increasing every second it seems like and it was only a matter of time before we will be able to as the old expression with shoot down a bullet with another bullet that\nThis is not something that has any inherent impossibility difficulty yes\nWell and you're right but we've already done it I mean the question is how to get it better I mean we have systems right now our strategic missile defense system station and California and Alaska\nAre capable of intercepting a ballistic missile in flight a we have the bad a terminal high altitude air defense system or we have batteries are and I think South Korea I Know we have in other nations to I don't know if they're in Britain or not but yeah we have a lot of other places\nAh you know these systems work they're not a hundred percent sure what I'm saying is let's put the money and and and invest in the science and engineering and get a systems to the point where they're going to be a lot closer to a hundred percent effective\nDo a call from Zach in the western Nebraska good evening Zach\nThis gentleman I'm calling in about the uh the boat and then today with ... and um and a ... a little clip a quote of putting the saying um about the American\nEagle eating all of the olives and all they have left as the arrows\nAnd uh I Wanna back up and and just tell everybody I did vote for Donald Trump\nUm and the reason I did that was because of the non intervention all uh aspect that he was portraying during the campaign or and I heard that term Neal con being thrown around\n[noise] and ah and I think that's exactly what's happening here and I I don't understand why we the American or continue to lead a banker or dictate our politics\nI don't know that we are allowing any quote banker wars to dictate any politics nor do I see anything in tonight's discussion Jeb that wouldn't be in reality a pulling back from war anytime you allow someone to aggregated treaty in this way you're almost inviting trouble aren't you\nWell I ... I mean even the Romans had his phrase sports used from rebel of if you want to prepare for war\nAnd that's really what we're doing here we're not allowing someone to violate a tree and get away with it and whether or not we upped the ante as you know a very different question and how we do it is a much better questions so I don't know Jack me by\nBanker sponsored wars of ... that sounds a little frankly paranoid may\nWell ... is not I think of what we're talking about here tonight and in fact what we are talking about tonight is not any kind of a of intervention in third party affairs this is a treaty between the U.S and Russia or the successor state to the Soviet Union and up\nIt's every bit our business and to this particular uh item of business was probably long overdue one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six\nAs we talked a jet Batman contributing editor to the American spectator deputy undersecretary of defense in the Bush forty one administration he writes the loose canons column\nFor T.

you know with\nAbout the uh the the excitable turn out that you know ... you know that that's what they talking about the excited voter out there on both sides right who the motivated excited voter who wants to go out and vote now doesn't mean it's a positive excite but it can be\nAn angry excitement and if so if you look at the big picture out there or the Democrats that hate Trump now could they hate him any more\nThan they did the\nUh the day before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is he is the\nAnger ... still there to motivate\nThe Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know when you when I talked about this this president is up I every president is unique and every Republican president we forget because people will say nobody has ever been attacked like Donald Trump\nBefore we forget that Bush was called not see the only thing is a difference between a Bush and they Donald Trump is or should never fought back\nSo if you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase mhm but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad if you're from ... rubber the protests started his ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas ... it was everything they were hanging I'm an effigy they read everything he was ... he was\nA ... and as Bill Maher said well yeah\nUh we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we called them Hitler but they\nReally weren't but trumpet some and they just move on and then there will be the next ...\nOh we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we call them Hitler but\nReally weren't but Trump is ... and they just move on and then there will be the next Republican president that gets in and whether they decide to fight back whenever that is either that\nOr what if what if a Republican actually named Hitler runs one day what why [laughter]\n\nI I'm trying to think if there is is there a politician in American aimed at\nPlayer I'm I'm guessing if that's your name you you might want to change it and most have\nAnd and the thing is as I mentioned earlier the danger of Trump exhaustion was blown out of the water because of capital\nRight right\nAnd is it is as it is it's ... fire right on that I like how energize yeah is there are the Republicans yeah because I have never in in that time period that that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent we'll find out in two weeks\nBut I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw I'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so\nUnited and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much a back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine\nSo uh you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time\nI Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United when they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people over Kavanaugh that to me that to me still\nIs the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the polls if it is what I think it is or what I suspect it could be if it actually is that\nI think the Republicans could hold the house if it's not they are on hold the ... right right yeah\nUm and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the mid west and and what's going on with the you know terrorists if if that's affecting enough voters in the mid west or to to turn some of those districts ah or to just

[noise]\nI'm trying to get older then I'm gonna I'm gonna do so in the middle and all that often you if\nYou don't get anywhere right back them into a corner forget ... honestly forget about Jorge Ramos ... nobody cares about him go to Nancy Pelosi go to Chuck Schumer challenged the Democrats mhm make this an issue the last two weeks what do you want\nWhat's your what we're trying what if you if if the house gets control and you're able to say uh what kind of a of a funding will go to border control um what would you support give us the type of border control do support right\nWhat's the border control that you support and be specific and if they just say we're for comprehensive now that's not an answer challenge them getting their fate what this comprehensive mean do you get get get it get it and I mean get in their face rhetorically\n... the first thing what is the first thing the number one thing that comprehensive plant right what does that look like the American people by and large want border control\nDo you want to control or a ... Ramos does not one word of mouth but he's not a part of the government so it don't it don't even bother with him I don't care what a reporter thing right ... forget about him he works for Univision go right to the Democrats ...\nAnd say the Democrats keep talking about this or what would you do what you keep talking about comprehensive immigration reform\nThe thing that this has been going on for the last ... you know really since two thousand eight remember the protest that that that happened and still ten years have gone by and still the Republicans have not challenged the Democrats\nTo back him into a corner to tell America what they actually want we know what they want do because all of the activists\nJorge Ramos who was attempting to influence and is a major influence in the Democratic party he wants to open borders ship so they want to open borders let the American make them be forced them into a corner\nWhere they even have to admit it or you've taken every argument away with the American public can clearly see that they want open borders\nSince it's brought up again and the caravan is coming towards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion stop talking about everything else mhm stop talking about\nTowards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion stop talking about everything else mhm stopped talking about things that don't matter you can bring this back right after Kevin ought to be the number one issue again\nFind out where the Democrats stand on an issue Mr President where the ... where the country stands behind you in a huge majority yeah use it to your advantage\nYep because\nAt the end of it what you're going to see is that we need to have an open borders or this is what they want this is what they would promote if they were talking honestly if they were going to be Robert rice speaking to Berkeley and I'm not on healthcare but on border control they would say no people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it and this was the other thing I Would\nI Would start doing that on debate stage I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say that every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please\nSay that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you because then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left\nYeah yeah and and this device I'd give the president as Mr President people already know what you think ... forget about what have you with you ... everybody's asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around yes what America needs to know is not what you think on a legal immigration or American thing sign a legal immigration you need to get an answer out of Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue or ... I mean what are we lose the house and joins ... it's still going to be an issue\nTake it to the Democrats and they have forced you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times\nAnd the press is that you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm\nA Kennedy McCain yeah yeah since really ... when was that was that two thousand eight two thousand no no no it was before ... it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board knows while we're doing the show became Kennedy was\nYeah we were in Arlington studios\nOkay yeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling scam misty um yes it was because it was two thousand eight\nIt was two thousand dollars was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay is one of our first well and and then then it would have been the following\nYear or maybe later that year when it after it went away\nThat McCain had to go to the um uh the uh he was at the conservative a convention than and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\nYeah\nUh and it fell short or a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's why I say because I ... I was out here I was so low\nI remember going you know weeks on that and uh and I was so low and I was and so the the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now if you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh\nUh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it not from conservatives so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter]\nAnd then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote it but but it's\nBeen over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue ... huge issue because that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders that's what they want\nThat's to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders that's what they want and if they don't want it then tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you pass as a piece of legislation\nAnd promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question\nAnd if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner\nTo make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again because we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform or border enforcement or do they want to open borders\nWe can't come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nOne eight six six\nPhone regarding [noise]\nRight now AT T A N Petro stuffing centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme seat cushions is on sale burly sixty four Ninety seven\nYou been forced to make some tough choices over the past few years do you want greater fuel efficiency in profitability or a tough truck you can count on", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "24"}
