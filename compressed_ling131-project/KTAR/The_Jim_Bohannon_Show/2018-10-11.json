off\nYour\nShoes on Dave Ramsey your host of this is your show over the phone number\nHere's AAA to five five to too\nMany years ago I discovered that there are thirty one proper ...\nWhen you read the book of wisdom in the Bible written by Solomon there's thirty one of them which makes it fairly easy to read one a day so if you don't do anything else in your spiritual walk or in your search for wisdom you can read one proverb a day\nAnd if you do that over and over and over twelve times you would have read that book in one year right and I'm Thirty years later I have read it a bunch of times and I you know ... book wisdom and I you know what if you actually understand the stuff you will get wiser\nIsn't that interesting you know and here's what happens when you get wiser you life gets better\n'cause you don't stupid stuff you know I figured out the less stupid stuff I have a better life for her\nKnow it's fairly simple isn't it you kind of get back what you put out your report\nYou show if you plant corn corn grows every point it's stupid you grow broken desperate you know you're gonna get a crop up something in your life what your crop gonna look like right\nFor instance proverbs ... says slack hand causes poverty but the hands of the bill ... makes rich translation lazy\nWill make you poor and you work and you'll have money\nSo hard translation is it a slack hand calls us poverty but the hand of the diligent makes\nRich interesting\nDiligent was diligence diligence is excellence\nOvertime\nContinued excellence my one moment of excellence but continued ex launch an ordinary things when you're doing ordinary things with the level of excellence that's called diligence and by the way that makes one rich\nInteresting isn't it\nThe hand of the ... what's the hand hand of the Belgium much one rich\nSo here's where things are figured out I read this study years ago and now of observed it in all the millionaires we make way up and talk with and and it showed up again\nAnd and it showed up again in this millionaire study the Chris Hogan and the team just did for the everyday millionaire project you know we interviewed ten thousand millionaires and one of the things we found there and one of the things we found in this study before that that I read years ago was people who have wealth and keep wealth and build them well\nTo you and your meals for American dollars in San Francisco hard on them for him to show\nHim how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo I'm forty five and I'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a pension and I'll be\nGetting like Seventy five percent of my pay\nCheck in four one K. and stuff like that but um [noise] I've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid off some of my dad but um what's left is only about thirty four hundred\nBut I'm sure I'll be able to pay off in Ninety Days through um [noise] but my question is I've been looking into refinancing my house because I have an F ha and so I have PM I and I when I Do the math\nLike the six thousand dollars and closing cost versus the hundred and eighty seven\nMonth ends up being three years plus my interest rate is\nGoing to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do because\nYou're staying home longer than three years is the only way you can wind up getting gravy on that biscuit right yeah for sure so um that's how you analyze it um that's\nThat's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis are probably would not but if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point you are making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a well I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah oh but where your interest rates go up and offset that\nHe well he acts like a three point seven five now and everything I'm getting a quoted about like for you know so you're not going to make any money so is it better just saying I hate to\nSound like you're gonna be able to watch them you're probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six\nThousand okay and so one in three years I've already paid off ten thousand\nBut one percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year\nOkay and you're only saving Eighteen hundred or a hundred and eighty dollars a month which is about two thousand dollars a year so no I wouldn't do this ... if that's the numbers yeah I'm OK bicycle breaking even to refinance and I wouldn't do that I play the loan off\n[noise] and then I have one other question I guess joined ... and in my area everybody's already in session but some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still don't even go in\nYeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first questions on savings and you're already head of the game on that you're eating machine and and go back and watch it on with your own line because you got a one year membership and you can watch or listen to everything on line for a year\nOkay so yeah you go and watch the blessing one and then when you go in and you're right with whoever zone listen to your right in sync okay yeah no troubles are at all you're doing great what dawn you killed ... ... with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave I'm so we have a a a a great situation for our family but I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity\nUm and had spent to Boise how much but wait\nI'm Sorry what was that how much equity about two hundred and forty thousand boom boom love it\nYeah I'm Still we're here just renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or by 'em but I'm not quite sure because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we\nAll that a lot of debt that we can go yeah we don't have any debt good um but do we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah what we want or do we\nWhat we wanted we want where we you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have all that will put a small mortgage on it paid off real flesh\nOkay the only the only game I mean well I mean what's your household income or about a hundred and fifty okay and what what would you be taught\nWhat what would you be talking about building or buying or pressuring\nA preference between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty and the bank okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah but two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right now right I bet you don't pay that off five years\nTrailer babbling yet you know I mean just knock it out how old are you that I'm I'm forty five and my husband it if\nYou have any money in savings or investments to this not in a retirement account\nAnd it all OK All right\nWell my role is almost never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach that\nRight away and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred two hundred and develop more and\nMore did you don't really find house in Boise idaho for a half million dollars that's a long ... wonderful property and read about what\nWe're hoping more real property that now they have\nIt's a whole different world though obviously from where you came from rights and so um I mean you're bang for buck is huge and boy she compared to\nYou know a big City California so um yeah you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words\nI'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later and that's how we would do it because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever\nBut if it's found only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case though just have the different mindset that the mortgage is just more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast I mean like other people's rated Carlo like five years or something you know let's just put on there and\nHow fast can we knock this thing in the head and let us get after it and that's how I Want to think about it some really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worrying about eight to ... ... pay off my about forty thousand dollars a day and start my emergency fund like card paid off\nWhat is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen does ... you have too much tied up I don't think it's going down in value when you're out on your car or things with motors or wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollar paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our how can they included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and you and then we\nGot a divorce and we sold the house and the car we paid off\nGot it okay and I got a card and so what is your um what is your income prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around thirty thirty tail so you don't see that you'll see this doubling then no okay why I haven't got school yet okay and I'm a single mother and fiber and\nSo yeah you you need the money more than you need that car don't you\nYeah I in the cars going down their value quick show yeah Charlotte pay off your debt put your emergency unemployed you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range okay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you can get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and then put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything what wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt's going down in value and when you have all that stuff out of the gather you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way\nAnd you get when you have more than half your annual income tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper in your case you're going to change your income by going to school and so he's going to change later\nBut for right now I'm with you yeah I Would sell that cost\nDishes today Ramsey show [noise]\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup and just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor and risk because there is risk when you have mortgage now it's not a lot of risk 'cause you got the money in the bank today to pay it off but or an investment to pay it off but there is risk\nAnd so ah you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of the foreclosures occur on home with a mortgage there is rich\nAnd so I'm getting rid of that\nHave found is it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula because when you don't have a mortgage or something making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money\nYour relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I have figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I have in cash that comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so all of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today\nAnd if you ... if this discussion bit sour on you and you think they rammed she's crazy a year from now just get you another mortgage\nNo I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that space just if it's a lot of money I Do you know I just go and get paid off but my mind sort of back and forth\nAnd I what I'm trying to point out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula got it that's what I'm pointing out is that makes sense completely yeah paid off do you got this\nThanks for the call open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five see your heart's where he's not really you guys your heart your heart's where you measure risk march telling me pay off my house\nMy hands telling me I could make more money on these ... Mooney with your heads missing some stuff it's missing risk\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing to I was doing this for the class of MBAs speaking to them and a cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I got a finance degree a stop to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teach us to borrow money and so um you know ... it's broke finance professor is like a shop teacher would missing fingers right people so think about this or I was like a ... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things so\nUm but there's you can really do a very\nSophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really in the radio to walk through the whole thing but what happens is is think about this\nHow many of you if you had zero debt and you looked over in your four O. one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for your emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many of you just said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I worked for and I would go do dot dot dot\nI'm not saying you go in business for yourself necessarily you might just have a different career you might go in a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting you know and here's the weird thing is\nThat saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're a wise about how you do it\nIdea that if you're going to live your passion you make half the money you make twice the money\nYou make more money when you're doing something you're good at because you work harder at it your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself from moving because you love it\nYou don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article I Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down here in doing this radio show when I'm In town I ...\nAnd I'm really good at it as a consequence in ... once I get paid a lot a lot of money on a shame middling I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this I'm here baby that's how I Want that for you see that's what set\nYou up to be how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your ball she was a jerk to stick it take this job and shut it I mean we would do that\nI mean we would do that yeah there you go that's it man and I'm not telling you\nQuit your job that I I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond the simple mathematics of the fact you don't have to be interesting will\nYou start to be set free slavery is more than a simple\nThe change of the show\nIt changes your relationship [noise]\nSlave bar or issues related\nI Love that call like your shirt that's because\nThis is the rams are shot [noise]\n... and here\nYou ever talk to people who say things like becoming a millionaire it's impossible to these big or people are only millionaires because they come from already wealthy families will we just got done with the largest research ever conducted on American millionaires and the simple truth is everyday people become millionaires all the time\nHow did they do it the overwhelming majority did so by investing consistently and with the help and guidance upper professional\nThat's where our team has already done the hard work for you we've vetted and interviewed thousands of investing professionals all across the country who are committed to helping you reach your goals just started today go to Dave Ramsey dot com slash smart dresser and look up the smart goes through prose and your area\n...

like a base in the water are being pushed up on people and or if you're still there when that comes and you're gonna die\nOfficials hammering home the message the storm surge alone can kill you but it is now\nHow to link to evacuate the worst thing you can do now is leave for yourself and your family in danger\n[laughter]\n[noise] and with that as a prologue let's talk a bit more about the storm and of course the tonight we also know the White House says that the president has spoken with the Governor Scott\nWho told the president not to visit the state until next weekend or not to interfere therefore with rescue effort is always a problem of course whenever high profile Andrew individuals or if you're a given area like that and ah and frequently they can cause a distraction\nGoing so well\nThat ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... [noise]\nWill stay as safe as dry as you can touch and thank you for taking time out\nAnd I\nThank you very much that's the ... in Panama City Florida where the brunt of this storm struck into we return now to our discussion with Dr Brian tag and assistant professor of the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the university at Albany State University of New York\nAnd I was noticing a doctor ten or comments made by a Natasha regarding the relative a quick pace of Michael in Florence of course as we recall was guilty of loitering\nOut why is it the storms of vary in terms of the pace at which they move\nWhile you can you can think of hurricane sort of like a leaf and stream and that is a you know the the leaf is is moving in a very slow meandering stream that that's sort of a certain it or not moving very quickly with like for instance I Will sort of linger over the place and that given period of time whereas\nA leaf in a fast moving stream like um like Michael will move very very quickly through an area\nWould it be safe to assume that a a faster moving storm is more likely to bring with the wind damage as opposed to the water damage in comparison with the Lawrence where the wind might be less but the water damage more or or can you even make that generalization\nIt's certainly if a storm is moving slower it will it will produce um\nA window over a a area for a longer period of time and it has capability in fact likelihood of producing flooding rainfall um but in terms of the when you can you can have a storms that are very intense much like Michael that are moving both slow and fast\nI say so in other words the the speed at which the storm moves across the surface of the ground that is to say it's it's land speed Iran not necessarily related to the uh the speed of its wins\nNo no it isn't\nA very good one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six as we watch\nMichael the remnants they're up continue to move across a Georgia having of course if the Florida Panhandle portions of Alabama as well\nAnd uh is still heading across the state of Georgia with our guest Dr Bryan tang of this\nDepartment which you teach atmospheric and environmental sciences\nOr that the people today I think uh they look at all these terms like a ... satellite pictures and we hear things like Doppler radar most of which of course most of his ... and early know what that is but\nIt sounds like you folks were are totally on touch a with the with what happens in the storm in other words I think we we may at one time we use to make jokes about the weatherman and how little they knew and compared with today I guess they had no honey watch today\nWe act like you guys know everything and if you're even off by a little bit I think we get on your case for that and did it strikes me that there's a happy balance there that\nThat you know more ... than you used to but it's not like you have a complete handle on every single storm but every single moment\nRight it it's it's the nature of the beef that weather prediction will always be uncertain to ... to some degree but in in the last decade or two we we've really come up very very long way and ability to predict whether integrate extreme storms like Michael\nYou I understand you have a research that you undergo at Albany a that focuses on tropical cyclone formation intensification and interactions with the the climate system let's start with formation\nWhat is it that is the existing out in the open ocean that causes a tropical depression to form\nWell and and the Atlantic ah we oftentimes see these clusters of thunderstorms that form or in the middle of Africa\nAnd they will move off the coast of Africa and about um ten percent of them so really tiny fraction and then well form into tropical depressions usually in August September and October\nWhy that time of year I Know there is a season but they're going to be a wide\nYeah and that's when the water\n... are at a warm is in the tropical Atlantic um that's also when the uh the atmosphere is is uh uh the the the more most moist\nUm and that is also when kind of the the jet stream which can interrupt the storms that um that that sort of brings storm winter storms that through our neck that was over the winter that's when it's the furthest north\nSo um it's just kind of the best environment that time of year for storms to form for hurricanes to far\nI guess it was maybe ten twelve years ago I was talking with somebody who ah worked with a of well at the time was considered I guess the greatest number crunching computer in the world and we were trying to lay people to get some understanding of what this thing could do and I asked him and says or anything\nThat this computer can't do any numbers they can't crunchy said yeah we can't get a handle on the on all the factors in the environment if you count all of the wind velocity and temperature and high pressure low pressure areas\nIs that you can put there are so many numbers there that that that computer at least the like I said about a decade ago that it couldn't handle that can handle other stuff that would boggle your mind but that it couldn't handle do we have computers today which can quote handle the the the amount of data that's out there\nUh yes it's it's it's always a challenge because there's just so much data a on any given day or our satellites and in space or take many many measurements are over to the entire globe and that all needs to be um put into these uh weather prediction models\nIn order to forecast them out on that as a as a pretty a daunting task to do but as our computers get a a more powerful and um we we sort of learned about the Amish are more and more um we've definitely made great strides in weather production as a result\nSo we looked a bit at the tropical psych load formation of this by the way folks will be three credit hours at the end of the uh [laughter] but now that then the other part of your research intensification okay so the little tropical depression\nWhy do these things and I guess not in every case do they but but why do they in some cases become these intense storms\nRight and and Tennessee changes is one of the grand challenges of tropical aside from production that something that we we still struggle with um as we clearly song Michael we we did not anticipate you know a few days ago that it would be making landfall as such a strong\nA tropical site found or hurricane um so what sort of we we generally understand kind of what feel with ... that is as you as you said for kind of warm ocean waters that are live below the ... are both below to hurricane\nAnd that provides a kind of the fuel gasoline for the power to Windsor to store\nAll right and then that takes us to interactions with the lead the climate system itself uh are there uh are there are portions of the planet\nWhich are let us say predisposed to uh to the formation of a depression due to a storm to to hurricanes ah portions of the planet where a a all else being equal a it's a friendly environment for this kind of storm information\nIf they're the the Atlantic actually is is not the most active in terms of the number of hurricanes that formed the um Pacific particularly the western part of the Pacific I'm off the coast of 'em in China and Japan and the Philippines\nUm get many many more hurricanes are out there they're called typhoons by the same system there there's just different names for for them um and they regularly get storms as intense as Michael I'm a you know a a great number of them every year\nAnd that there's another thing that I think confuses the lot of us okay hurricanes in the Atlantic and I guess what the Eastern Pacific typhoons in the in the western Pacific is that right\nYes tight and it's in the western Pacific and fights loans yeah the store generic cycling as the Indian Ocean and in the southern hemisphere\nInteresting and those are just terms of convenience we are centrally talking about the same phenomena right\nYes the way which is why in the science community we just referred to everything as a ... phone instead of a hurricane because that's just kind of a generic name\nUrban up All right we will continue our discussion tonight and your calls welcome of course uh either as a question for our guest\nA since everybody talks about the weather uh and I'm also in the experiences you may have in particular if you are facing the wrath of Michael we'd be interested in hearing from you as well at one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six\nFive oh five four six to six our guest is Dr Bryan tagging assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences\nAmid all science was at the University of Albany State University of New York back with more in just a moment\nArizona news news station Katie a our news\nOn Ninety two three

R. dot com and streaming live on that Katie a our news pay its Mac watching for my friends are renters warehouse it used to be when you move you call it a real estate agent well today you call a property manager why because renting is the new selling and writers warehouses made renting so easy and affordable\nIt's crazy to do it any other way you see ranchers warehouse they perfectly price you're home they find great tendency in on average just Seventeen days and for only eighty nine dollars a month they're professional landlords manager property twenty four seven which means they collect the rent they handle the maintenance request\nYou have a call from Donna in Huntsville, Alabama the jumbo how to do with our guest Dr Brian ... of the University of Albany State University of New York good evening da da\nDi da ... New Jersey and I was like a restaurant here I feel kind of like a hurricane snob and there's not much reference to hurricane Camille August ... nine right side yes and nothing after\nI had never been worse uh I think a lot of these other storm hit been getting a wrong in the city as a comparison to Camille I mean that even had a hundred and twenty five foot wall of water come up from the Gulf or there were\nTankers ever African freighters bar just on a highway Ninety and up into the residents that area\nAnd they didn't have the type of coverage that we have now I mean we couldn't get on a computer or you know Facebook or health journey thanks how I was wondering if\nYou can comment on the fact that um that's given no reference as far as the ... of it and I really don't think any of these others come anywhere near it\nYou're exactly right Camille is kind of in a class in its own and and a lot a lot of people these days don't remember a restaurant because I did occur such a long time ago and you're you're right that the pictures of\nOf the the devastation along the coast uh\nWere was absolutely tremendous um what's what's different today perhaps is that oh the one thing that has changed is that there's just so many more people\nAnd I'm buildings along the coast so uh when we do have any sort of major hurricane I'm heading inland it's just affecting generally a lot more people a lot more buildings a lot bigger portion of our economy\nI'm just I'm because of like being on the coast of the very desirable thing people love to you know with a look at the ocean every day um and so that's their choice to do that you know\nYeah and there was a tremendous amount of that conversation I went through the entire thing ha ha I went to all of it so I mean I'm\nA ... got a crash course and I'm surprised that people are surprised to oh I'm going to lose my electricity and I'm going to get some water in my house that seems a little not to ...\nTo ... you're exactly right I think people who especially are new to the area I'm a tendency to underestimate their risk sometimes because they they just don't have the experience and um you know they they assume they can for instance they can take their windows and\nUm by some buy a bag of chips and just sit through the event and that will be yet but I'm the the there is always we always stress you know before the hurricane season begins you have a plan you\nPrepare and emergency kit and and it's it's a fence like this where where um you know it comes to fruition\nYeah I Lived through the the tail end of your meal and uh it almost eight my car\nOr is it ... the war way to the side of the of the some land by a stream bed that became a raging torrent and uh uh literally had I if I had not gone to lead the lot where this car was\nAnd moved it I buy my car I could not get into the car and the driver's side but I I moved\nAway from the uh the edge of the water but that that waterway was and this was littered with cars or the next day and this is my ... this was the weekend tale of ... the\nLeg goodness we were lucky portion of meals so I didn't know what I'm Talking about will come back we'll

swap\nThat will take it into South Carolina and the eastern portion of North Carolina our guest Dr Bryan tag is an assistant professor in the department of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University of Albany State University of New York\nAnd they were looking at this storm into in particular is something that you just said that\nIn speaking with our previous caller a doctor tag and that is about our our propensity for building in areas with the frankly just are safe and I've often wondered about that I mean ... when you see a condo that is virtually right on the edge of the of the ocean I mean\nYou are just your begging for a for major problems there and I've I've often wondered why was zoning allows that yes I Know you're right that that we have this desire hey I bought the ocean front well\nI'm Sorry that that's not good enough to me that ... that that's just foolish to ...\n[noise] yeah you do you touch on to the you know important point and and something that I think needs to be discussed foreign that\nUm you know where the terms of um [noise] how people managed or the risk and there there is risk everywhere right there is there's risk to to whether you can live in California there's risk of earthquakes if you're near a fault line [noise]\nUm but in in terms of um who's responsible for um absorbing that risk um we all buy insurance\nUm the federal government a has a national flood insurance program which if you're on the coast\nUm and susceptible to storm surge I'm your regular you know if you have homeowner's insurance oftentimes I won't cover any sort of water damage so you need to buy policies through a federal program or a private company that offers ... flood insurance and\nI'm a sort of who who pays for that that catastrophe poll uh when when that that risk is realized um is kind of a as a subject of rape debate um controversy\nMhm absolutely uh it should do you think there should be a prohibition or uh do you think there should be a changes in in how insurance premiums are structured or or what changes would you make in that regard if you could\nIt's yeah it's a it's a very very um complex question um I I certainly think I'm a you know it's it's really kind of up to how how to state and wants to sort of crafting legislation on terms of um there\nThere are caps on insurance premiums another sort of policies that they can put out there um they come at local local municipalities and areas can put up zoning restrictions um to prevent people from voting a risky areas and ah you know one on one of the things that perhaps

assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast ... by video road will\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so\nOnly about two to four inches of rain however\nAs the system continues to move in London lose that Gulf moisture source\nWell ah to our friends in Europe or you know um you can have whiz we hope you does that does that does that I'm On the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes no guy yeah wow I I did\nI just assume by the time we got to ... probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up yet\nAnd all and and and that's why we're having these storms and the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nA major hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it gonna kinda lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter] yeah yeah right\nYeah and you were right 'cause I I'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just a just personal interest to me and and that is when you get it from ... you know ... ... tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean\nThat a hurricane like this does it then does it as a result that it's taking the energy from the water does the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does is causes up willing or which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters\nAnd [laughter] just letting you know [laughter] might not be good or Easter season right I\nHate the came in in Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and Kate came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach wow the same place wow and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael\nYou know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water and the Atlantic or is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life the span of time but Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always\nOften we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned we this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being over land here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nIt is to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk yeah and that's where I'm concerned about a lot when it goes through no fault that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know\nThat area just floods [noise] yeah and and so I mean we didn't talk a lot about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding in Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on and and and central North Carolina and so it never really picked up any news but\nWhen this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach Norfolk and Hampton Roads area as it probably\nAs it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the into the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right a ... power outages there's there's a huge swath that's going to be\nFrom power outages from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least a pass Wilmington and and just where you start to get into the outer banks islands\nI'm this is widespread power outages then we also throw in here the tornadoes\nNow the tornadoes are kind of different they are\nNormally super cells so where you see the large cluster of thunderstorms which currently are moving their way across interstate twenty a heading toward Colombia and going through Augusta well that's not the likely place where you've got the heavy rain it's where\nThe feeder bands that are probably fifty to a hundred miles further out where there's individual cells and as we start to get into the morning hours where we'll have an an up tick in the uh what's called the low level jet stream and wins and we get a little sunshine we're going to see some\n... some possible super cells develop along in those ... and\nI'm a John Trump touchdown and he said when you get the friction of the land and you get this massive fast rotating storm and it hits the land or it\nKind of dragged to the bottom it creates wind shear and so the the the ah tornadoes are typically week they're F zeroes an F ones and um and they're they're shallow they're short lived and um\nAnd they're commonly in the north east quadrant of the storm so if you cut the storm in four pieces you've got your your northeast your southeast you've got your south west northwest well the the the one that is closest to the ocean and the\nFurther north ... where we see these individual cells and feed her band stringing their way and and so that's the other area where we're going to be watching now yesterday we had a three tornadoes reported two in Georgia one in Florida\nI'm a long and near highway Seventy five as the storm was moving its way through Panama City and northward toward Tallahassee\nInland and the main peninsula Florida that's where we saw those feeder bans coming in and we picked up the the the tornado activity but as as this entire system moves forward we've got\nThese threats one or the winds are going to topple trees trees are going to topple power lines a power lines means widespread power outages over the central sections of the Carolinas and possibly into a southern Virginia than we have flooding\nAnd that flooding is going to be a a long and through Fayetteville to the west as we get up into the hill country I call it\nA rally and so forth that area is is is perfect for flash flooding because there's all kinds of hills ... ravines and so forth hollers and that all\nCreates its own issues the flash flooding and it doesn't take a lot of rain considering all the soaking it has had [noise] and and then beyond the tree toppling the power outages and the tornados that that we have with this thing um you know it's a it's a pretty complete storm\nAnd it it has enough energy to maintain itself as a tropical storm until it gets out of here leaving Virginia Beach and heading for the are heading for the other side of the pond\nWow wow just incredible energy behind the storm and of course ah just unbelievable devastation in the wake of Michael and and a much of that will still have to be assessed as the sun starts rise or in what is now that that path that the that Michael took\nA and I were just looking at at one website uh and and the power outages here reporting in the hundreds of thousands of course of seven hundred yeah uh being affected here and they they send it for some of them it could be weeks\nAh I yeah I remember my ah my brother being affected they go to higher ground from their storm there on the Gulf Coast of Texas a and they went in they went inland but uh they couldn't go home for her it was a couple of weeks just for them and that storm was into the size and intensity that Michael was\nAnd so it could be weeks and weeks before some of these customers have power again right coming up here and just a little while\nComing up here and just a little while we're going to get back

or or playing a various ah market games or or not or shall we say your hobby but the fact is that we are all our economic beings to what extent or another and this is the kind of thing that comes seriously affect your life\nLet's talk to or not only our guest Jordan Goodman America's ... was mad but to see but who goes in for medicine lodge Kansas good evening Steven\nIt isn't the gym or remember one night in\nA very for those who don't know that Steven was in the same unit I was in in in Vietnam but to go ahead\nYeah but you are a suffer in\nIdaho I I was I was actually listed also but anyway what do you have for what do you have for our for our guests\nAbout goal it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old and\nHero and uh I uh\nIt's always been holders value for me uh it's it's really a\nState they're saying or get terrier rated in the last year and I was wanting to know if it if he feels it still place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay it's it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up gold goes down as do many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting gold gold gotten over Thirteen hundred thousand ounce\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that so I I don't say it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters of the world and gold is not growing up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new\nKind of safety valve and even that haven't been working lately as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same Silver's ... gone down dramatically a platinum as kind of a of a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker lately so none of the passion smells really been doing much they all get hurt by rising interest rates Jim\nOkay very good I thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your services well now a\nThis is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these around certain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing decently we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when it looked like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah no goal just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with\nA interest rates and I mean the founders arms raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury is now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it's not a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe the three and a half percent by the end of the year that was all bad for gold silver platinum and let him\nRight but do you see a ... going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peaked at about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though it was about one in three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to\nAnd I think it's going higher let me just a brief explaining why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve is doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve\nOr out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not in that fire for political reasons another way to get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bonds sixty billion a month through the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's been over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing quantitative tightening so when bonds come do they're not buying new ones they're not renewing them letting them mature\nSo two of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim we've talked about this before but the evidence that we have are being financed with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars in New that just that quarter alone\nToday there are options of the thirty about on the ten year bond they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficit so more supply less demand\nYields and we'll go up and prices go down\nThere you go the old supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to the more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break going to take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nOne eight six six

say that uh our project in literature I always you know their way okay so I'm interested in that well that's fine but but but you shouldn't be paying off this kind of enormous money\nTo finance a hobby and as I've also noted before that's why we have somebody bowling leagues in this country people like to bowl\nAnd there are just simply an awful lot more people who like to bowl the people who can make a living in the professional bowling to her and so I mean is it just always it amazes me at all these people who want to find myself or I Want to do this or that well why don't you do that in your spare time and in the meantime get a job yeah\nWell I mean luckily we have a good employment situation right now and and there's a tremendous shortage of workers except the people coming out of college and when I cases are not qualified or willing frankly to do the jobs that are available\nThere's something called the jokes report which is the job openings long term survey and the latest number was six point nine million jobs unfilled employers cannot find the people\nTo do tool and dye making are plumbing or electricity or climbing electric utility poles there may be the people coming out of college don't either have the skills or the interest in doing the jobs that are actually available in the real world\nWhich raises another point is too easy to sit on your butt in this society they're out of the economic pressures on people like\nIf you're ever while student loans you are under economic pressure to do something and a lot of people take jobs that are like but I've got a service those didn't know that over fifty percent of the people graduating today go back and live at home because they can't services student loan debt and have an apartment in the car and kind of get on with their lives I mean it's pretty pathetic\nOr if you wind up doing doing a job you're not particularly fond of a because it pays the bills this was I think called growing up we'll ...
