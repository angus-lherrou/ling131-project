Tripoli eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five and we're going to go to Patricia who's on the line in Tampa, Florida how can we'll\nThank you for taking my call jerks that's not really so\nYou haven't read a book you know London has um I'd love to do that function without wellness center ourselves off or to God but financial quilting and other things to cook for physical mental and emotional health\nBut I think about selling my house buying and he'll play you know where I live up there and it will be the center like concern that that is that um oh what there is some sort of liabilities\nWell go ahead\nAnd get someone who was that get hurt a lot I Know that could apply for the and they go after that if I were to go so they will go after the fitness but if I Lived in the same building what that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be an issue\nWell you've got a couple of things going on here put chicken I Want to own a a little bit of time on each of them first of all I'm probably gonna be state specific so you definitely need to look at the laws and your state in any type of regulations\nI'm you're going to have liabilities regardless whether it's a standalone studio or it's where you live so you're you're going to have liabilities if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you have a product that type of things do you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge him one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here's a traditionally encourage people to do\nBecause you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have any idea of validated I Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller and a little sooner\nI'll give you an example where is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base in their off hours build your brand builder demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justifies you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live above or your own stand on space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches\nThat will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary schools the elementary school right next to our house will they don't have school on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd it's just great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it and I've seen a lot of businesses do that so\nI don't think your ideas a bad idea I Would just challenge you to start smaller and sooner on a lower risk level lower costs level and validate your idea\nAnd build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you don't really want to look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment [noise]\nPatricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was the question I work full time and I am going to Iran and on I was planning on going back ... to share and that way I'm I'll be making more money but it'll help make a fund and like business as well\nYeah I well of course you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you would try to go right on open it right um I I just want to see maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three moms when I see if you can get a small group to pay you\nBecause it's everything you just said but it allows you to tip to into it uh the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is going to lower the cash flow of more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean ... you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business or like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you are and what you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the park outside\nGo to the park outside their calming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to have a location before you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow but to get out of your living room if you want to or the heart and down the street\nAnd by the way you should go ahead totally\nYeah yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the ... you are the business point people don't care an hour and ... enjoy it to come in for you they're not coming for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ten Komen crispy rice sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour take your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we\nHad a crush on her to get you get stuck on how can we do well\nI've been on the chief field for about Twenty years and to the point it really hasn't been I haven't progress as far like where am I originally hoped and wish that was\nA long story short is I'm back in January wife and I went through a pie view and as we're about to a baby steps round except to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff to get a garage sale go on a we came in to some old home movie a fish from stuff that she'd go from ... bad um when he had died um and\n\nThrough all the things we found you know we have a lot of old eight millimeters old VHS raw stuff and it's like okay we have all this stuff [noise]\nUm I started to averting it and I really found a passion for that that I have an ad in the first part of ... and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn it triggered business I Love doing going forward\nI'm struck at this point they let\n... let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the military or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy format like later VHS ... cells law that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then um we bought a question I have is just um how\nTo get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping throw it a properly and in the\nUm ... or tell you what Bill crush the\nBill ... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we may help yeah here's the thing about the great news and it's\nA when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent so you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses that have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve I Am and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language\nThat speaks to them right where they are to the best part about this bill as you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do is you're going to build your business and you're gonna get better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself\nIn that market a bell I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps and we'll get Wilson that you sent your women's\nRight to great plans will follow it and and here's this thing a ... a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting he finds these old things and you realize way out this\nAnd and you are giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I Want to just had when they try it just tested on the channel that is trying to last call here's why some passion should be hobby\nThings when you turn it into a business that\nYou made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it and keep paying him until others have you need is done me tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away something about it stopped getting whammy just you just do a triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise]\nDon't go anywhere\nYou've heard me talk about our deep ...\nTalk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity theft last year yes sixteen million\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or those something you're running independently already or do they go through the main company has paying your salary\nSo they're different companies OK I'm here yeah two of them are kind of actually my own project I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is there a company I used to work for ... years ago that you contract court for perfect I mean they don't have that salary yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing without having a boss that kind of back\nMe and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways to your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand that client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interest of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run\nAs an independent person you're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your full time job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is they are of course that's only going to help and your husband has income\nSo you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients you're working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first of the year you probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nAnd it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days maybe step stays baby steps on the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience lays on her way\nThe light at the end of the tunnels and important point can cause so many people feel like how can I sustain this well you're not still January when you ... you know this is the first season him to put my head down for a season them and had the rewards and it's worth it seems right\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\nHey how you doing guys um okay so I've been in the field for the past Eighteen years and ah I Love the field the past six years I've been doing the security um which I Love even more\nUm I feel

of the stuff that was laid out in the story a expert seem to agree well past them time limits been up\nSo investigators are probing it or we know at the state level of New York's looking into it more important than that would be the IRS decides to look into which I think that that's been requested by leading Democrat on the Senate Finance committee but\nIt's you know unlikely to see that take off you know considering that President Trump can self appointed the head of the IRS who was concerned very recently um you know so it's it's unlikely ... you would see something or go down that that

Michigan Chris welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\n[noise] hey how are you good that [noise] ah\nWell I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that the whole reason\nThey held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings by a claiming that he gets kinda partisan and attacking them is that they didn't think they were actually gonna be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh\nSo what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward there on a plane he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or abstained from any votes\nThey would be worth anything they want to but they they don't they can do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they did a great male adults roll your cell screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere can't get anywhere with it\nOK because I've heard lawyers you know\nTry and no sure that judges short recused themselves Oh yes our well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way the Supreme Court justices are seated than we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were review even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I\nCan't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they receive the down the it's got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it or\nOr there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the economy at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them that's not going to hold any water\nYeah uh do you remember when they talk about ah you know is nomination this is back during the Gorsuch nomination process uh the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like okay [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company\nIs indirectly working with my brother's company and that and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that ah well she's part of his family\nBut the the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break there is a great deal of respect by everyone that she does on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we don't agree with in fact the uh well I can think of three that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John\n[laughter] but we can talk about that but the procedure on procedural issues\nIt was all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with a ... a it is not it is not driven like the social media world of today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with ... often out of context or they did that with Scalia\nOr but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nBut I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world\nThat I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in\nFor example most people don't know that a former Justice Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great on money to make that their ... their their family their families used to vacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find\nTwo polar opposites [noise] so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe\nAbout the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because they don't even\nTo the door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two cigarettes\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is\nIf this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the ... came out what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up because the claim would be in the three oh two except if they found that they couldn't find any anyone with first hand knowledge of the event\nOr the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then\nThat you take something like that a simple plain that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there\nThat background checks are done how many thousands of claims that are on cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction as well as journalists core and then learning\nOf this this rule now it puts it on and the prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never it would if you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... you were not would not have been able to cooperate and then at that point\nIt dies just like probably the thousands of other allegation s ... you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades and that's that's it\nBecause you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now it makes sense as to why Feinstein for her\nFeinstein for her politically white worked to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it now you know why Lindsey Graham

they have a mask on evidence you and really they are they out of the government that they get ... by the government I mean look at how the Russians train\nThese kids to hack at such a\nSuch a young age which is a great idea for that phone hacking but it's not a great idea for unethical hacking and we we need to train our children a lot more\nAn ethical hacking so they can do great defense is that we have to have ethics and this is the\nProblem we we almost to the point where we would have to have a world cyber courts and you start getting into politics and and and bad actors that are acting like good actors and he's right on the money I mean I agree with him completely I'm just trying to add that they they might look like outsiders\nWhen really their insiders and talk about Russia all day long I asked her\nWell let me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up a is there any such international body there is of course the world courts and there are various or a bodies of United Nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to\nTo depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but didn't end up at best and the and the hospital to U.S interests that red worst but I I Am curious if it's such a pug bodies even exist usually\nLaw and regulation trailed far behind technology especially in this day and age\nNow you're exactly right and it it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because there is a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious plateau suit that side of how we all get along by uh I I don't want this weapon given\nA to anyone that's not mature enough in the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech\nThey will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should a control most of this still\nAnd and we're seeing this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we have unwittingly put all our shifts and one big cloud and so if you can puncture that you can get a huge windfall you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything by paper [laughter] because it was harder to scoop up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held accountable for the bad actors are in locations they are making a fortune outfits that\nLine is acceptable normal something that's so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country you just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations will forget it or maybe they have but it's just so far\nAway it so far yeah I think the real solution is going to be technological\nYeah I Would have to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of vote will paper is oh so Tony a century [laughter] well you know what a there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that uh we're better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point of like for example\nAh it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results or what someone could hack and and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail rides there of how people voted\nIf somebody ... something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant and I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or ... well boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span we sure don't like the way for people that counts I don't want it to the baby
