on this edition of voice of America our next stop all the Iran\nDeal also go down to Brazil and talk to a first time voice about their election day and is it another one of these changes hard situations for the largest country in one of the largest economies in the world certainly the largest\nCountry in that continent and we are seeing what we've been seeing for a long time now never forget or two years ago if you're a long time listener to this program you'll remember that we were talking to folks of course outside the United states about our elections this is what it was down to Hillary and it was down to Donald Trump\nAnd uh\nWe had several people that were telling us we're outside the United states Trump will win and I certainly didn't expect Trump to win and I was questioning them and say you know why why do you say that what do you think that and uh they said because it's already been happening here\nYou know so it it that that's always that always resonates with me and it's easy to get distracted by that and to think you know if it's not happening to me if I haven't had that experience\nOr than it there's no way it can be true I Can't imagine it I'm not creative enough I Can't expand my mind enough to understand something different may be happening but they were explaining of course your breakfast had happened six months earlier for instance across Europe\nAnd in some of the smaller European nations not just you know France and Germany or they had seen this this uprising of these uh of of parties are just the radical change not the fake changed\nNot the nonsense that had been ... been passed off as your previous generation of you know oh we're a change agent we're going to come in here are really changing that of course we all know is just more of the same\nAnd they had seen it you know the United states likes to\nUh oftentimes think that you know they they invent everything they started everything they're the they're the vanguard of everything\nAnd then often times that is true but not always and this was the perfect case uh\nSo we're gonna we're gonna go back and we're going to find out some more as we find out what's going on with the Trump of the tropics and if it is comparable and if we are going on the cusp of seeing nothing's official yet the polls are open as we speak if we're we're going to see something similar to Brexit or Trump\nOr going on in in Brazil and of course what it could or could mean a for this uh this anti establishment real change a movement\nOr an update and we will have more to one of our global media spotlights about the care of and moving from Central America up to the United states southern border\nAnd it is a story that we talk to Caesar from Honduras about last week if you missed it I encourage you to listen to it because by all indications this is where this caravan was a strong word began\nA and the it was in Honduras as we speak right now by again all indications are that it's a it it's still in Mexico still quite a ways away from the United states southern border but there are lots of obvious questions because the politicians and the activists the organizers they're basically all politicians\nAre we have to ask obvious questions you know how does a caravan start how does a caravan become a caravan how is the caravan organized to the extent that they can get up in March literally for days or weeks if they make it up to the United states but who's just standing them who's organizing them who's feeding them who's offering them security how does it happened and that of course the obvious questions to\nWe've got these governments whether it's the Hungarian government whether it's the Mexican government whether it's the American government they all claim\nThat they've got immigration policies they all claim that they've got security that is reputable\nAnd ah then ... you know we see them say something and then on the ground for all practical purposes it doesn't reflect the rhetoric of course that they're saying so we all play this game where we we've learned relatively quickly you know if indeed it's a situation where you know some person says I'm trying to seek political asylum\nIf you live in a country that you know open and respect human rights you know the idea is that if somebody says I Need asylum\nThat first country of entry it's supposed to be you know the the the the place where asylum is granted but it just ... you know we get we all talk about we go to the United nations every one of the United nations says this or\nYou know ... there's all these organizations that are formed it's nice and they've all got names and they've all got your decrees and they've all got their constitutions and then the reality on the ground is often in life is far from what everybody talks about in polite circumstances an air conditioned to ... officers an arena\nAnd so this is the case here but\nTo update you Mexico\nThey do have a plan and the outgoing president that's an ... opinion yet he's got a one month month and a half left ... roughly before a\nLopez Obrador comes in a he says that of course you know we have a ... we've got a plan and we've got a we were listening to Donald Trump of course to not just Donald Trump or listening to his all Trump says look you've got to do this or moving through your country we know that they want to come\nWe're ... we're listening to Donald Trump of course do not just Donald Trump or listening to his all Trump says look you've got to do this or moving through your country we know that they want to come here we were kind of security do you have and what kind of\nPlan do you have for these people that many of them are claiming that you know their their lives are in jeopardy or down in in in Honduras it's not just an economic issues so today we find out about the s just into Costa which is that this is your home in Spanish\nAnd that is what a pig and yet to comes out and says he says that\nFor those who comply with Mexican laws and stay in the southern part of Mexico don't keep moving to the central part of the northern they've got to stay in the south of Mexico offer temporary ID cards and work permits medical care schooling for children the migrants children and housing and local hostile\nAnd uh that's that's the plan\nOf course the obvious question is is what if it has rejected I mean what if the ... the caravan says no no no you don't understand and they've said this uh your plan is to go to the United states so we're just going to use your country as a highway to move all the way through it's not a small country ... goes on a small country it so they're already\nThere they've been there for many days and now they play it I just keep moving through the ... what do you do if they don't take the planes do you then send them back to Honduras you pushed them forward to the United states or did you come up with another plane again that's what's awesome about all of this ... who's in control is the president in control\nOr is the caravan and control\nAnd that's the fault that goes on all the time especially with the immigration issue on America's southern border that's the update there you have it will continue to follow this and you'll hear more on this program coming up\nIn one of our global media spotlight tell foreign media popular corporate media covered the story and uh I think you'll probably find it interesting if you're interested in this story next stop Iran the curious ... the United states now says it may be a game changer for the middle east to America where the world comes to talk [noise]\nAs a veteran of the United states military\nCan finally get the opportunity to enjoy special things that we couldn't afford thanks to vet\nEvery empty seat at a concert again for a play as a missed opportunity to say thanks to a veteran and service members we can get out\nTo create their own chairs\nFind out you can make a difference\nFramework those are those are provocative comments coming from those those are messages for the middle east that's that's just for\nSaudi Arabia let's find out what a camera and things from Iran I chatted with 'em right for the program and I started by asking him what the reaction has been in Iran if anything to this ... case\nThough they have not a comment on that of the show the but K hon a newspaper would represent the hotline this need on a has a actually a very cynical or this bonds may be true\nIn the way they had is Suzie at IBM flag and they took the two symbols and they put a a change how on that and that is the funniest and and the same type pods is a response from need off\nToday in Bahrain the American secretary of defense said that if it's proven that the Saudi Government was behind the killing of of the ...\nUm that it could destabilize the entire Middle East does that sound like a politician using hyperbole or do you think that there's something to those words\nI kind of a queen but maybe not the worst thing that is that we live in the middle east but I think it would\nIt would be a huge question mark on Tuesday at IBM intentions in in the in the region I think that it would damage the strategy partnership between Iran and is said and\nAnd United States\nI think that if they are proven that they were the hand especially if the U.S is the ... they would definitely if back\nIn ... when it comes from\n... does anybody by the Saudi explanation about what happened in Istanbul a couple of weeks ago because even the Saudis explanation keeps changing\n[noise] no they are not a day or making fun of food do you have to be a day are saying that that this is a pat down\nYou know they are not a day or making fun of food do you have to be a day are saying that that this is a pat down that be sci fi or when you are S. O. X. simply kidnapped or a live in nice prime minister and you force him to resign and you\nCould not human rights defenders on on on the highway going uh and then put them in the air flying ... them to sue the area they think that uh the the government of sued yet I've used capable of doing this they believe that they have done it and they are trying to\nTo cover it up but they are also relieved that Iran is very good in covering of all the crimes that they called me they are laughing on soon to be that they spent millions and billions of intelligence but they still cannot fool out one the one uncovered off trade since\nYou know camera you're the you're the second or third person that I've spoken to a about this issue and uh they all say the same thing they all say what this one thing for sure is is that the Saudi Government most likely the prince NBS\n... he's a ... or he's an amateur I mean this was a kid trying to do a man's job and that's the problem is that it's not so unusual that\nThere's pressure suppression or even murder in in countries like Saudi Arabia they should that's not what's unusual usually handle it cleaner you know this this guy bungled the job is that what you're saying\nIt says it exactly what I'm saying and um I agree with you that she's young but he's young and very dangerous\nBecause if you look at what he is doing to the human rights defenders or the journalists ensues yet I've yeah\nIf it's not exactly the same that are Iranian government does the do not this is the is it some time is even worse because they they they ... percent themselves as the format is and then they um they do this kind of horrible crimes\nDo you think the u._s. got fooled because NBS as you know came to the United states recently toured all over I mean he was in New York he was in Washington you went to San Francisco with all the Silicon Valley people he went to Los Angeles Hollywood people and they certainly treated him like he was the king of the world's\nI think he got a better sense on the fault of even better than the option that the biggest part of us which is a British Government and why and\nWhat is what what is it what is it with the United states and Saudi Arabia is it just the oil money I mean is that what it is it's the oil money into the military spending they do I mean this is Don back for so long now you know fifty sixty Seventy years\nIs there something that I'm missing or is this just a very ruthless relationship that is just all about oil and money\nI think big part of it is the money but in the same time I'm ... read don't and I don't personally know any of this kind of terrorist act on\nThis kind of flattening doing other is a teen's a of a food yet I've yeah I think that this new one\nOr the the father is obviously sick and they cannot do anything but his son NBS I think he thinks that he is at all the war because um because of the economy power that they have bought and he'd take accents that is\nA that this kind of a unimaginable how could you be a king of the country and then\nAnd I agree with such a plan I mean or or decided to plan and it was just this is a tough guy and there's a doc is way\nYou know and of course the the question that everybody is asking because this is this this is what we may or may never know but it's it's kind of the obvious question that everybody asked is\nIs there any way in a country like Saudi Arabia the leader he's not officially king but for all practical purposes for the last year or two he's been the the day to day you know leader of Saudi Arabia is there any way NBS would not have known about an operation like this\nI think for a for American public sitting in a in in being getting us may bees or something to think that he's not responsible maybe somebody else\nOr the days but for Middle Eastern like me and for somebody who is monitoring the human rights not test in need on but also in other countries I Would tell you that is absolutely\nImpossible and nonsense to think that anybody that ensued yet I've you would take this kind of accent retired as a highest\nAnybody ... enthusiasm gap you would take this kind of accent retired uh highest person annoying and and to be honest with you if you knew how did that those up right\nThis is a very very clear a accent that they would take to tighten the opposition so it does\nThis has been this kind of things has been done in the middle east for at least last fifty years Iran is in the same time these mass that all of doing Iran has done similar things\nBut there is absolutely no way that ensued yeah that'd be or eat on somebody would take this accent as Supreme indeed the MPs is not know of it or not sponsor what\nA camera in what ... what is turkey during what does it say angle and all of this 'cause they're very aggressive and exposing or at least their side of the story and going after Saudi Arabia\nCooking is playing chess and they are doing so well they are like mass escape\nYeah what do they want the what is it what is it what are they going to use all these cards for\nIt I think it comes to\nWhat the government wanting to be in the middle east and how it is yeah that you want to play that role I think is the\nIs high enough that the competition between the leaders of Islamic world one one of the Islamic world and the other one leader of Islamic for them to the idea is

zero on the continuing education what the United States will do now here's a portion of a program on voice to America\nThe murder of Saudi ... show in Turkey is threatening the ability the entire Middle East that's the view of the U.S secretary of defense James Mattis who says Washington's ready to take more action against those responsible\nThey the clean indication by the Trump Administration that the less the Saudis take me and then they should do is holding this issue in the matter that would say face so they're making the patient as with all the houses are so there's no\nA light at the end of the tunnel and I think that there are a couple of method that went out from the White House for a better now Pompeo before that and that even the way that they ... they\nI think that there are a couple of messages that twin towers from the White House from a massive now Pompeo before that and that even the way that the administration has been dealing with a fella diplomatic level that it's very clear that the Americans are quite unhappy with what's happening they cannot sweep it under the rug and they usually do they need the Saudis to do something about\nUh we seem to be hearing that the options are limited for the U.S in terms of what they can actually do a will fuels you do you think your options are limited old you think the U.S needs to get tough and stop the attention of the crown prince\nWhat happened was ... that that you might have ... is a major issue in that one and two they instilled yet it but when it is coming to get that with the war in Yemen to look at with got that that the entire episode was kind of the\nUh the situation that happened with Lebanon or other aspects of other issues of human rights and princes and other members of the salads and and and other than the business community in Saudi Arabia human rights issues\nAnd one day Sunday is going to become a a quite an action\nAnd I think it's like building up building up and and unfortunately it's west ... friends and they're very gentle a human being and the very wise men who ... who is a a expressed the ... what does all is good for the idea and for the region and a democratic or\nA human context unfortunately it's still cause that it took his life to create a kind of opening for for the whole idea of freedom of expression\nThe idea that perhaps a back to ... the U.S would be there to keep Iran\nWould have been fun to full just four weeks ago but now they're all from circles in DC apparently discussing that do you think that's the best to a ... for the U.S than say perhaps a real long slowly and Saudi Arabia\nThey need to bring back into the ... other than that should apply U.S Congress or the entire operation has to absorb again the whole issue of human rights and that Egypt\nSo a human being I think the u._s. has to look at each state differently so I Would say that is quite a conflict on so many issues with Iran come back to the nuclear agreement try to bring this back to the table or in a in a sense of all the way\nTheir own in Marjah hey we already have not only a poll on that but I as I recall what\nYou've heard ... because he has been saying what are your thoughts that does the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the U.S needs to be reset and should it pivot tools got that on Iran\nLet's say the more of a pessimist yeah a lot I think that it can be to the United states problem with that they're going to kill the dissidents\nOr I Am I'm sure that the American the fish to understand that many of the genes to go with it with your genes and they didn't kill defendants every day the problem is ... how to manage and how as a president or said in\nA couple of days ago that the silly kept kept up the biggest covered up that took place this is the main problem the problem is that their ally cannot manage\nForeign policy can manage its actions in a way that will save face for the administration itself I think for the United states the important thing is to have an ally that his dependable\nScores looking out for me to an escape shelters are covered the story and don't forget that if you missed earlier in our program we talked to one of our voices clamoring for Iran because his perspective if any of it as the same I mean\nThe point is is that what a government murdering somebody like a journalist throughout the middle east in many places around the world that we aren't rich no no no no no that's not the outrage the outrageous is it they bungled the operation so that it wasn't covered up or move smoothly and now which everybody's problem because it's been exposed to the light of day\nThat's the problem or next stop Brazil\nAmerica where the world comes to John [noise]\nHand on time the valleys only only this morning show is Arizona's morning news\nOr you can do three of them Arizona\nSo he he is not that representative so he basically was elected by it to represent the media character in the Congress and during the last couple a years when we started to date each one of the last rather than\nBasically a rate you know a flag about the humidity and\nNowadays as you may know and we have sixty thousand people being heated yearly in Brazil\nSaw that I actually pulled up the number is sixty four thousand people were\nYou sit down and people being killed his yearly in Brazil\nI saw that I actually pulled up the number is sixty four thousand people were reportedly killed in Brazil that's correct\nI mean is that accurate yeah yeah that's correct is that a lot\nIs that this is a lot and actually that it's a I mean nowadays for democratic country and I think that and and maybe and I ... I think I mean a drone but maybe for a democratic country\nBrazil is the I mean the one who was killing more civilians in the world I Would say they'll\nShow is that both in our owes platform is a platform of law and order ... is is that what it is or security is that is that what he's campaigning on his big issue well\nYeah one of the that point he mentioned and I mean one of the most important blackie he race\nWas that Islam and then and\nThis is a goal for change what he was to both himself in the blaze\nOpposite to the mainstream\nAnd people would like to somebody food chain so here\nSo here in the United states for instance is I was doing a little research over the last couple of weeks before I talk to you popular media everywhere\nThey they come up with these little terms whether they're accurate or not one of the terms that the media here have said is that most and are always like the Trump of the tropics is that accurate it's not and\nWhy they would say so and\nBrazil we have different and complex problems differently than the United states to my point of view and one of them is about the one that I mentioned before about security that by far is different from the United states and the other one is unemployment is a ... we have nowadays\nThirteen percent unemployment which for a developing countries law rock for poor country\nOkay so let's take the tuition is you just brought up the murder rate sixty or sixty five thousand roughly a Brazilians died last year why is the number so high\nAnd one of the things that happens in the past\n... to ... the rise of ... and I mean drug dealers and drug cartels and this kind of being so each increases the law the dimmer tied to race based on these you know and groups and basically they're fighting\nWhy isn't the unemployment particular particularly high\nIn two thousand Thirteen to sell them for team and we started and going down a comedy and uh we had 'em for two years in enroll nah negative GDP and and that you know push for the than and find them basically\nAround the globe when you're talking about political corruption it's everywhere but it seems like Brazil has managed to rise to the the top of the list of of of political corruption\nIs that accurate I don't think it's more\nMore than other countries or what I Would say that the Fort Smith is a just charging so for many many years and we didn't have in Fort Smith towards you know the corruption so basically the guys that were to call whether or not and\nAnd and responsible for their acts and\nEach changes in two thousand Thirteen into southern Thirteen to Congress passed a new ... the last company in the ad that we call the Portuguese basically what they did he's using these new legislation to cost the guys and make you know the law enforcement\nTo the ... was the name change the corruption has gotten a little bit better because there's now a ... there's now new laws and those laws are being applied\nThat is correct okay so Luis Ricardo tell me about\nWhat's up this this this at all the people can use on their phones and what role if any is playing to drive Bolsa narrows popularity in Brazil\nAnd what happens is that after this corruption and you know it was kind of do that we had in the recent bass and the Congress passed a new legislation about campaigns that now for me then companies\nTo support you know political parties\nSo money in other words like Fritz to the United states which is very popular here as you have these companies or very wealthy individuals and they basically bank roll a issue network or\nA politician so you there's a new law that says what Brazil they're they're not allowed to do it at all\nOr it's okay not allowed to not at all so\nIf there is a boogie funny or ... around nowadays in Brazil public money\nYeah okay so then these money he's raised it\nThe book is funny or ... around nowadays in Brazil public money yeah okay so then these money is needed over different parties depending on their size and representation in the Congress so both\nAre oh even because as you mentioned he's he's he's his representation in Congress is is is small I mean he's at the bottom of the pyramid I think is what you said\nHe had he even has less of the public money than other candidates could run\nAs I said OK yeah and not only just ... part of the money but also and more importantly ... and because in Brazil what's happening to contain is that and they have a lot in the TVs in to be okay to look at the vision and this the time the candidates have\nOwned it on TV depends on their representation in Congress [noise] so what's happened is that ... particular time on TV was quite quite small\nSo he was almost you know only ... as one of the ... he had he had limited options because of the laws so he turned to social media\nThese just my interpretation and it can happen and it's working for him no money and we now come on TV and he tried to do was to move to Internet and it's we're in a speech where are you well\nYeah does it does it indicate that he has a wide variety of people in Brazil I mean ... large demographics that are supporting him\nYeah actually if you look at the there is any progress very very informative or from President newspapers who shows that he pretty much one in from in the south south east and\nThe middle of the country and he lose\nYour loss in in the first trial in the north east so basically you have the more educated people more well people while the the second Kennedy and have you know the bottom of the pyramid economically speaking and those that are less educated as well\nWhy do you think that what he campaigned on or at least some of the rhetoric that he has used was only for campaign purposes\nHe does have this or to do that this is why you leave that he's not going to do that because most of these and how can they say and people who are voting for him\nAnd those who work for the beach in terms of ... or any kind of you know and lack of democracy that we have seen and having in I mean the the increase of democracy we had a surgeon the good groceries so then I mean he we will have a\n... from the inside so I said you know what I mean I mean people are voting for him not the cause of team\nJust [noise] but the pulse of the change [noise]\nThat's the least Ricardo from Brazil first time voice on the voice of America program on the elections that are underway as we speak right now when you hear the same thing everywhere you go around the globe people are voting because they want change not the fake changed not the people that talk about changing it it's it's almost similar to the very end when I when I was talking to try to understand it's like it's not that people are\nSo thrilled with both in our our ... thrilled with what he says or how we act just like what else are we going to do [noise]\nAnd when you look at the level of corruption and the law
