left can cough I'm part time I checked my income is law and I happened to Iraq on quite a bit of credit card that over the past five years to turn a horrible spending habits\nAnd um lately I have found now ... lounge chair have our own ... credit card\nThat no longer are ... ...\nYeah how um altogether right now I got about fifty nine thousand dollars and buy 'em by having student about Seventeen out that in a car loan and then and Bob and credit card so\nMhm [noise] so you have a question\nYes my question is I'm obviously he said I Know yeah okay [laughter] no you cannot use student loans to pay credit cards\nOkay do you have any advice on my income about sixteen and twenty thousand dollars a year with my major thing I'm sure it's kind of a manageable right now\nMhm okay well you're first goal is of course to eat and keep the lights on your second goal was finished school when we finished school\nUm I Will be finishing next summer\nSo buddy out at about a year okay less than a year good so you can tread water till then an ad no more new debt that's a victory\nOkay then the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on their credit card just minimum wage and we'll call that a victory uh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on those you don't you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nRight like like the kind of I only have like extra pay off credit card you know how to study and\nIt's a really really dumb idea behind you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards\nAll I Know you haven't caught them all up [laughter]\nYeah I don't in fact my which\nI don't care if you use them or not drop 'em up I'll stop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because they're my score agile and out of the things that probably make about ... an area where I'm located\nOkay well I a little more money on another thousand dollars a month to change your life now\nSo that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully would they knew\nI'm with a new job and a new career at that point um\nHang on until then and stop borrowing on student loans to pay off credit cards Naomi is in Seattle hey Naomi how are you\nAn editor thank you sure how can I help um so my husband runs if not they've been from home and it

I'm going to be done about that ah we have a call from dark who calls in from Wilmington, Delaware to speak with our guests are Peter Wallison than the good evening doc welcome\nThank you for taking my call is ... just a one or two quick questions for his team atrocity all hell just genocide unless of course as always\nMr lost and where do you see this court has got to President Trump on her opportunity under us as a score such conduct Kavanaugh and if there is no justice appointed a say a second trumped are hard to tell us why did\nYou see this court filing turning back to the it out of the cameras are not are you hopeful for the future outs are what are your thoughts on that sir\nBut you did you have two questions that that was just that\nWas ... where do you see the court going on to the justice at all for the future that we could turn back the tide I Would say almost fifty years\nAll right very good of a ... so you're going in other words I yeah I Will go to Jim Cavanaugh tipped the balance and to actually show some judicial fortitude\nYeah I actually think that this is very very hopeful\nI at in the book I talk about the position of each of the justices but I say that with the appointment of Kevin ... there are five justices on the court who I think are ready to modify some of the major decisions that\nHave led us to this position I'm the one that is most important here is one called ... the Chevron case or Chevron deference where the court many years ago in Nineteen eighty four\nA declared that the lower court had to defer to the to the interpretations have various agencies of what powers they had been given by Congress that's very strange\nBecause it leaves the courts out entirely and so that that decision in particular has been a warrant for the agencies to increase their powers tremendously and interpret the authorities that they had gotten from\nCongress or to grow their powers now with Kavanaugh there\nHe's a constitutional list he's a text you list just just like Gorsuch is and the other three people including especially Justice Thomas who I I dedicated the book too because he has always been concerned about this question and now he has\nOther justices I think on the court who are ready to take the steps that Alexander Hamilton expected them to take when he wrote that ... that the federal is Seventy eight paper that I've that I've named the book after\nA while it's remarkable that you know I understand Congress being leery of hot potatoes it's cowardly it's chicken but that is understandable they have to face the voters the courts don't what what are they so reluctant about\n[laughter] [laughter] I think they really are concerned about not having any a direct support from the public\nThey don't need support from the public I mean we don't even associate with the public they and they have their own circles for cocktail parties in the like\n[laughter] I agree that there is of that but Alexander Hamilton\nUnless it was right and when he talked about fortitude because he was saying yes okay the courts are independent and the reason he was writing about it is because he had he had been asked why are you giving the courts the judges lifetime appointments in this democracy\nUm why shouldn't they stand for election and the argument he made in this federal is Seventy eight is they need lifetime appointments so they can stand up to the elected branches\nIn a democracy the elected branches the president that Congress are bound to have more power because they're speaking for the people\nThe courts are only speaking for the constitution\nI'm so they had been since that\nThose decisions in Nineteen thirty five\nAnd the effort by the president after that to a point seven new members and that's changed the entire nature of the court um they had been reluctant to take on the elected branches so that I think is the reason and we have to get the courts to start doing\nThat well we certainly do Alan on the road in South Dakota tonight gleaming\nMayor thanks for taking my call sure [noise] [noise] yeah I just mentioned just turned it on here and I didn't have an [noise] but uh your guests mentioned I think you know he said that ah\nWhere Republican Mark sooner agree with what you know kind of the\nTime frame on each side of the problem started you know it's all full around that time learn from what I've read where you started became you know people started calling us democracy is not a Republican I Do since then I've heard your guest said several times referring to our democracy\nWell I mean look at one of the ... we have a representative democracy that's why although and maybe that's because until recently it has not been technologically feasible for us all to have one great town hall meeting or we will now of course read the point where those technologically feasible although I think it would be a terrible idea\nUm we can even talked about that a bit later on but but the point is we have a representative democracy that is the republic we elect people who make these decisions that's how it works\nOr anything you want to add to that though Peter\n[noise] no I think that's exactly right I think ... many conservatives I'm afraid and I'm certainly one of them many that many conservatives are afraid of the term democracy but we have to understand that the that the founding fathers actually thought of the people governing through\nA legislature and the legislature being elected by the people would make the major decisions that is still a democratic structure\nAnd so conservative should not worry about calling something a democracy\nThe democracy that the founders didn't like was a democracy where ... which is called the direct democracy where the people make the decisions themselves immediately in in in some kind of um ... uh a conference or structure but that's not what we\nHave the old town hall meetings in the ... you know we'll loves a good idea that's right but we'll we'll get we'll come back to them it's time allows but right now I'm calling from Sharon in ... Missouri hello Sharon the go ahead\nYeah kinda Dan ... Mr wants and maybe I Am right off base back um\nThere is a movement could have a constitutional convention and one a couple of the things that I Hope comes out of it if we do have one that we had ... term limits for\nThe legislative branch and the reigning power of executive orders as the president now if that is Dan\nAnd the legislature cannot I guess you have to worry about running for office and is there like it\nWould that change that balance so that the courts possibly would a nanny stat that to the plate a little bit more because it's like we have to take more responsibility All right\nWell the way the way I see it in the way I discuss it in the book is that if the court actually step up and say that certain laws that Congress passes have passed too much legislative power to the executive branch if the court to ... or ... would actually say that\nThen that would force Congress to make these decisions itself\nThe ... for Congress as Jim had said before is that it's too easy for them just to pass on to these agencies all of the major decisions\nExactly to be made for the ... coming up in a break that doesn't move here so we will amplify on that but when we come back in the moment Arizona\nArizona's news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F. M. K. T. A. R. dot com and streaming live on that Katie a our news\nFolks Dave Ramsey here for my friends at imperial wholesale one of the best ways to keep your home up to date is bought upgrading your flooring and counter tops from my friends at imperial wholesale\nSince Nineteen Seventy seven the imperial family has been shopping the globe\nWell or the comments that I made were in regard to those with that viewpoint that to the constitution a is a a document that we can make up as we go along if we don't have to like what's in it it's not a view I happened to share but that would allow people to follow that was right and\nI just thought it would be the fact is is yes it does it change will dark but the only the voters of the coast they love to change\nWell no actually the voters of the country don't have any direct say so in changing it there are methods that involve both uh uh usually we have used the constitutionality of the Congress although the the the conventions could also be the method are proposing\nA constitutional amendments and then ratification could take place through three quarters of the state legislatures or through a a convention held in three quarters of the states the voters per se do not have a direct say so except insofar as they elect the people who do have a say so uh Peter\n[noise] yeah or that that ... exactly right that had to have a system with ...\nUm but it it's a important just to understand we have been ... that the procedures in place the mechanism in place to govern ourselves and we are not allowing it to happen we're allowing the government to slip\nAway out of their hands into the hands of bureaucrats in Washington yeah that's the problem\nThat is the problem but of course it's a problem that will not be going away until the people who are quite

administrative\nStage in his new book judicial fortitude from encounter books and uh we have a call from a sigh in Akron, Ohio and hello side\n[noise] Hi my question relates to the vast power trophy hunter Ryan think in the\nDepartment of interior Hansen soon he has gotten fifty one Republican senators and two hundred and twenty Republican Congress person to to to allow trophy hunters to Ariel national park in Alaska any is down there in regards to sea lion murdering\nGay well before we go too far off the deep end of pizza there ah I'm not sure that anything that has been done in this particular case a illustrates the point that we're making tonight to Peter and in fact a if in fact Congress went along with it however a wise or unwise decision may have been\nUh it wouldn't be the subject that we're talking about tonight I don't believe\nThat no not unless it was an action that was not the rise by Congress this is exactly the kind of thing that could happen if Congress hasn't authorized it um and one of the problems is that this very general legislation that Congress\nPasses sometimes allows administrators even conservative administrators to take things into their own hands and do things that Congress had never intended\nExactly it even in that in fact that's what we're talking about them that would be unfortunate but if there were specific authorization by a majority of both houses of Congress it\nIt it uh a ... in other words if the authorization will specific enough than you would have had in effect a law uh presumably that was passed Gary in Butte, Montana good evening Gary\nGetting ... thanks for having me on the shores pick up things and then get on on\nYour your I agree with almost everything your guest has said I'm a minor point I I Believe we should call it a constitutional Republican and instead of a Democratic Republic but that's my\nMy ... years and I think it really is we're getting into some addicts federally\nYeah yeah yeah it it doesn't mean something to me but I don't have the time to ... to explain it on your show but anyway um and then the the\nThe the main thing is that I wanted to call about is the constitutional convention and that that is something that we definitely do not want to do there's there's conservatives out there that wants to do this and think I think\nIt would be a very good thing to do but I I agree with your guest it could be a runaway costs just ... read the history of our convention they weren't supposed to um go off and write\nA hair but you're not going to get anything that would be authorized but it's such a convention that could take effect without\nActually having thirty eight states ratify in one form or another and let's not forget the articles of confederation were falling apart at the time that that happened and I would I Would just add one more thing if in fact we don't go that route\nThen most of the major changes that need to be made right now be a term limits of Congress be at the no budget no pay for Congress\nBe at a a an amendment that would say that Congress may not pass a law that affects the general public that doesn't affect them equally all those things you can forget about\nWe are at an impasse and the mechanism as it is has currently been used it's already it's in the constitution but as it has been used debate we're all amendment to start with Congress then we can forget about any of those things ever happening a\nBeauty let me add one thing there Jim I and I think much of what you said is something I agree with but\nLet's focus instead of having an argument about whether we should have a constitutional convention let's focus on something we can do now because I think we are headed for some serious trouble unless we start raining in these these\nBut how do you ... how do you were swayed short of of of some method of of of force ah ah how how do you persuade the uh current judiciary and Congress from changing a path that they have gone down for decades and which they are quite happy with I mean so they're not\nI just suddenly say gee Peter you're right you're going to have to armed with these people are gonna have to drag them and I don't know how you do that just by saying please read this book is a great read but I don't think I'd want to do [laughter]\nLet me suggest this and I I I agree that it's tough

won't say we I'll I'll say the impressions that I got one of the things that affected me uh by the time we got to Monday show the one thing that was sticking in my mind I thought to myself\nWow you know what are they trying to sell us and our we buying it\nAnd what they were trying to sell us was um if you believe in due process if you believe in the presumption of innocence if you believe that an allegation alone\nUh especially on cooperated ... um allegations are\nAnd not only that but the witnesses that you use [laughter] don't back you up if you don't buy into that completely the allegation and you believe in due process under the law\nYou are a rapist enabler that's what they were trying to sell the American people\nWill see in a few weeks whether\nA part of America bought into what they were selling the polls so far show that they have not\nThe other thing is we found out that the Democrats really don't have an issue\nWill go into different races and they will talk about some of the issues out there but overall if you were to ask Americans what is the issue that the Democrats are promoting what is the specific issue when you think about this election\nAnd by the way has that question asked in a poll\n\nWhich question would that be specifically about what is the one issue that's driving you to the polls what is the one of the major issues of this election season\n\nTrump bought office besides that what would it be from that because that that wouldn't be an issue is\nThat would just be purely political right in and\nIs a is Thirteen\nAh and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you're very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I asked them questions about their friends you know just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for that Twitter and Facebook not even on the right or not even but\nAlso how things are presented to them\nYou don't want one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was ... they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following week and when she was at the house and then what do you think of that and I said well I don't know\nShe goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah yeah she said\nI said she goes I don't know why they did that I said well why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\nAnd something that was already sad\nThat just one observation again forget the fact that it's my granddaughter ... it was a it was a critical thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are\nBut is that next generation and we've seen it we've seen their studies that show well\nThe ... the generation basically behind a the the college age or college graduates\nNow is showing more critical thinking and and not that they would be conservative but if they are assessing things for what they are instead of the fantasy that the left promotes are they the future\nOf the oil we talked about drawing lumber who is the uh the uh uh a climate a professor that believes that yeah probably a a you know the greenhouse gases are causing global warming leaves it everything the left is doing is actually doing the opposite\nHaving the opposite effect right it's actually producing and we've talked about this before but you just pointed out however ... ways it's the rest of the world is doing the opposite when you when your solutions are making the problem worse but you're signing an agreement\nTo make it better mhm that's considered better than if you're actually don't sign the agreement to do things that will make it worse\nAnd you go out on your own and you do the things that will number one get your cheaper energy and reduce greenhouse gases you're considered the devil right because you won't get along with the\nUh international community and sign an agreement all pretending to do something but if you actually do the things that you wish to do or you claim they're going to do you're actually going to do the opposite of what your original goal was well because we've had a lot of I live\nAnd we've been talking about for a long time the scientific community should be having this discussion not to find who is go ... going to win the debate but to find out if we can actually predict what kinds of cycles coming because that can affect ah that that can affect crops and everything else which can be devastating and also what's\nIt if if man is causing a which by the way hasn't been proven or\nIf

a discussion about uh the\nThe upcoming election and and trying to tie everything in together you know the president talking about\nYou know going back to China and and ah you know starting trade negotiations again the whole ... thing and you made a great point because you're talking about Larry\nSabato the the the pollster on a with a a Chuck Todd ... talking about the that the Republicans looking weak in the in in the mid west and we asked that directly has agriculture has the\nHas the agriculture industry and does that make their money off of it\nHave they you know have they looked at the president said look Republicans ... they they look and they just say we're voting against the party of the president if it's true it's about I was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is it because of the terrorists and agriculture well and and that's it\nUh there are I think right now if you look at the the farming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration or you're not giving the money is saying they would rather have the business or that shows\nThat they believe this could be long term pain for video roadblock here is your forecast\nWe'll see that region today the Florida Panhandle the Big Bend area dry out under clearer conditions good news for the region from Mother Nature we can look at the entire deep south and the mid west today to see clear conditions cooler conditions\nThere is a the chance of some sprinkle some remaining showers today for the Delmarva up through New Jersey and into New York city but

possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the end and it's just\nOne small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sleepy and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely\nDemocrats and one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans\nAnd the center of the toss up district still remains at thirty two two yes by would love to see what's district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those thirty to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo it will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls\nAre and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday\nThings will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact of the capital and the entire thing\nAnd really me and my look at the our CPA for example I mean Montana isn't a tossup state right with test or you know up uh the last one was done not you know nine twenty two which had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was test her up just to\nWhy isn't that a toss up state why is that definitely yeah on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and ... my point is so yeah is the legitimacy of\nThe our CPA average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\nI guess historically tend to shift happened ah with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOr the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven so that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up\nBecause of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point ... my point is that it's\nOur cp has it has definitely blue\nMm\nOn my map is still showing great it's just one great\n[laughter] I didn't get it when it just Web grey eye thanks to the staff at our CPA for ... [laughter] it was it for them aware of what happened it's just when it just went gray yeah All right I'm I'm I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and then what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great ... tiny brain ask myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look\nAnd when you're paws on my way and all of a sudden it updates its gray in front of me yeah because arid Arizona was in grade before\nArizona was like blue which slashes what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to ask that next because it makes Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because ... there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls are going from All right I'm going down memory or ... ... ... and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster\nBut it is a it's it's a pretty big swings so um and it is a it's a different uh the pollster in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the RC piece Senate map and the one next week is the Senate note toss up\nOkay they don't include any taught subset of that is what I was okay that's what I was I had no difference if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right it it makes sense because I was like how can you call that\n... Montana and not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way in it the wrong map [laughter]\nThe New York times CNN poll this life pull that continues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee Blackburn now are on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\n\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on bread ascendant in his volunteers right furious that the fact that he said he would have been divorced Kavanaugh\n... well something's happening there yeah I mean you see\nIn the CNN poll going back to a\nA between nine eleven and nine Fifteen of likely voters and brought us in was up five\nBut all these the polls the recent polls\nAre from last week and this week show Blackburn leading but the New York times\nPoll a ten eight to ten eleven uh the New York times you had to pull for\n... point lead for the Republican Marsha Blackburn\nNuts massive ... in a month that is a Nineteen point swing yeah that's huge definitely is huge\nAre causing comments coming up eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWanting to do for your goals eight six six months he wrote a bone wrote on the radio [noise]\nBe a part of the conversation by calling the shovel to tell a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shut will tell us what matters is inside\nSession will drive now with all the one from PA and ... you can redeem your ultimate points for reserve park that's right now by popular request ultra one members can use their points to pay for a reserve parking space through reserve online more with the truck smart apps\nAnd remember ultra one he's evolving to watch for new features in benefits rolling out later this year because you met her conditions on the ultimate reward chunks on MORNING edition\nAnd jet ski we have hundreds of black beard and specialized million mile drivers white because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national\nPower than we have a long term home for you as the as a family of sixty locally run flatbed and specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada [noise]\nWere you can put down your roof you on short haul or long haul [noise] want to drive our late model truck or your own try do you like to drive ... research team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads the desk the family of companies are your million mile hole if this along with consistent miles great pay and talk to your benefits sounds like what you're looking for [noise] go to Dr Dan ski dot com\nAnd learn more about our family trucking companies find of black beard and specialized opportunity to be fit your needs\nAt ... dot com That's Dr da ...
