I'm Sorry did you complete pharmacy school\nI didn't come here because like in this happened last year um I had got and I had gotten dismissed from the program because I had a a serious highly emergency that kind of jeopardize my feeding and um I had to withdraw my application I'd be kicked out of the program so I have a lot\nOf how long are you in on how long were you in pharmacy school\nOf four or five to four years\nYou were in for four years four years yeah I Want you to do like ... how much do you like ... and\nUm\nI only had three questions left and completing the on campus um of course work and then I had to do one of those patients and then I feel one year you graduate and you have to take your boards and become a pharmacist\nYou know what level of family emerging she would keep you from going across the finish line [laughter]\nWell um I I have a parent that has gone on controlled high blood pressure and diabetes and size maybe suffered a stroke or you know where are you close with stroke and that kind of um\n[noise] had to take on a whole series care and um you know in terms of helping them and that kind of like you don't mess with the times that I had to study for for\nMy my my um studies\nPractices in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Travis welcome to that I ran into hey Dave how're you doing things taking my call I'm sure you've heard a shuttle a defeat for my wife and I was ... or\n... here um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is in case and Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we had an Iran\nThat how about a hundred or two in sort of equipment on a bright one what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the real question that are that are Albert that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and she was my hair and all that in ... and she has to take a certain amount of distribution every year for tax purposes my idea for the inheritance money I'm is who\nWon moms come\nPay off all of our debt and then ... pay ourselves back off of that to an IRA so that we don't have to worry about including repaying the uh interest game if you will or a worry about that that she um you know she is going to come of that rocket for that for our retirement\nUm my record could at it this year forty I'm thirty eight\nWe still have a good amount of time to be putting into our um different finding out you know I get my my question is should we go ahead and take the distribution of our debt so that we're no longer paying the um you know the interest rate or should we go to pay the debt down and we are\nA ... and it will be there for ... would you wanna hear\nWell we've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way\nWealth what is the shortest distance the wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and it's not just one sided it's not all investing mind that it's not all\nThat mind it it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for ...\nAnd it it's not all that mind it it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years in many many people have become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process\nAnd if you're so that the way I Would answer the question obviously me being me is I'm going to tell you use that process and that will answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process was called the baby steps and what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool is your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and ah and the second part of the things driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent have knowledge stuff we're talking about smell really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is\nSo having said that we say baby step one save a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be debt free everything but your house you've not done that\nThree is to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for a start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about who won five or so in our ...\nIf the inheritance was not on the table what we would teach you to do take that down to twenty four through the uh or take twenty four of the twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was Janine right up on your\nLife or a couple of months ago and I'm a went on a on a life in a nice way or no on him or that we're going to go wherever that\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that ...\n... ... you know you got to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so\nIt's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this heritage immediately to become debt free so that you take all those famous as you don't have any more in your years though it was to build wealth with you have a paid for home\nCorrect we we heard it when it\nCame on it and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hundred miles north of ... Seventy five\nHundred and twenty five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution system just taking it\nUm they want her financial grant or told her that she had to do it in a way to um [noise] um that cover her pack a over the fear that hit hard over at the most part because the way the quick money out of out\nYeah it's a bunch of crap um the uh\nOkay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invest it\nShot what would I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm In a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt and I would invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control and know what it is and good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what you all\nTo do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this and to as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do and show them telling you what to do and it's a different different situations so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think you picked him\nAnd um and that's really a bad medicine as well\nNinety percent of the time\nAre you guys need to pick them or you need to re pick him and hiring again and this time he worked for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even ... dead and and that's the way the stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do just catch the\nAnd I think he's still worked for grandpa even grandpa was dead and though that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine Travis what I Would do just catch the whole thing out pay off all my debts and invest the money\nWith what's left that's what I Would do and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand or income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book the total money make over it'll walk you through not only what to do but why did do it\nAnd then you can

autism my biggest concern is that I don't know what happens is the money to five twenty nine plan if she doesn't go to college\nCan you tell me what happens to money not used for education or it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed and penalize it'll be taxed and heavily penalize\nSo um\nKnow the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and we've got a special needs situation like this I Would use the able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual funds and let it grow\nTuition like this I Would usually able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual funds and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future\nOr they may do a trade school they may do or they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing but you simply going to save money\nIt's that simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to\nThe only advantage of the table or the five twenty nine is just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nOr question is is at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count shaving and mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for do all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it were and get my hands on it and I'm I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push it off our twenty nine just those two things\nUh ... in a traditional such a situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefit but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do\nOr let it grow but in the situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the pension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes and and that's the way to work out open phones or triple\nEight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter Dave I'm

a consulate in Turkey of a dissident journalist and we're at one eight six six five oh Jim bode to offer thoughts about this let's start with the Casey in the great falls Montana and the Casey good evening\nYeah I uh I was just thinking that there seemed to in my memory there was a strong linkage to nine eleven with the Saudi regime or at least a portion of the population in\nThat well a lot of the people involved in the plot were from Saudi Arabia to my knowledge there has never been any evidence to get him to the Saudi Government was in any way involved\nLet me uh let me expand upon that point\nI'm not saying that there was any linkage directly but I think that there is a ideology that is exhibited by the Saudis have disdain and disrespect and I don't think the president should go to war or get carried away but he has to\nWalk a tightrope you should send a strong message that they can't just staying here is a\nA presence and his in our nation's help and they're a dilemma mostly that we're helping them with so that's my opinion\nWell All right very good any ah any thoughts are due to the caller\nTemp in trying to think about different things that might can be done also and one might be to significantly limit the number of a diplomatic passes that any of the family has to come into this country at all\nMaybe reduce the number of people at their embassies here or not let them by as much land and property as they would like to buy I mean you know we've got to consider all\nThe potential options that we have to make some sort of statement about this um yes I mean I I see your point there is Jim and now we're talking at the beginning of the show this is an extremely complicated\nIssue there are good and bad and nobody to non south horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it\nYes in some ways and better than us\nKnow how horrible the Saudi regime is but it's better than it\nUsed to be in some ways yes in some ways and better than almost any conceivable alternative on that peninsula of Luke in Madison, Wisconsin good evening\nEvening I'm I appreciate both of your pragmatic approach to the situation but I don't think we should give her a pass to a group of people that intentionally paralyzed someone and tortured them over seven minutes by all accounts\nFor I'm not giving them a mass either I'm just not sure why there is no a lot we can do about it\nAnd that that is what makes this complicated isn't it the brutality of their act\nOr the apparent brutality again what we have so far or ... or you don't pass it on the other ones that are just supposed to be clear about this loop we at this juncture did not have a definitive answer on what happened we have what is looking more and more like a probable outcome if that is true then you would be right but we haven't got that when\nYou look at the Saudi response where they first said we weren't involved and now they say it was a interrogation that went wrong no one gets headed during an entirely\nAgree\nAs soon as I heard that I Know that what that means is they tortured\nHim to death I thoroughly agree on it have you as a as if this was never\nHad lived anywhere else on the planet I Am I'm not using it I'm simply saying what do you do about it do you cut off our nose despite our face\nAt some point when you have people who have sponsored the nine eleven attacks\nBut not wait just a minute or we do not know that the Saudi Government had anything to do with the nine eleven attacks\nWon't feel the information that the FBI reports that and you know that too but that's neither here nor there no it certainly is when\nYou have a ... when you have a group of people that are basically scaring the world to act you have to do something and\n... even even at even to the exclusion of

things either for the people there or for this country\nDo you think it's good to have a government that will take someone ... poetry\nObviously not and I I repeat my question to you in fact I'm going

Powell about\nThis apparent murder in a Saudi consulates in Turkey and do we have a call from Charlotte in Durham North Carolina Hello Charlotte and welcome\nThank you very much and I appreciate it [laughter] and it's real hot but it's the main has been for many years that failed to comprehend it somebody could enlighten me I Would love to know why in the world\nWe give billions of dollars every year to the Saudis Christiana poor reportage she went in undercover in several places but uh you know really she could have lost her life that she showed where\nThe Saudis have fourteen carrot go five states in their ... why are we sending money\nOr there's no question about the fact that they are not shall we say a poor and uh certainly uh although as I noted suddenly Powell\nThey may be useful on occasion is hardly a useful most that would demand or that they get our money that part I must confess or is that is a little hard to understand\nBut I don't understand it all I Know I have absolutely no appreciation for any reason why we shouldn't give them a damn\nYeah again as I say uh if uh they were someone useful to us who needed money that might be different but they are someone who can be useful to us who doesn't need a penny and in that regard I think Charlotte sport is extremely are well taken\nA one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six Rick in Tucson now and the good evening Rick\n[noise] hey Jim of just calling to suggest ah I'm trying to find out of the reason why the ... a wooden just ... when they got this guy on the uh the cost\nThey found out of the reason why the ... uh wouldn't just ... when they got this guy on the consulate\nWouldn't just revoke his path for a which is certainly within their borders Gustavo\nA quaint and that he's violated multiple Saudi law extradite him back to Saudi Arabia he goes into a jail in Saudi Arabia and is a story on eight six\nIn the New York times\nAgain he would be just as out of the way the end I think that the again we have a a very rational thought process from Rick uh get it and less and less we really think of the power that the Saudis deliberately felt that only\nThrough a show of big screen brutality or could they send their message out I mean I Would think that what Rick just described would end up itself be a shall we say I'm a pleasant enough aid to send a message to dissidents\nWell it certainly should have been but this is as you mentioned earlier gentleman medieval sort of regime\nAnd they're barbaric against women and all kinds of citizens of their country so I that's what makes me think this was a deliberate message\nThat they are are barbaric again a is a given a that they were stupid and dealing with the United states this would be a level of stupidity beyond anything that I've ever seen that's the part I think that amazes me\nThat they have generally been pretty adept at quote dealing with the United states and this uh this kind of arrogance or maybe\nThat's why they're calling it an accidental death during interrogation that we're supposed to do everything but killing\nYou know you know the ... that in a number so this is a regime so brutal that they might very well think that that would somehow pass oh okay you were only tried to made me a little bit ah maybe that maybe I'm maybe I'm wrong maybe they are that stupid Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello\nHi Jim I'm not saying that the Saudi Government are nice people or anything like that they are certainly not\nAt that and this this fellow um I Believe I'm came from a family of arms dealers heat within the Saudi Government at one time I think a very close to some of these\nHe's a Muslim Brotherhood supporter he is the other day talking about this that hardly makes him a savory character and that's very true in\nLike a journalist in in Saudi Arabia having the freedom to write in favor of Israel he thought that shouldn't have been allowed and now everybody realizes that\nUm and I don't honestly think that the Saudi Government would have been so stupid it's ... like that because they know it would come back on them and I wonder if there was a rogue elements of course we don't even really and what happened\nNo we don't but when I was thinking about this rogue elements in a consulate consulates these are not just places like boutiques the shopping center where you just wander in\nNow but people can decide to do something that's\nNot smart and I think that the fellow called in about John ranting maybe on something and it may have and then the partly make Trump look bad and dry and make a ... you know because\nI ... that that is the level of Machiavellian thought you will have to explain to me I don't understand and I certainly make no apologies about John Brennan who's been a negative influence in this country for years and years and years but I fail to see\nHow any of this benefits anybody uh on the American left especially given the fact that if in fact he is somehow implicated that this would rebound on uh everybody on the left in the United states I mean I don't see any gain here for the risk of all\nThat I'm saying that right before the

the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race is one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and you got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them\nBeing down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in this and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative Republican positions especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about an attorney at the same job necessarily\nA and that it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of left us than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now 'cause they know\nThat I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's of American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads\nLooked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes Li leaving aside they treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way of announcing that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or video roads blocked\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester and buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of snow with the system\nOn Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the Midwest and northeast in fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure\nAnd that means clear skies rain for Texas continues today we're looking at close to two months worth of rain for some parts of central Texas snow in the southern Rocky's\nA solution to something else so you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage of oh I Would do the same thing I Lived in say in Asia and I kept my kid to have American citizenship if they just born here well I'm going to time my trip so\nThat I have the baby yeah of course they could go wrong if babies late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah getting runners mark\nYes sir hey I'm your on your mark they don't\nWell great I'm well I'm I recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then she ... she left she's gone and it's the fast track to a green card\nNow the ... have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not just touching up from what the previous a\nPrevious speaker was talking about um\nYou know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything and then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever know I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this is this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then they want to just\nStay here and and uh it it it's an amazing\nThing I'll I'll go on my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with lawyer ... everything\nI guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders\nI'm under the way they act as the women against violence I'm ... I'm so if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nMoran Mart\nI keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't suit\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have a illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going on these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and\nGracious we haven't in Beijing going out these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of these other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf it was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America has in the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against him President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issues out at least one of his top issues and the American people responded and I think they did it correctly\nLet's go to somebody could calls here and let's go to San even while loosing Pennsylvania I'd probably miss that up standing around with market\nOh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped enemy territory for a while hopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but uh I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about\nClinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people illegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and I'm\nHappy to stop that and if you remember like during the ah was when we were setting up governments who are in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... you know there are some purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than once and I would say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nWell you you you know the whole controversy over voter id at the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone do you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal you know the oh we're being races were made this you know how could you do that yeah by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort I'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also about uh like you said the\nVoter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes in to vote\nAnd you know that you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting wherever they just\nTake your picture and start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there\nIt's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and say you a digital camera feed it into\nFacial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another ward or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could check and check and see if they voted\nPreviously on that day and age but at the same time he could be starting a voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their dress\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nWell there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... I think he was often often Emily I Know that do but there's another point that you didn't think of I don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls\nOh I ...

eight six six five oh five or six to six online find as a jumbo headed show dot\nCom you would follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox there's parts of the program we're going to be talking to a certain extent\nYou can follow me on Twitter after jumbo talks in this part of the program we're going to be talking to a certain extent about the extent to which were at everybody says all the time\nWhy is it necessary for the national dialogue to be conducted at that volume\nIs it necessary it certainly is a\nConstructive it certainly isn't logical\nAnd yet there must be some reasons why it is happening well we're joined by position and psycho analyst Dr Richard ... who was trained in both ... and the European analyses to look at this through his book out of control\nApocalyptic psychology in the age of Trump and uh we uh we thank you for being with us up to my doctor grade\nNo thank you for having me do you have a ... just as an overall explanation before we get into some of the details behind it why we seem to be out of control at this time\nUh I think that's probably many reasons but the point of the book was really to try to frame the whole political issue in terms of the underlying psychology\nAnd I I think the psychological physicians are probably best trade with respect to the concept of religious conflict\nBecause I think there are many aspects of what's taking place now that really ... uh what goes on between a sectarian groups are out of religious level\n[noise] ... okay I Am a a a a a religious\nLevel all writes a ... ... believes ah apple pie further on that are obviously we're not talking about\nUh two different religious sects per se unless you want to uh uh consider a I suppose the more traditional a Judeo Christian ethic on the one hand as a religious sect and there's a\nLooking back to the gym ... one of these six six five oh jumbo what does that work in this seemingly intractable national discussion about policy and politics\nThings do seem to be as this book is titled out of control Dr Richard ... is our guest is positioned and psycho analyst and the subtitle apocalyptic psychology and the age of Trump or to a rod who calls him from a wire Hauser Wisconsin ... show good evening rod and welcome\nRod are you There God can you hear me yes you're on the radio go right ahead all\nMy phone is like the old well okay\nSure um I I don't consider myself a really good or ill when I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot uh-huh if they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want to ... them and I just think to myself\nWhat a shame they take it out because\nYou know if it got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter or named ... and that way I see it we don't need any with other white\nBut on that cap on hockey or whatever something happened to the poor woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but up to me it's not the issue right here in the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for for all we got to wait until after the election\nBut not out issue with on the other what they get it or they're like\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one vote before it deferring to Dr Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions factions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it is an essential part of society Malcolm faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that\nBut the notion that you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility indicted for to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation ultimately for can unify groups to ultimately ... to smaller division\nLike a logical motivation ultimately for or you can unify groups to ultimately break down into smaller divisions so I I think there's no way of avoiding factions are what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is uh the extremes of polarity between\nFactions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but ah right now call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\nLane on I always enjoy your show in a shake your says thank you will ... when it gets to a point when you go to a restaurant or or you Bill out and\nUh I I don't know if the person or the establishment is the last ... whatever the hell or I don't understand this word once the of\nThe land gets to a point where you can't go out and have reason debate without someone screaming at you spin on the you know\nAnd then you can't I really don't care of your disposition\nJust let's let's have a reason debate I mean if we can talk without screaming at each other ... which I which I don't do and yet I'm the I called the Clinton machine\nThe machine has his just can use to give up the fact\nThat two years ago two years in the ...\nYou know you lost the election of ... I guess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nWell again I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons ah especially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen a ... across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves and ... that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics\nOf a silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people [laughter] but that is that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective but you are so fewer and you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else than the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as in my book is do arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you're ready to several important points or whatever the points that try to make in the book has to do again with the underlying psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's been said for some time now that there's an increasing degree\nOf of nauseous is within the society and in the ... to be increasing decree of moral perfectionism and obsession all thinking in society\nAs a result when when when one counted as those types of psychological structuring individual uh those individuals are very prone to what we call projection and that is that they tend to\nUh take aspects of their that denied a self makeup and to place\nThem on people around them [noise] ah\nSo you have a group like a anti FAA are claiming that the anti fascist and you look at that behavior it's very very obvious that the behaviors that you have your one would expect from the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left\nOn the ride for everything that they're doing a and and denying that are claiming that it's the rights\nTo doing it so that's I think the motivation for some of this behavior or in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today is\nLack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are currently\nOn the books are from a place like a Portland for for the mayor of pointing to sit by\nThere are ... that are currently on the books for a place like Portland for for the mayor of port to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah a again it it it is not something that uh that that can can possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought the rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass or behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is it is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nWho's teaching yeah go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it it's the role of the Gulf than a booth at the local level and the federal law enforce the laws of the country and if they fail to do that you can expect a increasing outburst from these groups because they're essentially isn't able to behave badly\nExactly are we are supposed to be telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond positively win or are they are told that their tactic\nIs uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\nArizona's news station Katie a our news\nOn Ninety two three F.
