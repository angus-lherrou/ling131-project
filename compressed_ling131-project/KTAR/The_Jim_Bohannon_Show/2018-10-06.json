Ramsey your closest you show America\nYou are with us thanks for your open bones AAA eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five\nFive two to five\nBrad starts off the hour in Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the day Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] [noise] Hi thanks for taking my call there sure how can I help\nI have a question are we are my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to uh we've got about Ninety thousand in\nAnd we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have come your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to go a trailer\nHer car she\nOwes about eleven thousand on and ... percent interest we could probably get by just sharing my two vehicles [noise]\nUm but we've just been since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because of course are\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worse\n[noise] um the truck is probably worth about ... to ... my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell her for about ...\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though so we're good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than the eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but not that includes the car the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\nThe student loans or we have some tax stuff um medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes yes and um that would mean that if you want to keep her car there's nothing out of line with keeping it but just right off I mean\nFive to to buy a new job and we'll talk about your life and your\nMoney Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking to you for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college planning for my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old\nAmong baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage\nAnd when I bought it I put Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have no equity\nIn it um and I had about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old\nCollege fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him in and kind of picking out some growth stocks mutual fund to see where it goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of piled cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know every any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shake shack draw towards my how he owns a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is ... dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um because that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now or what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year\nThere's the household income yeah yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well I'll tell you that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of the the robo advisers for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in row boats at this stage of the game there'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would just go to mark pastor Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business so I don't care what you do okay I don't affect my income at all\nBut I people always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down\nIf a teacher that will sit down with you you and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old\nAnd but that gets you there are fifty five hundred is eleven thousand and that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds I spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and gross a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international now once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got eight and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that and that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is addressed kids' college and it's different being there in you know ... how many kids how old they are and that kind of thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget them all the ski jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional from a service academy at three years ago\nAnd that the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously a much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact it will eventually end up in a collection the count\nI'm not able to pay the amounts and fall\nUm\nYeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife\nUm should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWow so you learn to you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on or Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can because you've got wonderful income you'll be dead for two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start to one thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go way really really fast you make a lotta money\nYou're going to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you are just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either at the surf through and lip service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death\nAnd it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nYou have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner needing to hire new team members don't waste your time searching job sites full of resumes that aren't right for the position you're hiring the smart thing to do is to go to zip ... have\nTo stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and hand it plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know of of her check because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy show on\nWhile he was doing drugs you know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of initially\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that beep perpetual\nBut to do that to like run yeah I'd be out but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again but you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy\nYeah and I'd like to get her up and running in healthy\nYou know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she's going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she only did he medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate well there's\nYou you don't want them just you know you know all the rest of their life\nAs I Know I mean they had control their she'd only ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as a semi mentally ill and she is she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nHer ... her only shopping as what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nIt happens to people all the time though what did she say right now when they call her a yacht so you get nothing so she does take up the phone you know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them 'cause you just you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking she should be telling them either one of\nThe I'm not going to long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the death right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two it they will eventually come back and won a negotiating\nI ain't going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah\nOkay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months\nHow their their during our pliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any ill so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nUntil let's say I mean she'll showing a little bit here Thirteen\nWell it'll here Thirteen entered their eight and get their hey look at and we were at a deal yeah or you know they\nWere Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm no backup and work and again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that the settlement in full will\nDo it and get an in writing and no electronic access to your checking account 'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry\nAnd so you got to treat them like rattlesnakes because they are [noise]\nPerson here\nWho's going into a rattlesnake then\nShe starts making some money you got to walk with or emotionally on this\nYou can you can give us a cheerleading support that she needs without giving them money\nAnd I think you're the rights to all of that\nThere's good news show she can make it out if she makes a good choices [noise]\n\nOkay things are getting ... where it out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal financial info up half\nOf all

or\nCrude production why ... is from Bloomberg Trump ... yeah same you better do it you want military stuff you'd better do it that were on the way for on a track here's your forecast\nAnd unusually persistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevations of the Rockies\nRain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains\nSevere thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers five Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nAnd friday they will move forward or to move with a cloture vote the enclosure for those that may not know is basically just ending the debate and discussion on it\nAnd and saying okay now it's ready for a vote so that vote would happen I'm assuming if and don't know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them\nYou know with what the headcount is for the vote and I I doubt they're going to want to delay a much longer after that cloture vote if they get fifty or more\nWe've got a Christian Battle Creek Michigan Chris welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show\nAre you good that [noise] ah well I'm curious about and it's just something that went through my head is what do you uh what do you guys think about the idea that\nThe whole reason they held everything and that they've been doing what they've been doing and they laid the groundwork for in the hearings\nBy a claiming that he gets kinda partisan and attacking them is that they didn't think they were actually gonna be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh\nSo what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and is on the Supreme Court from this point forward there on a plane he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or abstain from any votes\nMay be worth anything they want to but they they don't they can do\nHe's you know it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they they ... ... email us ... screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere can't get anywhere with it\nOK because I've heard lawyers you know try and\nNo show that judges short recused themselves Oh yes our well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way the Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases where we've even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right or right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I remember I\nCan't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they receive the down the it got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it or or there\nFor example they're arguing the case of deals with a ... you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the GOP getting at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because she's been partisan and he got angry at them and that's not going to hold any water\nYeah but you remember when they talk about ah you know is nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process uh the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like OK let's [laughter] she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and that and you know you you get the the the whole thing and\nAnd of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but\nThe the\nProcess and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that she does on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we don't agree with in fact the uh well I can think of free that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that but the procedure\nOn procedural issues all of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures\nAnd how you move forward with the case or it is not it is not driven like the social media world of today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedure now the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context or they did that with Scalia\nOr but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are see\nThat right now and you know but I I think you make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great great friends were great money to make that their their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges\nPrivately what they believe about the process of Kavanaugh is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because entertains\nDoor this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine\nControlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two cigarettes\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the claim came out what they would do is look at that and go okay was there anybody backing it up because the claim would be in the three oh two\nExcept if they found that they couldn't find any anyone who first hand knowledge of the event or the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well\nThey know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what\nWe're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about with all the federal judge to south or forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there\nThat background checks are done how many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody and\nNever get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this\nBut I'm doing this because the end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority\nThat is a more construction is well journalists core and then learning\nOf this this rule now it puts it on and the prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about it\nWhen it would have never it would have you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not would not have been able to cooperate and then at that point\nIt died just like probably the thousands of other allegation s ... you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nThe decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why\nIt makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically white work to her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to lead to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight six six Ninety
