the show\nWas joining us over\nTo five so troubling to five five to\n... is with us from Hartford, Connecticut ... how are you\nI'm good thank you so much for taking my call sure what's up I'm\nCalling because my husband and I just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball we have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loan and um we have fifty six hundred\nYou have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans and um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings and my question is um we have\nA baby coming and da da da da da da da da\nDa you know get the thousand dollar emergency fund any forty six hundred to pay off the shelves yet but now with the baby I didn't know that that I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push pause on the total money make over okay and pile up cash as big a pile as you can file between now and the time by becomes okay and um\nAnd then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital in everybody's fine in April\nThat event is then behind us in any worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right\nUm well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I have an eight eight years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then okay unit in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at a student loan you will of lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our this is actually our second child token you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and the ah the baby the boy 'cause I have a lot of girls close you know\n\nThis is a day for him she\nOpened pose a AAA eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you I'm good how are you a better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nOkay so my husband and I got to pay for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we park is our life insurance and we got part permanent part term and of course we watch the insurance part last night and we just got\nA block and turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and we immediately wanted to get rid of the term are alright the permanent and get have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about why permanent insurance not core folly of a permanent insurance which is what you do is it\nFailed bad shall we still didn't get the term I apparently he doesn't\nKnow much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] okay they Ramsey does not ever invest\nSounds real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances to use life insurance and investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nWhen you say because what we told him we wanted to do with\nLanguage so unique new financial advisor that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial adviser you have a life insurance salesman\nOkay the shelling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do it switched to four hundred thousand just the term ache and then that money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month but I'll do a lot um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed with mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class was er yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he just language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's are ignorant\nRight [laughter]\nHe's a family friend who's in the\nUm actually one of our friends who did apparently gave them our number ... than for as well\nYeah okay so I don't know which is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I never in my life told someone to buy\nOh which is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I have never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nNight and they're laughing it on our current policy um on your car he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever like on ... and our term policy when can we were eighty with hand\n[laughter]\nOkay why don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys over charge you for everything he sold you know car and you're probably gonna end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nHey that sounds like well Oregon ... I'm In the end of it right\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically\n[noise] um the people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay\nOnly the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is\nGone so you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep\nAll your money after that they give you about ready to return and when you die they keep it all\nSo bad savings account bad investment program the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what they Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is all I have owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever not did get\nA horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was\nAnd got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything other than\nFifteen to twenty year\nLife insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the shops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr their car insurance for homeowners insurance [noise]\nIf any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal or their car insurance your homeowner's insurance\nLong term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that show that while this always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name to a list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the usually endorse local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual yesterday coroner homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state formation\nForeign nation wide in Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide in it now\nBut um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that but you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for their new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plan you heard me or do you even have one\nIt gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occurred on them home with a mortgage\n\nShall we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want to do will be your friend knew the way but the way I live my life is how I answer questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability and up terms in downtime\n... enjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just ...

N. dot com you'll never more than Fifteen minutes away from today's top news stories Arizona is breaking news on traffic leader with Arizona's largest radio news team Katie a our news [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHi there good evening and welcome to the jumbo had a job in Westwood One radio where what eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six online find as a jumbo had a show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at Jim Botox\nWell Tuesday will be two weeks until the election we're getting very close to one of the more important midterm elections in recent memory and that we have a sort of take a look at it from a variety of angles and we thought we might take a look at it this evening\nFrom the standpoint of the largest uh rather fastest growing a voting bloc in the country one of the largest of such voting blocks the Latino vote and do so and the company of ... he is the founder and CEO of ... wealth management a good evening good to have you with us\nThanks for having me Jim honor to be here\nThank you very much a first of all it is a a large group or\nJust in terms of of sheer numbers are there are about I think twenty nine million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide they make up a twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and those are I Believe a new highs right\nYeah absolutely but the funny thing is that a lot of them are not floating\nWell that was another interesting and always a disappointing when you look at any segment of the population a and that is that the midterm vote was ... a rate for Latinos Asians and wide reach ... record lows in ... fourteen\nThe Latino voter turnout rate in the mid term elections has declined steadily since twenty oh six\nAnd a bed dropped in twenty four team to a record low twenty seven percent\nOf white and Asian eligible voters also a record low turnout rates are although there was a record number of Latino voting six point eight million in the twenty four teams will be because their numbers were growing but still as a percentage\nThat is a decidedly disappointing given some serious and contentious issues at stake why do you suppose that is\nWell you know it's funny ... I ... the Latino vote\nOn the back to the gym but I had a child late six six five oh jumbos we've been examining the Latino vote a big part of the American vote and one that cannot be simply a tossed aside as a a democratic votes something for Democrats to a\nA simply a take advantage of them to or something for Republicans to completely ignore or not the true at all now that let's just go to pose here this actual campaign as the president is trying to stand in the way of any pending blue wave\nWith just Eighteen days left until the mid term elections the president is the book solid for the final push holding for rallies and the next five days\nAnd as Pamela Brown reports will likely see more of a newly minted rallying cry at those rallies\nDemocrats ...\nRepublicans for jobs\nYou write me line of attack from President Trump as he tries to ... Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around too\nI knew rhyming line of attack from President Trump as he tries to pump up Republican voters by laying out a closing argument around two weeks from the mid term election [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of Kavanaugh law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nAnd remember it's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nFrom feeding on a new migrant caravan thousands of Central Americans nearing Mexico's southern border presumably headed to the U.S\nI Will say I have caused the problem because I have such an incredible economy I have so many [noise]\nEverybody\n[noise] with the war in the world we're doing a hell of a job\nUsing those laws sibling Democrats without evidence supporting the immigration and fly\nAs you know I'm willing to send the military to defend our southern border [noise]\nAll costs because the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge what changed the laws like\nTrump also taking a Twitter with his Democratic conspiracy theory I Am watching the Democrat Party lettuce south on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nThese leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people including many criminals from entering Mexico to the U.S again same without evidence this group of migrants are criminals\nDemocrats for their part accusing the president I fear mongering\nThey almost want there to be an immigration a challenge there almost cheering it on a because they're looking for some way to create or something to frighten the American people during an election\nWith control of the house and Senate and the balance Trump is in full campaign mode as the election season entered its final weeks\nCampbell Brown and with all due respect to uh Pamela of course he did not say they were all criminals you said that they include criminals just a little parsing the language that might help to further understand the discussion so we are talking to us with a key lay low ratio of the real wealth management\nAnd looking at or something I I Will simply state this as as I see it and I believe that this is accurate whether you did this is right or wrong and that is we live in a world of nation states\nNation states have the absolute right to determine\nOf their own prerogative who gets into their country how many for how long and for whatever reason now there are those of course who who uh get a warm and fuzzy feeling about the whole world holding hands and sing income by a I'm not one of those people\nAh I'm all in favor of immigrants who come to this country by the laws of the land but no one anywhere in this world has the right to enter another country without the country's permission\nOr do you uh take exception do any of that\n[noise] you know I I think that the immigration issue is a very complex and complicated issue I think that\nWe should be a better policy on immigration that I'm not that it's not strong enough that it should be definitely more career and um\nThat we should be trying also\nThis is our back yard we should be trying to help these countries are a lot of the problems I hate to say this but a lot of the problems these countries\nWere created by us I mean I miss Thirteen from LA they're not from those countries so you know it's kind of a double edged\nThing although he wasn't lying to US government policy that created in most Thirteen\nOf course not of course not\nOnly from LA uh they they they certainly are and of course ah many of them have gone back and forth and there are those who would wind up in other countries who who wind up a\nA entering this country but I guess the point is simply and I saw this sign by demonstrator out in California some months back and it it it's just stuck in my mind\nThe size of the red immigration is right\nAnd and at the time I remember saying no it is not a writer you may argue that you think it ought to be which would at least be a debatable point I Would argue that it is not\nAnd should not be quote a writer but a privilege to be conferred by a nation state or depending on what is the best interest of the nation state but to call it a right or simply indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and in my view that it should not be a ride per se\nThe indicates that you really don't know what's going on it isn't a ride a and it is my view that it should not be a ride per se but this whole discussion of course is not about immigration and never has been it is about the laws of the land that is to say who enters the country legally and who does not your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh [noise] I think things are changing you know just a by twenty fifty Hispanics or or you know actually I don't like the term Hispanics I like to turn back to you know it's more reflect upon us\nOr a by twenty ... you are we are a warning for one\nIn four ... persons here in the United states are going to be Hispanic whether we like to acknowledge that or not if we don't terror policies that address this coming wave because\nWe're seeing families grow here average average Latino families have a lot more\nUh sons and daughters ah than an average angle a family um but more importantly we used to tailor policies that makes sense that are not cruel and that makes sense going forward for the future that's just an anger\nOr ended and obviously we are are dealing in pigeons will get a few from our audience as well here and they just a few minutes\nAh for example let's take of the case of the uh the children separated from their parents at the border or is my understanding that if we were to come across a parents who were let's say a robbing a bank\nOr that we would probably wind up separating those parents from their children\nAnd my response of frankly to those people is perhaps some would say harsh but this is my view if you don't want to be separated from your children stop breaking into our country there are procedures for entering this country and yes sometimes they are a very a link the and sometimes they are\nLaden with red tape but uh so be it a that does not give you the right to turn this into the international flop house your thoughts\n[noise] you know uh for many years uh back in the early Nineteen hundreds there was no illegal immigration John and I agree with you I think that I I I agree with you to a point but\nYou know looking at it from the other side of the of the class you have to also say to yourself Seventeen to Twenty years for someone to become a citizen of this country because I've seen that\nYes and I had it I did a whole show on that and and uh ... ... is not exaggerating that that that is the length of time it takes some people and it's way too long we proceed\nYou know so you know in that sense if we could you know if we can get both sides of the aisles to start having the dialogue started having this conversation no one's ever going to be a hundred percent happy\nBut we sure are going to work and show progress to putting together an immigration that makes sense for every\nNow and again the prospect of this country being a one quarter or one third or more a Latino or bothers me not one wet and I suspect most Americans as well provided they came here legally which of course in the case of many would not be the case\nBut this is not about ethnicity or anything other than the laws of the land and ah so anyway the ah the point of course obviously then we'll discuss this in the the next half hour of the program with our guest is is we're talking about the Latino vote and the midterm elections to what extent\nIs this an issue of for the Latino population are obviously it is at issue is an issue for all of us but there are other issues as well a job's a crime of all the other issues that affect everyone how does this fit into the ... of opinion here will be back in just a moment\nYou're never more than Fifteen minutes away from today's top news stories Arizona is breaking news and traffic leader with Arizona's largest radio

what's island in like a club or a hundred years ago\nOr four thousand migrants coming to the southern border now twenty eight so what will be the er at different ... especially legally\nOkay well I can certainly give you my answer to that of my answer would be that the the ones who showed up at Ellis Island went through a process\nAnd they weren't just a landing by boat somewhere along the east coast and running a show or they were going through the process which is all the difference in the world as far as I'm concerned a of a ...\nA year and I both know that that process was short or months at best also\nIt was not illegal to enter the country at that time right or they did not have\nThe laws that we have now set up your right or wrong and it was a kid for process entire gym\nThat's true but nonetheless it is the right of the country to do so I Would even go further and say once you're a population reaches a certain critical mass it as the obligation of the nation state to determine who gets it when you reached the point where there are a\nA certain number beyond a certain number of people that are easily absorbed\nThat uh it has the obligation of the country

right\nNow I have no reason to believe it's anything other than candidates a complicated issue and I I assume that what you here's what he thinks so go ahead\nOr the other thing is this is the the

like to add to their progressive crown and I have to say\nThat I Am very concerned about the race when governor and senator in Florida and the rates the senator in Texas and I really haven't heard very much about it but um I get the feeling that it's not going to well in Florida I don't know about Texas but\nI don't know if you have any insight to what's going on there I Know that I'm\nA several hundred thousand people have migrated from Puerto Rico to Florida after that terrible hurricane last year and a the Democrats were in a very big hurry to get them registered to vote because\nThey can vote or in in Florida I don't know what insight you have you heard about those two states and I had relatives who live in Florida\nAnd I really can't have with them because they're they just do not want to talk about politics\nYeah and that's another topic I uh have down for tonight I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on

he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like it was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race I think the senatorial race is is also wifi so that'll depend on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrats' side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you look at the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race is one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and you got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer\nHealth care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them\nBeing down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats in this and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying tonight is it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about an hour from the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of left us than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know\nThat I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's of American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh\nI think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing and saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside they treated him some badly they must\nBut you know what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving aside they treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the way even announced that he did want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think ... uh eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or ... wrote\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lakes region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit's you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and facts Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas we're going to get about another inch of rain today\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing if I Lived in say in Asia and I kept my kid to have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course they could go wrong with the babies laying I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah Wright speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah getting runners mark\nYes sir hey I'm\nYou're on the market you know well\nGreat I'm well I'm I recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant um well\nI wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then she ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to green card\nNow the way they have you ever heard of the way they act and I'm just not just touching up from what the previous the previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here illegally\nHave a have a you know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off of the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever know I I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then\nThey want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt it's an amazing thing I'll I'll go in my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience um I met her to live with it you know with a lawyer feed\nEverything that I guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way they act as the women against violence um act um\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card\nAnd ... and you know um I I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a Georgian Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nWarner mark\nI keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't suit\nBut I think it's also a misnomer we do not have illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going on these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of these other ...\nNo you're right\nAnd we're being invaded by the failures of these other action\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nIf it was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of having agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America in the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they and they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issues not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly\nLet's go to somebody could calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably missed that ups than Iran with mark\nOh thank you mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey in who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped enemy territory for a while hopefully we can get ... out of their\nUh God but uh I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and um\nYou know how to stop that and if you remember like during the ah was when we were setting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war as they were taking a people who are voting and dying their ... their thumb purple\nYou know you couldn't vote more than once\nAnd I would say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nWell you you you know the whole controversy over voter id and the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's the big crime to ask someone do you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know the oh we're being races were made this you know how could you do that yeah I by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think also a about a year of the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes into vote and you know you have to\nSign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting or I don't they just take your picture and start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace\nTo you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera you feed it into facial recognition say in a in a tri-state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state on the same day and you know when you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting a voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their dress\nAnd you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know or you go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them and uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered and more than one place\nWell there are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... I think he was off off of that I Know that do but there's another point that you didn't think of\nI don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures or they can't even find my name is the Pennsylvania\nI don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOr they can't even find my name but Pennsylvania or you know I'm originally you know I'm right right so you're going to people who are you oh Martha that you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever walking the vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have stand you have a celebrity ideas but they're not going to work have agreed evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have a winning the vote one time it was a primary and uh they had a I asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nRight and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in doubt I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd it was like you know I'm totally amazed they said well you know what's going on and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you\nKnow you're a you want to vote Republican he goes uh or or Democrat I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could and he says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight you know I thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't run the Republican it why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six Ninety seven thirty three thirty nine Marcus there for red irate\nWanting to go for your goals eight six six Ninety read read on the radio [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "20"}
