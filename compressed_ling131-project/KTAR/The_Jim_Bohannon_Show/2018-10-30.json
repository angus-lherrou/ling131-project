federalist dot com if you want to look up the article the article says the research proves the number one social justice imperative is\nMarriage I don't have\nTime to go through the whole article but this is just really intriguing research just just Seventy years ago social mobility and protection from poverty\nWere largely a factor of employment those who had full time work of any kind were sold them for fifty years ago education marked the Gulf separating the haves and the have nots\nFor the last Twenty years or more though marital status has increasingly become the central factor in whether our neighbors and their children rise above remain or descend into poverty the research is astounding\nIn Nineteen sixty the poorly and moderately educated we're only ten percent less likely to be married then the college educated with both numbers quite high eighty four Ninety four percent respectively\nThat parity largely held until the late Nineteen seventies or either the sexual revolution

Dave how are you doing better than others or what's up in your world [noise]\nWell I'm I'm preparing for separation\nAnd I'm I'm not quite sure what to do with my dad a specific lane lie a student loan debt\nOkay a separate from your husband John Harris\nYeah sorry about yes my husband\nOkay and um\nShow or you're preparing for separation how long have you been married\nOh about twenty two years\nOh my goodness it must be ...\nIt it just that we are a chip not on the same\nPage anymore um and ah what other things but ah with money as well and it's just a it's just a thing I just I just don't want to go on with\nMhm have you been seeing emerge ... uh that that he's not willing to do have you gone yeah OK\nPlease do that for you even if he won't go oh\nOkay I think it will give you good\nI'm emotional information twenty two years in a long time and you need to have somebody walk with you who's not in the fog if you go through this and or give you some in maybe maybe give you some information to give him a little bit of a wake up call as well but back to your original question\nI have a friend of mine the teacher's divorce recovery recovery after a divorce and um I remember many years ago hearing her say divorced turns on marriage into a business transaction\nAnd the show it it comes it's a real quickly the emotions are carved often shut over to one side and the actual technical legal financial details are on the other side\nAnd it becomes very transactional kind of thing at that point does that make sense yes\nAnd so a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans that are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not\nYes and so a here here's a couple of things to look at your student loans or your student loans that are going to go with you unless you know you may or may not get alimony child support or something else but\nYour student loans are going to go with you [noise] um and you're going to have to pay them so what is your personal income\nAt it they took out\nOkay All right and so what you start doing is if this is a a direction that you you know after seeing a counselor and doing everything he can to save a twenty two year investment uh in with all the help you can get a you start preparing for living on your own for fifty thousand bucks a year\nAnd you'd you'd look at your student loans so much to learn that if you got\nA better Kim I'm Sorry it out and oh my lord okay [noise]\nWell how would let them know that this was going on hardship to furrow until you get past ah what else whatever else is going on here okay now do you own a home\nYeah what's it worth to hydrate out what soda on it or a hundred Seventy thousand\nOkay so no equity either the amount to anything or is your car paid for yeah as his car by for now okay is your name on that loan yeah good okay are there any credit cards that have both of your names on them\nAnd they're at the one that I have to let him ... I'm Sorry\nYou refuse to let him you add it all better than that close that account today\nJust completely closed the credit card if he has the number he can use it if he's one of the users on the car [laughter] period and if things go sideways emotionally inside your house I have run into situations in Thirty years of doing this where somebody takes in Mexico drip and puts it on the guard\nAnd you don't want to pay for five thousand dollar cruise for somebody else you know and it'll end up on this card so close the account today just completely shut it down to zero balance yeah good close it okay ... does your checking account have both names on it\nYeah okay sure your money separated by march is there any other debt or dead instrument that's open that as both of your names on it\nYeah yeah\nOkay I don't accept her mortgage probably as both are names on okay so here's what happens you can't afford to keep this house you can't stay there yeah um so the house needs to either be refinanced to get your name off of the mortgage or sold\nYou cannot stay on the mortgage and give him the house that would be dumb\nAnd people often do that in a divorce they often do that but just\nYou know the negotiation is the cars in his name he keeps his car your cars and your name you keep your car you're checking accounts are already separated there's no other debt you get your student loan debt I'm ... does he have any big savings or investments or to you and for one case\n[noise] I'm not big now how much am I have I have a ten\nThousand mhm four one K. and I'm not sure what he had um but I'm thinking about five or six thousand not much at all okay as far as well\nAs his income\n[noise] ah it's around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and are going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you got a message on your hands [laughter]\nOkay no I'm not\nSo um unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans are going to get the cheapest department you can get you going to stay debt free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize the\nAfter the separation which will lead to a divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that puts you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially I'm ... and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I just put 'em all harshly heroin and pain\nReady to pay them pile up money for deposits and for paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nBut let's get the other side has but but my hope is is that you guys you can see accounts for who can give you some words to say some tools\nTo get by by wakeup call maybe the two of you sit down with a coach or counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back and may be you can save this thing I ... that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concerns are addressed and I'm sure that I'm sort of like a pretty long list but I'm just I don't address ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can I sit down with can walk me through\nUm\nThe right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him because he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor\nThat's really experienced in wise and\nA godly council a will help you in that situation and I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you it'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else\nSo good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five you

everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nOne way and I mean sweet but dumb well you know right yeah I think so but I think the thing is here yeah I'm\nProbably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and ... back and a little bit better you know in the two y'all decide are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on one of the keep the ring or not so young and so this ring is not gonna make or break you get out of debt plan one way or the other but this behavior will\nAnd this lack of being on the same page will so\nYou know what let's just talk this through and and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together what to do with the ringing I don't know I I it just represents dumb and so I'm not ever going to really be able to enjoy it\nIf I'm you are because it's just in violation of where are you thought your whole family was heading and it's

think we are we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching a my father died\nIt was about three years ago um started doing your bank way a way ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching a my father died about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um there were a bunch of why we try and all that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ... and then\nUm and the question that I have and\nHe put her in any New Jersey about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars and the annuity um and and the other end up like ... and ... and they've been growing a little bit here and there\nUm but the question of the annuity recently we had a five year mark and advising her to all the money I turned ... which I think is a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should have had that money in fact it initially at the beginning of the uh time you know and put up pretty putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but he doesn't need the the drawing the humidity at all you know and he knew that the beginning of the time\nWell yeah you're right that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you I'm but I I Am I and I am I personally would have put all of it and the good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nThe top one hundred percent car the head off she has the wrote that\nHe wrote good good\nOkay and how much is investments total does three hundred plus I'm\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand a notice\nHow another fifty to sixty onto the honor their\nLips she\nAh she thinks she just turned sixty okay All right cool when she's in great out oh she's not like an old you're always on our way out right out\nGood I'm feeling better fifty seven they're usually that so um [laughter] uh I'm not on my way out that I either a\nAnyway or at least a dumb out to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um\nIt's not it's not like you put her in Hawaii policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean it just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity and the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nAre there okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that I like question his entire competency I just really want to know if it wasn't right for her ... if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd I'm like you've got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he goes up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when

destroy\nHis campaign when they couldn't do it they try to destroy the legitimacy of a presidential election in twenty sixteen they also took that information\nIt destroyed the legitimacy of a presidential election in twenty sixteen\nThey also took that information and used it to get a secret warned against the opposition parties campaign you want corrupt possible corruption that's corruption\nYeah as absolute that's how how do you debate something like that I ... debate those facts when it's documented for video roadblock here's your forecast\nMultiple periods of rain and high elevation snow will impact the Pacific northwest in Northern Rockies which could cause accumulating snow for many Portland set to receive a few inches overnight snow in Denver low thirty to\nSalt Lake City Utah could see some frozen precept going into Wednesday morning then ran through the end of the week there no for the northern New Mexico mountains dry conditions will persist across much of California and the great basin elevated fire concerns mainly along VCR up front\nOr by the way they don't believe they're wrong for doing it you know\nShe she made this comparison to ISIS and made this absurd statement because she believes she's right not because she's trying to get attention not because of anything else she believes it was the right thing to say and that\nPeople agree with her on it that it's responsible to say that she believes in fact it's her responsibility to point out what is clearly blatantly false achieve things it's right\nOr looking here at some of the polling from Rasmussen which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump for his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs\nThat's good news though for Republicans facing election with voters said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash but some reports\nNational television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still write his performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positives continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic uh a performance\nGood or excellent marks for months ago when it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June forty four percent consider his performance poor but\nThe cab yet here just six percent right national security as our top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's a point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're long as we're not in a war you know new a new war people don't care right or the NBC or a survey this is what does this year the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties of for most days in recent months speaking at a high a fifty one percent\nTwo weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the presidency on the Rasmussen poll predictably eighty eight percent of Republicans think Trump is doing a good or excellent job handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the GOP voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job among voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy while black unemployment is at a historic low blacks were much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending an update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw a Rasmussen uh that uh he released just a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating and here\nDominic things because I saw a Rasmussen uh that uh he released just a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating and here's what he writes Trump approvals today back at fifty percent black voter approval at record high\nWell so we're talking about the economic and inform but overall they say Trump's black approval right now I'm at a record\nHigh yeah well and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question as it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right but\nBut but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about I mean in part on the positive side as the last caller pointed out\nYou know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy but but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before Kavanaugh\nThere were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but they're still never truckers there's still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nI ... a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of them right so there's that that part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK\nThe game has changed\nNow it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terror of no terrorists by the way we're the original tariffs babies\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debate on very real issues\nWith no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be protecting the constitution because the process is being ... it was it was all but shredded\nIn terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh or they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've never seen it\nIn a one thing I just want to bring up here because we're talking about the different to you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or whatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you've heard that the Dallas Morning news indoors a better or ... and they claim you know you hear the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news or conservative Dallas Morning news with the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative and support paid or work number Ted Cruz no no you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media there seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative no you're not she's not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the ... you could talk ... former conservative columnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other\nYeah it's like wait a minute\n[laughter] yeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels and he posted a picture of\nA him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter and we're just like it was most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other you know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol mhm ah who just has lost it you see John Case it\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nOr I'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes mhm you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald or I don't like Donald Trump but I don't like the fact that Cruz now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it to say you're voting for ... because\nBecause the ... the Ted Cruz in conservativism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you can possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all you're not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show\nWhy because as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show and we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve mhm Supreme Court\n\nYou know if Trump was done if Trump was done today I'd be happy\nI was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the work's not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot and I said but but imagine even the tax cuts didn't get done\nI'd

even that the economy ... weren't growing as as fast\nA ... and the guys were happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't it's not the we never cheer the endgame you and I are the

O. in [noise] and ah dot com of course to ah Alex in Hampton bays New York ... good evening Alex welcome\nHey Jerry oh fine thank you\nGood I'm I'm just calling it's just crazy how the less spins everything\nTo being Donald Trump's fault I mean ... you got I got I understand that you have not jobs on either side so you have the job that was supposedly at Trump's order that thank you know those bombs and everything like that but then you have a\nSpecific are shooting which is a terrible tragedy but how do you blame him for that well\nI mean he he is on record the shooter in Pittsburgh it's believed that Donald Trump as they try to live in the news\nAnd he's anti Donald Trump either their leader that's true I I just don't understand how that happens and I think the more that that do the liberal media pushes that that the more that the right\nRises up and it's getting out get out there and vote because that's really the only way you can dispute this [noise] and I like it out there and vote\nThat I certainly am all in favor of everyone the getting up there in the in voting and uh let's bring this to our guest\nI've I Believe the as the caller that there is a great deal of blame placed on the president when in doubt blame the president on the other hand\nA President Trump I think at times is his own worst enemy he makes enemies he doesn't need to make and there's sometimes more interested in getting and applause line from his base is in the thinking about the the way he says things he creates problems for himself in in my view a doctor banks can\nBuy you know I think that can be said object cannot everybody hit that research and political off it but he clearly you know we got our eyes on him [noise] but we have to cut your way Sinclair exam\nThere can critical off it but he clearly you know we've got our eyes on him but we had to situation here jam one where we had an avid avid Trump supporter and then on the heels of that\nThat we've got a situation where someone who despise us chaff so it's not reasonable to blame this on the president's we had issues like this before Trump as president ... hot\nAnd we will we will that is the state of the world that we live in right now unfortunately though to blame that on someone who is in political office that's just kind of a cop out in my opinion\nI Would agree with you completely and it's really unfair to blame these incidents on the president\nBut it I think is fair to say that the president sets themselves up as an easy target for criticism sometimes maybe not maybe not fair criticism but as an easy target\nA and he could avoid some of that if you would would simply go about about doing so let me ask you a doctor bench than about the state\nOf a mental health care and facilities in this country right now I Would assume that you would be among those who say we need more\nOf everything a clinics money a therapist what have you\n[noise] oh ... absolutely right Jim you know it it's not good\nFor sure but then there's plenty of room for improvement you know as a mental health provider in the field for Thirty years I've taken a pay cut every year because the rates of Medicare go down and the insurance goes with it and then we're ... we're asked to see more patients in a shorter amount of time in the in a certain amount of time to make an\nAccurate diagnosis that an accurate treatment plant and when individuals can't find help\nThen they just go further and further into that ditch and in many of these situations worse team that there is a history of at least symptom even if not diagnosable mental health conditions but what we're seeing in America is that the American Psychological Association has found that\nFifty nine percent of Americans consider us to be at the lowest point in the United states history and that's causing them stress\nAnd although it might help if they if they said something about American history well it literally the sixties only you only have to go back fifty years to find a comparable period and have you back a hundred and fifty years the ... the civil war and leading up to it it vastly exceeded today so again we have\nNo rational basis for that guy the script worse than American history only says one thing that you don't know much about American history of you believe that\nI Would agree with your jam button that they're in lies the problem the problem is that we're dealing with people's perception\nAnd their perception is their reality so whether we're talking about a gunman or where talking about you know I'm not they're concerned about the price of diapers it's obviously a facetious example but it goes to the fact that\nWe're dealing with people's perception and then how they manage that perception and we have some who have a stronger moral compass", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "30"}
