Do not know why they think it could be a lot of money that make 'em so if you\nUm how much we can get fat I fate unlike ought to take a pay check 'em you can read about in LA the cat that I Want to say that I Am fortunate to have parents kind of that to let you have like free\nThat's very uh ... what do you make um monthly about eleven hundred and is that and that's after graduating say okay

while I'm On the side of my education will take the call so I say about like a year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that's you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh\nOut on your own okay you're not making enough to do that show we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need to double your income off\nPretty quick here as fast as you can and when you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no debt do you have any debt at all\n[noise] um we had about twelve hundred at ... and I taught babbling about it a day I'm ... I'm I count it up to 'em that they're taking care of that\nIf I can stop leash more credit\nWhere do you mean they're taking care of that\nSo they they came to a lady and they offered to pay a whole lot allowing off to Africa\nOr that you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any debt you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so where you are one hundred percent that free\nMe and then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expense for the show like five thousand dollars of shows up for emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also\nIn your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay good\nWell you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know when you were Thirteen thousand and when you get your twenty six thousand quicken ... doubling that's still not a lot of money but they'll at least get you out there and get your moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us from prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\nAn idea thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I got my boys are kids and we just moved into our dream on three years ago or ten twelve acres to walk through with the kids turn around but the last few months ago just started you're planning on them are in baby steps you know\nAnd torture thinking um when we got thirty five thousand undead besides the house and we're just not sure if we want and we need to sell the house just to be free or which is ... through the next ten Fifteen Years and just make it out in\nTen to Fifteen Years remain payroll house and everything\nYeah like whoa where you know we have twenty eight years left my mortgage\nMm So what's your house and\nIt's about Seventy K take home pay\nAll right yeah and um then what is your house payment\n[noise] it is around twelve hundred a month\nOkay how's payments not on the line here that's fine no on but you gotta lotta ... you've got a lot of kids and you're not used to living on a limited budget and you're going to start that\nWere egg yeah because you've got thirty thirty five an hour to clean up I mean you really need to clean that up it's probably going to take you year and a half two years but something like that you know longer than two years you need to have this debt cleaned up\nRight what is the thirty five thousand in debt what kind of bet\nA lot or the lock my parents and part of it is my credits twenty five on a credit and ... and learn from our parents\nOkay she'll just a line of credit what'd you bond with a line of credit\nOh it's just been life has just been there about a piano a few years ago I just missed pointed wearing\n... and that's over right yeah not doing that anymore right\nNo no no we were like we are just sick and tired we just want to be free you know we love the place\nI don't think they need I don't think you need to sell the house houses knocking on your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home pay is not at all on your oh you're okay on her house but you do\nHave to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can ever dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five 'cause if you concluded the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids\nAnd you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable\nYou can do that as a lay down and you can do that a thirty five thousand out Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in the two and the term landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nI have a great got how can I help [noise] so I Would call and bring about emerging\nPick on we have a fully funded an emergency I knew it out of the three to six months [noise] good how about the camp out and then now I'm at my job for a trip they account on they match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should\nShould I fully fund the account and should account that towards the handler\nEmergency Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful and the ... of course you can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nNo single and I'm\nOkay and what's your household income\nOf around sixty and what do you do er nurse\nYour nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one and twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back at all you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that\nGiven that you've got that type of a career that's not so specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you'll often or something like your six minutes um\nThen given that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at it you find that I just say\nBetween the three to six months of expenses range I Would back down to about three months\nAgo and so that's kind of like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not we're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life\nWhen you can get you again you could lose your job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car they all kinds of things\nCan happen that aren't medical and you can't use the H aside for anything but medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact he got a big fat ... with a big fat match on your show wonderful both of them then that makes me very comfortable being on the three months side of the three to six months [noise]\nRain for your emerging [noise]\nQuestion I get asked all the time\nSo I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance was to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse or you have\nKids yes unique term life insurance that's the only way to protect them until you're out of debt and build up your wealth you're only digging a deeper hole if your waste money on cash value plans\nFor congratulated she amazing show who are your biggest cheerleaders each other\nYeah we were absolutely we were in in in in your guys as ministry that hands down\nOff some very cool well we're glad we're part of it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely incredible what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nI'd say there's a few things obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles in trials in life that if you guys I'm working together if there were days when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing probably Ninety nine percent of people in the world and I think you just kind of have to wear your shoulders and say hey this is what I Want and it wasn't fun you know she was she was working three literally three jobs she had three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go and cause I have a lot of time off with my job and I\nI didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in and out of University in and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more and just get it done and it's you know I I mean what did you make at that game for my average income is probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five I'm not much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I got the only lease it I think you would approve of\nThis is Dave Ramsey lease um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was gonna buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do with and I said hey I'll give you a thousand dollars if you let me drive the Pontiac for the next year and\nIt's an old beat up Pontiac and I'm driving two miles to work and said yeah don't shop salute Lee so\nUm you know at least at least ... at least it from him for a year [laughter]\nSo ... what was the best paying part time job you have\nProbably with what I Do now and I worked for a different school districts and

S. specializes in making just we\nWere going to get huge amounts of weight\nColumbia says okay will specialize in just making coffee we get huge amounts of coffee then we'll trade our coffee for you and we both countries end up with more coffee and more wheat without adding any more resources\nSo free trade benefits everybody well why is somebody complaining you would say and the answer is if we stop making coffee in my example and make just wheat anybody making coffee is out of a job you say well you can go make we\nBut the skills may not be transferable from the industries that leave to the industries that are built up and that's what happened in in Canada the U.S has an ... is very efficient at making dairy products\nTo to get free trade you should let us make the dairy products and sell them in Canada we'd end up both countries would end up with more a production of dairy products but the problem is\nWhat happens the Canadian dairy farmers well they should go do something else but they say we don't want to do something else do we want to continue to make dairy products for and that's what the rub is with with Canada\nAll right to a call from Sharon in ... Missouri a good evening Sharon\nGood evening can and about ... ... to to think I heard today only what on radio is that China has announced that they are going to be paying carrots\nOn hunting specified items and it sounds like there's going to be quite a few items that they are terrified and second\nDave bad trade agreements that we had had\nThis I'm Sorry I I just I'm too jaded anymore I Do not believe it added some ... steak\nNotion of what we've got to help everybody else there is one law that goes about all of their lives when it comes to politics and power and that followed them money and if you follow it influence\nThat is put on our politicians\nBy that lobbyist by different governments by our own government if you follow that money you will find exactly why we have had bad trade agreements ratified\nWell we're coming up on a break your all lifted Dodger give is the link here I'm sure in more learned opinion after the break a share and I will add a couple of things here\nUh to what you just said and please stay on the line\nOr one would be of course that are no matter how much lobbying occurs on behalf of foreign governments of goodness knows there's a ton of that\nOutright passage of money to a political candidates for public office from foreign sources is very much a no no and the second thing is I think you are vastly underestimate him the extent to which so many elites in this country ... oh so so guilty about how rich we are\nI'm Jim ... and we'll be back in just a moment\nI could just a moment Arizona is news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F.

cost\nThan it cost ... then for us to make ourselves then instead of these planes costing whenever they cost a few million dollars a piece you can reduce the cost to make the planes we don't need to give China our technology we don't need to let them make the finished product but if they can make components\nCheaper than we can make them ourselves are we better off taking it from them um and that allows us to produce it cheaper and that will be better off for us is\nWhich raises another point and I only have ... or something I'm going to bring up when we come back from the break but the point

eight six six five oh five or six to six were talking to Dr Michael butler from Stockton University a professor of finance there and also a public policy analyst and we're looking at the new proposed a trade deal again it's not a done deal yet has to get congressional approval\nBut it I suppose it is not a stretch to assume that even a badly divided Congress would\nBe able to say yes to a fair amount of what is in this let's talk to David new calls in from San Francisco tonight to David good evening\n[laughter] yes I jumped up and your guest I I'm Out here in San Francisco we've got two major a financial problems directly tied to this Chinese steel\nAnd uh one is the bay bridge which got opened a just a fabulously shore to five years ago and it was\nThis was the new post earthquake Bay Bridge right right yeah and in\nFact if you remember just a dollar value or at at in the Nineteen eighty nine earthquake they said it would be a quarter of a billion dollars to fix the bridge\nWhen the new bridge opened a couple of years ago it was a what six billion dollars in costs and six billion and financing so it went well forty eight times to become a twelve billion dollar broken rich and I was defective when it when it opened\nNow are you saying that that was built with with Chinese\nSteel oh yeah and what was said okay well I didn't know that yeah and what was\nSignificant about it Arnold was the governor\nAnd this cross wards in the right okay yeah ... was the Republican governor and little brown was the former mayor\nThe two of them put it together and they created they actually created a foundry in China to manufacture the ... the bridge apart there were very few repeating part so it was almost entirely custom\nAnd the they had something like twenty thousand inspectors per part or you know each park had to have an inspector massive art ... almost\nTo the to the mayor and they refused to accept delivery on the part yet it was over written by a a project manager who had no right to override\nWell that that sounded like a terrible deal I must say although I'm not sure quite how it fits into the the context of this discussion regarding a trade matters other than the fact that I I guess a professor bus or you should always look twice when dealing with the Chinese but a\nA Kurd in Rochester, Minnesota is the next step below Kurt\nHigh yellow the thing that bothers me about the uh the steel from China is if you drive a car\nA lot and you have to have your brakes re done you may have found out over the last Twenty years but you can't turn a rotor\nAnymore because the Chinese steel that all the car owners are made out of it is so poor that it is not turn of all\nYou know years ago you used to be able to take a break rotors or your drums in and you could Milam down and get another life out of them\nBut nowadays everybody has to throw away their owners because the ... the Chinese steel may be cheaper but the quality is also cheaper\nAll right I Want our guest to comment about there'll be led to calls regarding the quality of uh dealing with the Chinese\nIf it's that bad at least in regard to steal I mean the you know when you when you buy a a broom at Walmart you're really not looking for the the\nThe the nicest brew him out there you want some of them will sweep the floor or something like this is well I mean uh in the case of the break drums a that's not such a good thing in the case of bridges that's a terrible thing maybe it will die\nAre is that the other problem in trading with the Chinese the question of quality if you do we had a question some time back about\n... I forget who was food or pharmaceuticals but there was some serious question about Chinese quality\nYeah that's that's always an issue on a product like steel obviously quality is are essential there especially you're going into products\nOr like a bridge or something that could cause some severe a injuries but how about some of the uh smaller consumer product look at the textile industry\nSo if I'm a California used to have a huge textile industry and workers were making let's say twenty dollars an hour and as a result of that they made a real nice shirt that sold for fifty dollars\nWell they decided to outsource to make the ... the uh shirts in China where people are at the time or pay them\nAt the time or paid about a dollar a day so now they can make the shirt a and sell it instead of for fifty dollars they can sell the shirt now for twenty dollars so well that some people would say that's a very positive thing\nUh it's negative in that people will lose jobs here but it's positive in that all consumers now can purchase much more of goods and services because the prices are are lower\nExcept of course those workers were out of work who can't afford anything at all I mean the notion that we should we should we should build our economy strictly around consumers uh but that strikes me as a little short sighted and in fact it may be one of the principal reasons for what happened in the ... presidential election\nNext seminars or on Tuesday October second to the embassy suite stimpy and Wednesday October third at the courtyard Scottsdale\nYou said if somebody wanted to make you an as this cash off on your house within twenty four hours this is Doug copies real big executives of Doug ... dot com I'll buy your house for cash with no fees\nNor pairs no banks and no hassles any price at a condition any size closed as little as three days I don't care if it's a total fix Robert were perfect conditions just go to Doug ... for your free cash offer and make sure to check out the\nFlipping roasting radio show at its new time Saturdays at noon right here I get your news Ninety two or three of\nThem [noise] a A R I found when dealing with these Arizona's new baby a bad [noise]\n\nIn Las Vegas [noise]\nBagpipe replace the names of the ... people killed read aloud to Las Vegas mark one year's semester carried on by Steven had\nEarlier Monday President Trump extended his condolences\nAll of America is grieving for the lives lost and for the families they left behind so to all of those families and to the people of Las Vegas we love you we are with you\nIndonesia's disaster agency revise the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami that hit the central ... to twelve hundred thirty four up from over eight hundred previously\nOr here's the friday deadline FBI agents interviewed at least for individuals in connection with decades old allegations of sexual improprieties against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is alcohol consumption in high school and college couldn't couldn't come under scrutiny in a statement\nTo the New York times when of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates said what he told Congress was not true that in college he was a heavy drinker and when he got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive but tonight when of judge Kavanaugh's college suite mates\nPaints a different picture in a statement released by the White House then Murphy saying I never saw ... blackout nor did I ever see Brett act aggressive hostile or in a sexually aggressive manner to women\nABC's peer Thomas there's been a big change in a big company\nEconomists once said as GE he goes so goes the down well General Electric is no longer part of the composite having been replaced earlier this year and now the company's chairman and CEO is history to John Fleming has been ousted after less than two years on the job being replaced immediately like H.

what radio\nAll across America eight six six Ninety red eye he is our economy and I'm Gary McNamara or just a moment you want to talk about the the the president and the the agreement on the new trade deals a yesterday this was the president's talking about it yesterday or the way without tariffs we\nWouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about tariffs that includes Congress oh please don't charge tariffs without tariffs you wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here\nAre just want to spend a couple of moments on this we know people want to talk about the Kavanaugh thing but the this really a huge deal that I and I do think that\nUh this is something that the president politically can use a ... to help in the midterms when he's out there doing the rallies you know the the the we got the trade agreement and everything else\nNow the specifics of the the the trade agreement some good some bad mhm uh now the good is we don't go to a situation where we don't have any trade deal with Canada and Mexico that\nWould be bad if the president decided to go in that in that direction I still don't think we won't know and it's very tough to predict what's going to happen\nUh but I don't think the president would have ever gone that direction to begin with because there would have been pushback from the Congress yeah in fact when I think that President meant to say and that audio we just heard was the threat of tariffs because he knows that terrorists aren't good he's admitted it yes\nUh but the the the when you look at this the free trade agreement and I've got an email today from a guy saying you guys will be only to conservatives but think this deal stinks well number one we haven't really give our opinion on the deal and as we said last night\nThere are some parts of it we don't like it all including the major portion that the president has promoted but there's some good things in there are now we did open up some agriculture and dairy\nNow we heard about the dairy that was one of the big things the president promoted but his Wall Street journal points out we will only expand our market by one percent when it comes to dairy in Canada but still it's movement in the right direction and if you're making that more free trade world for that\nBefore that and that's a good thing\nOr one of the reasons we didn't hear about timber is because that's one of the victories of Canada got what Canada got was the president remember what the tariffs on soft timber or in April I Believe it was\nWell that's going to be retracted and the president just can't do it again under the new free trade agreement that has to go to a basically an arbitration panel a panel would have to decide whether ... was justified\nThe president used the term and talked about the babies when it comes to ... be known as the turf babies which I\nThen not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with trying to need to get in line and

self\nDeprecating humor from Donald Trump yeah\nYou know the last time that I've given came close to that was and no one saw it because it was in the middle of the night in the U.S\nI said two things about uh you know the president and and the timing of things so when he was at the the summit in Singapore mhm after they did the the photo up with Kim Jong il and he had his own press conference\nAnd he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think that the other thing that America Mr course was his his\nWind in his victory speech that night of the election and and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking\nAnd of course it wasn't a lot of that wasn't replayed by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at you know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet being settled in after the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because these the people who are being appointed\nIf they accept that you know ah if they're that nomination then they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cap it in place and the staff in place that he really wants in his second\nYear I think case could be made\nBy recent activity or lack of activity\nThat may be the president and there's also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms could be either or but I I I Do believe that the president has always been\nIn the private sector comfortable in his own shoes that changed when he went from having zero bosses to having\nMore than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place or for a number of reasons during the campaign in after the campaign\nAs he became president and I think there's a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and it has now knows what he can do and what he can't do\nI think there's probably a little more thought\nBased on recent behavior going into communication and how you interact with media\nBecause here's the thing he's winning\nOn the cabinet nomination they wanted an FBI background check he gave it to them then expanded the whole thing on Monday he's winning when you look at the things that that he's put out there aside\nFrom some gas communication wise president is winning the leftist screaming because not because they think that they're winning they know he's winning they know he's resonating\nIn the media especially that's why they call it the resistance than the first place\nIf you want to get in line drove an eight six six Ninety right I Will get to more of your calls in a comment on the uh uh Kavanaugh investigation FBI investigation and what\nThat is to get you know and what to Mitch McConnell may do and will there be a vote this weekend that more all on the way for video road log who's your forecast\nContinued range from what was hurricane Rosa will effect Southern California portions of south western Arizona and the central Rockies\nThrough at least tomorrow as much as three to six inches isolated amounts of ten inches of rain for areas are right up through the central Rockies you can expect some heavy rain again today alone areas or vi ten in Arizona sections of eyes forty south of the Grand Canyon\nAnd I Fifteen as you had from California through Vegas in Utah\nThe severe weather and heavy showers yesterday on the upper Midwest is moving off to the east we saw those heavy showers in Iowa portions of Wisconsin northern Illinois and Michigan today that system slowly most to the north and east we'll see rain for I eighty one all the way over to Seventy five\nWas going to win well no the the end but the point is that this was like dealing with the woman that was on CNN last week was the the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry Reid decided to change the rules of the Senate when he was\nThe head of the Senate when it came to federal nominations therefore when he did that\nUh you had Mitch McConnell come in and say okay you change those rules were going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice\nYeah the people in power we get to ... these aren't laws were not changing laws were simply changing rules of the sun it that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections as what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame somebody's a ... it's the fame somebody's character because that's the reality of how a Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the point that we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life time yeah positions that are at anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the moon I'm all Supreme Court justices we need to go back to the boom\nWell at least ... how often did you pick your mother that domestic abuse yes I'm Sorry\nIt's a little nutty to our last caller yeah just a little test a little ... little over the top and you wonder why [laughter]\n[noise]\nYeah [laughter] Kevin always take him and his mother's womb domestic assault\n\nYeah why not just a you know okay well we'll go back to daycare\nHe threw ice on someone [laughter]\nIn a bar legit I let well we do need to say that the kids were in a bar\n[laughter]\nBut this is this is the desperate attempt by the left when they know\nThey're losing even if Kavanaugh they just don't get the confirmation votes for Kavanaugh\nWhat do you do when the ...\n... [noise]\n[laughter] yeah well it's you know a Newsweek now pointing out that\nHe lied about having no connections to jail when they can show his grandfather attended Yale which would make him in turn a light just a legacy student\nIn two thousand eleven these prestigious universities including Yale Harvard Princeton said that roughly twenty five percent of their new admissions could be considered legacy students [noise] this is reaching\n[laughter] this is [laughter] ... [laughter] ... you\nMay have had too much to drink and then when you have to go home out\nWell I'll tell you [laughter] he he may have drank in high school and college\nI don't know how much I have to but I Hope to get to work everybody else's trip and I don't know how your address seriously dropping something I don't know what it is but I Would not driver operate heavy machinery anywhere in the near future let's say nothing before years in\nOh please Hoover home\n\nWhile I Can't believe we actually got a good oh yeah we need to go back to the womb\n[laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\n\n[laughter] yeah\n[laughter] wait a minute Ken I retire now if I Want to go\nOh hi want to go out on a high note I Want to say but last call I ever\nWell actually I saw the ... over the weekend\nOr if they actually may have been last week when Kavanaugh was born\nHe did what many male babies do on nurses yet on female nurses [laughter] he didn't make it in front of three nurse yeah and he was born at yes it's it's ... yeah well and if you're the if you've ever been in that room\nAnd witness that when a male is born also what they do\nAlmost first before they cry let's just say there's a reason they wear those gloves and masks\nWell so we're going to go back to that story about the college professor then [laughter] yeah right they\nGeorgetown professor who knows as white Republicans should be castrated and that just whine and fed this why yes a professor at Georgetown University known for making incendiary comments after Sherlock comment\nAgainst supporters of president Donald Trump said white Republican men deserve miserable deaths for supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid Christine fair and associate professor at Georgetown in the school of foreign service we didn't Saturday same white Republican men should die and an added bonus would be a woman ... their corpses and feed them just whine and to quote\nOkay\nUh well that went south quickly [laughter]\n\nWe can't have a debate [laughter] you can't have a debate that's the whole point you can't and this is what I said earlier and we got and there's further the this is further proof of it there's no coming back from the brink and the ... from the ... in terms of the far left in America today there's not a\nWell you ... you said ... well they come off the brain she's over it oh yeah yeah that's the study she made offensive comments on social media telling a Muslim Trump supporter to do\nMath off and go to hell ... Georgetown University said bears use our own and not the views of the university yeah right statement to the Daily Caller\nYeah in other words we don't want this to affect student enrollment were you know uh\nWe believe she might have crossed the line there that um [noise] I have a line in my mind and I know are just about where it is\nBy the way the last thing that we ever want to do this is why when we talk about free speech and they want to shut us up and we don't want to shut them up and that's why we don't want to shut them up we never want to stop\nThat Georgetown professor ... letting people know exactly what she thinks and that's why free speech is beautiful beautiful because she doesn't hide it you know who she is and what she is said and what she thinks\nAnd I don't think it's a Georgetown can make their own decision on whether she remains or not that's up to them we're not calling for anything we know we know what populate the halls of these universities we know who these individuals are please keep it up\nAt least through November of twenty two money now I Would put in if I you know the Daily Caller or was this in the Daily Caller ...\nDaily Caller yeah the deli Colorado had the story or did they did the Daily Caller contact pita to find out if\nI'm eating humans to swine is human parts to sign that this is I don't know I I think that's we need to talk you know we did anybody costs feed on this one because I'm a left upset I'm part of pets people for the ethical treatment of humans\n[noise] I'm not upset\nI'm actually kind of happy\nIt works politically it works keep it up eight six six Ninety right I\nThought you were told that it took six months he wrote a [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles than registered and joined the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dad come red eye radio and our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nSession will drive now with all the ones from the ... center says you can redeem your ultimate one points for reserve park\nThat's right now by popular request ultra one members can use their points to pay for a reserve parking space through reserve on line ... with the truck smart apps and remember ultra one he's evolving [noise] watch for new features\nTeachers and benefits rolling out later this year because you met her condition is the ultimate reward shock on more\nDebt ski we have hundreds of flatbed specialized million mile drivers blight because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national\nPower than we have a long term home for you to ask you as a family of sixty locally run flatbed and specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short haul or long haul [noise] want to drive our late model truck or your own try do you like to drive shown reserve tease\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads than the desk ... family of companies is your million mile hole if this along with consisted miles great pay and top tier benefits sounds like what you're looking for [noise] go to Dr ... dot com\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving without a preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's run I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fund cats scale and cover electronics we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say\n[noise] the AR I found when daily he's Arizona's new baby a are we asked them\nJessica Clement shot\nThirty four valley you Alberta, Canada [noise]\nThe scene in Las Vegas one year after the massacre the names of the fifty eight people killed by sniper James panic read at an anniversary vigil or the year and bump stocks are still legal pad to use the devices to convert a semi automatic rifles into fully automatic machine guns President Trump even made a promise\nWe're knocking out bump stocks and this is what happened over the next few weeks or so now the Justice Department also confirming to was that it has proposed a rule to ban bump stocks nationwide now that proposal is still under review it could last Ninety Days herself ABC's\nMatt Goodman on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination the FBI interviewed a woman who accuser Christine Blasey Ford said attended the same Nineteen eighties party where for to search she was attacked by Kevin ...

[noise]\n\nWhat about the jumble having show as we're talking tonight about the incredible turn of events that occurred in Mogadishu Somalia\nTwenty five years ago a barely a nation except in name it had disintegrated into chaos it was a well meaning motivation as you heard from the beginning of that trailer about this new documentary\nOr but nonetheless as they say about the road to hell in his often paved with good intentions we're talking with a couple of veterans of that particular conflict\nRetired brigadier general build David\nAnd a retired lieutenant colonel Michael ... and also another military veteran retired air force colonel Randy Larson the executive producer and director of the new documentary film\nOr just it was brought up I think that it's a good perhaps time for you to inject this before we returned to the other two guests Randy and that would be\nA a the a a bureaucracy ... through which you had to bludgeon your way uh how's how serious was that I mean did you receive a lack of cooperation or did you see outright opposition to what you're telling\nNo there was no opposition but trying to put a documentary film together is is that a nine month\nMarathon but at the at the paper in the spring when they get the facts right\nAnd it was a lot of different movies and documentaries and ... now but one of the most important things in that story is you know all the military leave the u._s. troops are simpler by George Herbert Walker Bush\nBecause people are starving to death in look in the morning and ... ... so we had to send troops over there and what they're for humanitarian reasons and then it started getting the incredible fight\nBut all senior military leaders and the man said we need some armored vehicles over there are groups get in trouble she lamb one case and Bradley fighting vehicle to protect them from the type of weapons the Somali a rebel head\nAnd secretary defiance laugh at once said no we're not going to send them so when general date it was colonel time and and and and\nHowever he was a major like when they had to go out there and rescue those rangers that the helicopters got shot down they had to go get Malaysian armored personnel carriers\nTheir troops out ... us troops in there the U.S troops couldn't speak the Malaysian\nIt's night there's this incredible fire going on I Can't even imagine what that must have been light and so as I've been doing this research I mean I didn't so impressed with everybody from the AFC but court or\nYou are but corporal ... and CEOs who are incredible the senior in CEOs and and the leaders like a a bill ... and that's who you should really be talking through here because first of all we should never put American troops in that position where we tell them here's a mission to go do but what you're not going to give you the resource that you say you need\nAnd and but I I'm just so proud that we get to honor these veterans ... Mountain Division here on the twenty fifth anniversary\nWell I certainly would concur with you entirely I remember at the time although not realizing the extent to which was true but at the time uh when I was still I was doing this program as a matter of fact it's been a long time and I remember\nA severely castigated the defense secretary Les Aspen for worrying about cosmetics about whether or not and and then one tank would make us look less like a peacekeeping mission at the time I thought you know images is baloney uh although I was using stronger language and that ... let's talk to a\nA General David ... about that that part of this or that in retrospect would you say that you that you were sent into combat\nOr which which is what it was it what it turned out to be into combat with less than the resources that they should have been made available to you\nWell I think a commander with a would always want more resources but I think the uh um officers who were in command positions senior to me made it very clear\nTo the national command authorities that um\nArmored vehicles were required for survivor ability and um and to basically protect our fourth so yes obviously um [noise] you know the more arm or you can have around your anytime it's usually pretty good thing so um yeah we we certainly could have used it but we didn't have it\nYou know uh the situation dictated that will use what we had and so that's what we do\nThat is true and ... yes yes please continue ran a yes\nNo I just want to build David my that would be went into the gunfight at night in a hungry and I'm armored Humvees and light might that in the trailer it's like going in you know in a convertible Corvette and a parade everybody shooting at and they were in on armored on be more than a thousand people chew\nAnd we all recall what happens do armored Humvees when they get hit with let's say ...\nAnd ... ... uh it it was I assume common knowledge to everyone back then that among those forces active in Mogadishu at the time were those with RPGs rocket propelled grenades or certainly more than a match for ah for example for a Humvee or right\n[noise] well I think that's true but I think you also have to look at it in context at least from my perspective you know the basic mission was to go in and and the safely protects humanitarian assistance operations that were designed to be starving Somalis I don't think anybody anticipated\nI'm going into into a firefight I think part of that was a lack of recognition and in in my own over the last twenty five years that a lot of time to think about it and we we have this term called peacekeeping operations in for my perspective there's another peaceful about those kinds of operations\nI'm In this case you had a set of ... you had to drive ... and having a beer\nYou brought the un and the un became a third drive by the power who was the uh the the thing that had the most value they're fighting for that and I'm In it escalated I mean there were things that occurred back in June and July with the out of the house raids\nAnd I don't think the folks at home recognize that there was a firefight\nOr by until we got to where I go and so\nI think a lot of the calls for armor that we're not consistent with the information that was coming out of theater with regard to what was going on\nWell maybe not to the general public I Would have to think the defense secretary Aspen had that information\nI think that's probably true ah but I'm not sure that he had the ability and I can't really speak for was asked when I mean I I can only tell you the perspective that the folks that I was around on the ground have at the time\nAnd that was that the generally speaking a there was a very little information that was flowing out of Somalia back to uh either D.C or back to to ah to centcom\nTo indicate what was really going on in theater so I don't I'm not sure that they really understood how many firefights we'd already been in prior to the third and fourth of October\nThere enough where the pause briefly will come back with some more one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six we'll be back in just a moment\nArizona's news station Katie our news on Ninety two three F.

took place in Mogadishu\nOr up to ...\nI'm Sorry that was to General David yes yeah\nOkay um well in the summer I mean it was an Eighteen hour a day or the rescue effort took Eighteen hours and it it it involves one ah one failed attempt does a lot of the um pointed out earlier and the other day that a secular\nThey then a second attempt and I'm the second attempt we actually picked up some uh some small elements of the um the ground delta force that was there as well as some of the rangers and um [noise]\nUh in the course of the battle of we had a you know not surprisingly we had a lot of unexpected things happened we had some other what's called breaks in contact some vehicles went the wrong direction I'm broke off from the main element we had to recover them um and ah\n[noise] I guess the the thing that probably took the longest was extraction of the bodies out of the uh some uh the attitude the helicopter landed was ah was actually it was a\nUm that he flipped over and so it was very difficult to get those bodies out so um [noise] uh and intense fighting the entire time uh getting to the crash site for a while we were on the crash sites and then extraction off the crash site so I'm\nIf you've seen the movie a Black Hawk down this Randy mentioned earlier the the movie does a very very good job of portraying the intensity of the battle and uh it was a\nThere was a long night\nVery much so tell us about the battle from your perspective the colonel Michael ...\nBut I I think it's pretty much as colonel David pointed out of the I I Will use kind of as an example um you know as we turn down a the the main route towards the object of say a it was almost as if the entire world opened up and everybody started shooting at us\nAnd then uh once uh the two companies began to return fire\nUm you could you could almost feel that the change in the atmosphere that we had now again the the ... gained momentum and so Charlie company went south and uh and and drew mar which in and out of it and move to the\nCrash site were to walk out was and that we sat in the middle of the street in the command Humvee or with mortar rounds walking their way down the road a an RPG\nWas flying I thought you know this is a this is not going to be one of those days where everybody goes home and uh\nAnd I and I at that point um and there was some level of recognition when colonel day we got on the net and said\nYou know we're going to stay here as long as it takes\nTo get everybody out of here and I and I think that that statement at that time was that created a calming effect do
