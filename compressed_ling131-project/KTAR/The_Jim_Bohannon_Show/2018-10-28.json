I've always felt pretty smart with money so I have a positive net worth right now four hundred thousand between my four oh one big assets and I'm home equity so\nI I'm not terrible but I just want to know\nWhat what kind of way gas that's the you\nKnow what are your for one\nI have a hundred thousand and\n\nThanks\nFive two to five Andy I'm Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy because there were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] really but things were going by guys are yeah thanks for having a excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and will laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n[noise] the camp will be a uh\nThe the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or um we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it so\nMuch time and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and then the nonprofit you would sit down and talk\nAbout what kind of a\nYou know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I Would be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the turn of the good so the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the non profit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or camp ensure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and\nBecause I rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit a ... I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying is a treat these things separately and your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it they might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you'd said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that right airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that righteous policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs to this much and this kind of a company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually\nThe individual part will be a lot cleaner 'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight anything of this I'm\nNo ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from\nYou cannot contract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh and because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a hall Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk I but I hold harmless is\nThat what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps honest people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I\nI Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still lives so I mean ... they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you and thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five\nFive two to five you're jumping

Apologize if this is something that you've touched on what\nI'm new to the baby step and I know that number one we have the thousand dollar and mark and the fun mhm my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in a stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry\nI'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened to us we really lucky we've never been laid off and let you go in and they get home pretty quick I mean within a couple of weeks\nShe'd have a couple of weeks to do something ... going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up in five of his buddies were laid off last week I Would push pause on the whole told them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile up guy but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that [noise]\nPay its Mac Watson for tackled

I Would not want to pick up the premiums on the half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot of policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a port right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo our whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n\nAnd so if you just called me up and you just owned a half a million dollars of whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and said that\nUh I'm going to go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be hanging over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't mind if they pay for something that you know not only that it could have fallen packet\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan plan has now changed yep 'cause you you may have ... as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nDavid how are you today better than I deserve what's up\nYeah I have a question uh regarding out part of my retirement savings come I called it ... from my company [laughter] and that overall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as a\nMatter of your favorites or pension\nOh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be about eight percent of my code will have had you know and\nAnd my question is whether it be kept as a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter]\n'cause we're all going to die or get when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch of it and you get ... if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live are as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred and eighty five thousand you could roll went into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family\nWell that'd be a better deal right\nYeah I did [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but Mm uh\nIt's still one of your dog then yeah you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept applies so the ... the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest\nI make this a bad deal and\nSo you always take pension lumps on almost always take Benjamin lumps arms enroll them to IRAs and invest them and good gross struck me to open so it sounds like you're networks didn't exist Romanian\nUh yet uh closer to close the ... and that's probably about four oh well they're total\nTotal network to assets house yes hopefully\nNo nowhere ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my ah my family and my wife ...\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was that before that happened\nOr ... or my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents were eligible young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is ... maybe ... maybe ... percent\nAnd it's it's home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell that twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise] well\nI certainly you got to a live well below your means when they got a modest lifestyle which we have done\nAnd I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done a stupid thing which I think if you can limit\nStupid thing I should do along the way that's good I like that\nBecause because every every everybody listening right now is has done or will do\nStupid things but then you can minimize those should remain ... along the way and live a modest lifestyle with below you mean um yeah void\nSo do you think there'll be done and that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably a probably even higher if they if they minimize so stupid it maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir menu done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and the ... all the math on that works to your benefit a at a wall of live if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor sure you come out three hundred grand ahead\nA thank you for joining us

[noise] yeah one of those out and all these guys\nGet you get a twelve days away from uh the uh the mid term elections\nI went out and early voted yesterday uh went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me\nRight it was pouring rain or just ... ... and when it was funny 'cause I've never even though this campus is only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been to never drove through this community college right oh drove through what the science route front of you know the that you you could tell me okay this is early voting political signs all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because of political science will be all over the plate right right yeah and they were\nThe only thing is they didn't have any parking\nIf you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a court house right uh where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said that\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before you know I had about a thousand foot ... pouring rain but when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter what the ... is ... outside the anger the rage that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I Walk into a polling place hey how you doing everybody's laugh and joke in what's going on what you're doing and they had the the the new don't didn't have to actually sign\nYou know how you're supposed you sign you know that okay is this your ... you don't sign any more you sign on a tablet ignoring the tablet around you signed right on the tablet mhm you know with the little Pence who I could guess I could have signed with my finger I said this is new they said yet makes it real easy uh\nProbably because there was nobody behind me in line\nOr just have to\nSleazy ah probably because there was nobody behind me in line\nOr just have to just general conversation\nYou know hasn't been busy think the reins affecting that they said yeah the rains have backed into today 'cause it's been pretty crowded\nAnd then just you know one right up and there were three or four machines that were open and\nWent in and voted and it was done now the interesting thing is I was wondering since I'm a college campus well let's see young people voting yeah there were [noise] yeah that's right we're voting debt\nA used to do all the time you know public speaking I never have told people go out and vote ... ... because ... number one I never felt that was my real number two I never felt the people that were listening to what I had to say had to be encouraged about well this is the great\nThing about especially our audience I I think the the people that listen to our show and and and especially I think beyond or just new listeners the ones that have been with us for\nA while I Believe there you know we're all\nKinds of standing in the in that same line you you were were part of that that same mentality and again they're they're leaving themselves I Know they don't need me to say and they know they don't need me to say it and that's the great thing there is that uh that that understanding and\nAnd the only thing I I I think I mean we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know were needed for is the fact that there are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their jobs they got their families\nAnd our job any of them were eating right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day and what's going on in the issues in a different form that they get from anything else and and I would say that's about it now\nAnd I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do well\nThat's you know makes me feel useful [laughter] I mean that that's what we are I mean the the the uh think of it as a concierge service of information that right I mean there are there people out there that it and many of them on the other side of that are very well informed and just tune into here's the smarmy\nYeah some do [noise] all my friends do the weirdos [laughter] you know I mean

yeah yeah down or over six hundred points\nSo ah ... the you know here's the other side of I guess and not a lot of media on on that obviously the media was on everything else that was going on uh with the suspicious packages and everything but\nYou or the administration and they're they're probably looking at this going okay as we go in and get what are you know again twelve days out from the mid term they need to build some momentum so they need to I guess return\nUh some of that are positive stuff to back to the market uh we'll see where it goes uh in terms of ah any kind of rebound later today or or maybe next week if that has to happen but you can bet they are watching this and a lot of it has to do with trade and tariffs\nSo the material costs especially with steel and aluminum right now you have and the retaliatory tariffs on\nRemember also the the I Believe the temperatures are still in effect from earlier this year on Canada timber coming until NAFTA is actually sign right or whatever it is the new the new the new nagging we're not calling now [laughter] All right\nUh but as far as I and and so housing has gone up you know we look at it was an apartment complex behind us\nAnd and it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred today it's it's pretty bad yes you ... uh and the race\nAnd this and and it's I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred there it's pretty big issue ... uh and the rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you would hire totally asking\nWhy why is it going so slow is a labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment developer or in North Dallas for video wrote log here is your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan at upstate New York the south will be drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend\n\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration\nBecause they have not just about the attack\nThat they are for open borders thing go we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and uh earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do you support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\nHe said again I've argued outs where the party should have embraced and immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this was a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discussed was a\nWas a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm\nWhich was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions to a couple of weeks after you and I started working together\nRight and so for Thirteen Years Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be\nThinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration\nIt shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said you make the accusation\nDemocrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssued them the challenge and that's what we've shown is saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't\nIssue them the challenge and that's what we've shown is saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had\nTo they don't then they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats won border security they may have compassion for people that are\nHere and want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we brought ... to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ...\nWhen you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat\nMhm no the American people Sam with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want at all you know the president wants you know what the Republicans won\nAnd and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll poll well we're going to pull aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people ...\nYep\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag ... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then you know go back and then we have to have that discussion\nAs to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that\nPoint no how can you have a discussion when only one side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party that endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silence is your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow That's Douglas shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage a isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting\nForced to say the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who and\nI mean the ... from the party\nThat is actually saying that in promoting is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard of but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle how can we ever how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination of bodies they won't even have the debate right right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will be is the question eight six six Ninety read I\nRead a book on board with are ready to do with a record ...
