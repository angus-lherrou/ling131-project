President Trump's most outspoken and loyal supporters they have the new documentary out dummy ... a big premier earlier this week and now they are looking ahead to making this was able\nTo all of their fans all across the country you two are real life sisters were North Carolina's\nWe're real life started ... ... from the same cloth ten months apart so they collar Irish Twins\nYou you'd when was the first time you do realize that maybe more than just your friends and neighbors might be interested in hearing you\nAgain on this we never knew all of that if you ever want to make you laugh your plans don't plant any at this here we only had two people on her YouTube channel right you know people were going to hear if we were going to resonate\nWe were just they were trying to be honest candid and open the window up here too because sometimes you do that you got\nTo get some things off of our cats because it's not like the way they were doing in Donald Trump\nHim under the bus and back in that but on him but no reason at all he had been in the public I thought all these years and not one that they call them those nasty nasty and they got a running against Hillary Clinton\nWell there's certainly there was a shall we say a major turnaround in it and when they want when he won\nThen obviously a that is something that a major sector of this country has not come to terms with they cannot accept that he was making not accept that he signs bills into law they cannot accept to be he dictates national policy in accordance with the\nThe constitution of this was a major problem for men and it's been now two years and I'm not sure exactly when this was going to sink in it yeah he really did win\nWith olive accomplishment look at what he's a team for two years have done more than Obama could do an eight year they don't like that than President Trump is not\nA career politician either businessman I always say if you want to know what's going on with the body look at the head to head is profit and for for the body of people are going to be profit is the best one look at today what's happening\nBut there's no question about the fact that he's really had a a major impact and I'm Wondering how you you got to be connected with his campaign I mean obviously there are a lot of people out there who\nWho are rally to his his support but not many people have gotten to actually speak at a at a rally is held up for a candidate Trump and President Trump how did you come to the attention of the Trump campaign\nAnd tell somebody from is kept it out\nUm and it just it felt he came in North Carolina there was no way they it was going to be in North Carolina we not be there so it was a race for us to be one of his rallies\nHe invited on stage as might we didn't have to take his bike he gave it to us to let us say whatever we want to say in front of all of those cameras back there to back with it was probably over it up and\nOut after that that was just it just snowballs out there that I think that next January and Mississippi open up for a rally and we've opened up so many of them yeah I'm I just can't count on it for granted we didn't we didn't have to talk to anybody\nUm it I just can't column listen they didn't plan it we didn't we didn't have to talk to anybody and it's always been like that it's just everything just don't bother to all this and I\nReally think about it I'm President Trump Donald Trump at the time he is about the people he or the people real people um he's not you can have all these different degrees or what have you uh and just be so politically correct\nDonald Trump he's just a real person if you remember before he ran for president I mean he ... he looked at who he hung out with the real people like he was not even a a billionaire\nEven though he has a billionaire he just didn't act out any I don't get about yeah I hear what the people and the people and he was because he had us go ahead\nYes he hurt us and if you look at it even right now in his presidency he's bypassing all of these organizations and taking it directly\nTo the people nobody bought him he's not beholden to Hollywood or the lobbyist nobody bought him\nA paid him off he's only beholden to the people that voted him in office\nI analyze it all and look at the left wing media how they spend the laziest gossip stories live and they only mayor who they fear they fear him because they know he's win and they don't try to stop losers but they will try and stop all winter\nAnd now they they certainly are there I've taken a menu of course now do you are women you are African American and oh that really sets off the the far left crowd because you people have minds of your own and you're not doing what you're told to do and that\nThey didn't anticipate that they will come along a diamond is it and pay that people will start speaking out like ... you know they wanted us up here or to continue with the same two three\nAs thinking on the inside of the box jumped did not say nothing every member now because of what Obama did back in the day I'm a gay people fill staff that Obama didn't create an atmosphere for economic opportunity for people he put what how they would want to end up with a puppet\nAnd the puppet masters will have to look at how the leaders are so upset with down but the Trump upset with President Trump because he's not into those elite is he has to be African American person and that's the least working for it and they do not like it\nNow I now I have to ask you about this where did the names diamond and silk come from\nWhat go into political atmosphere back in two thousand and Fifteen it was really really rough and it was very nasty so we could not go out with our\nGovernment and they really want

[noise] really laugh\nAnyway they don't present both sides of the story ... at at any of the universities here as far as I Know and their children today are being brainwashed it's a social\nUh it\nIt's terrible what's going on\nAnd I don't know ... people\nNow my rights to assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you've got your do now these ... pretty far less you had a good prime minister before that\nOh had ties to leave this wonderful uh and [noise] we had our um our debt was not a big deal at all we hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAs soon as they put him in a to do because of his name uh you know what he graduated from was um\nUh what do you call that [noise]\nUm [noise]\nActually yeah when they went to school for acting still doing it during his acting\nYou thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister still continuing now the official prime minister Ali\nBoy it makes you ever wonder why we ever win an election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the lady one reaches mail anymore daughters sisters a son is it just doesn't seem to matter how ...\nHow do we ever win elections well I guess we're just finding the people that they won't talk to us into friend us so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that so you don't know who they are\nLet's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be that fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and see I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member McCarthy was you know calling everybody communist and with whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come to an let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this I Am a part time teacher and they don't know\nThat I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that it was probably a conservative talk show hosts\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably conservative talk show hosts are some liberals and most of them are not among many have you know what shepherd I been what what kind of America to we have\nIn twenty tea and when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about\nAll right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video road law\nDangerous flooding continues in Texas there'll be a little strange today to the forecast\nMore showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday for the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms were eastern Florida Today\nHigh pressure from the east and west coast of metal made clear skies don't look for clouds in the inner mountain west or the west coast also the deep south will be\nHey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect that is having on relationships friends\nFamily colleagues um I've had experiences where I I quit ... five years ago because I just couldn't take reading some of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to\nJump in here and and you know say something LED lights and regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because\nIt was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a ... with a lot of relationships you know\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you became I've learned not to say much about politics and\nThe ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can see if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nAnd that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nHello mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I our our list do a lot of community radio appear where I'm at and she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know all that up KBC CBS NBC or just\nRegurgitate it everything [noise]\nThere's a price part and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do what's best can not get the candidate that the media was trying to ...\nAnd that worked out in the end show all this horrific stuff that came off of a a ... and a a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and green\nOr all of that probably helped a jet of Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called Bush a we'd already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years\nBut the reason I called was so we had already been told\nA for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to stretch the inner cities and you're the racial issues that we had to confront\nAt a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected lowered his mandate anywhere\nScare off on another ... and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or your the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review disappointed and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time\nWell I think if they voted for him because uh they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was my first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rat Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof\nBut I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike trouble then is a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois you're on with mark\nHey mark I've got to average ... observations and then a point to make a first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always\nThe liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states\nThat we have powers as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ... but they're fascist themselves\nAnd they you know when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives\nSo I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be a little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the ... Democrats that you could count on to be monitored the scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave you'd be Republican today\nThe Democrat Party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he'd six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark I serve on red eye radio\nWhere would I Do have these are [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise] right now as he ain't Petro stopping centers wonderfully strong and soft wonder Jill purple extreme seat cushions on sale for only sixty four Ninety seven\nThe tough tested Bowers lead is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to run I radio for up to date information and be sure to follow red eye radio and tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter for information\nTwo and a red eye radio for up to date information and be sure to follow red eye radio and top tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter for information on tour stop of as an promotions if you see this try to take a picture posted on Instagram and be entered to win great prices at hashtags\nAttack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you\nTruckers quick question for you how\nDo you say in a chain when you're not on the road some truckers watch DVDs on laptops others just bring a book on their homes some people even resorted truck stop TV or spotty wife by no thank you me I like to unwind at the end of the day but live HDTV in my cab\nAnd what does portable satellite antennas it's easier than ever mounted to your roof are still until your day is over then just shut them up in your sleep or gas tenders or lightweight shut up and minutes and don't require a life like an action blood it gets even better with this there is no longer TV contract with this thing is you go programming you pay\nFor only the much actually use check it out at this from my truck\nDuck fleet owners want to give your truckers the comfort of home on the road is Gigi ... perfect for leads to an older TV you love to watch it at home in the comfort of your cab\nAnd you won't have to put up with trucks or GV ever again find out more dish for much drug dot com today restrictions apply\nAmong those as a trucking luggage\nSpecializes in the graveyard shift [noise]\nWith conflict because he is protected by progressive commercial into his truck if he's in an accident so he doesn't have a daughter [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "19"}
