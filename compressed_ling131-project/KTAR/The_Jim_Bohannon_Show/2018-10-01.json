the globe doctor regular people just like you and me in the hot zones we hear their stories and then hopefully we can connect the dots visited a just a second run to Europe and later on in the hour we're into Iran next hour the change is hard segment\nThat has a video segment you can watch inside the\nPleasure Lee appointed studios that voice to America as well as listen flake in an elevator global reaction to what we witnessed here in the United states from where this a show originates with our Supreme Court hearing\nWe will take a what we always do and that is offering foreign view you know in our global media spotlight segment this is how we monitor foreign media how they cover stories about America are that are important to America we've got more than usual today\nBecause this is not a uniquely American story\nAnd it's not for the reasons that most people think you're going to hear from people about cabinet versus Ford from outside the United states today nobody from inside the United states everybody from outside the United states you may be asking like many of you've already said\nA including the crack staff voice of America we even came in today and they said\nThis is a big story outside the United states I said yes it is but not for the reasons that you may think and you'll be hearing from different folks from around the globe and how they view the spectacle that is going on is that a political spectacle is a social justice spectacle it is it a gender spectacle\nIs it a a power spectacle you're going to find out if you've been following the story like everybody else also Poland wants Trump when we're always told that Europe doesn't want Trump well somebody in Europe wants Trump also\nThis is a perfect example of what we talk about\nWhen we say that one of the pillars the voice of America program is popular media forms public opinion public opinion for public policy\nIn the last two forty eight hours or so there was a shoo nominee\nThat hit Indonesia\nThe death toll is climbing quickly to a thousand the last I checked it was a bit about nine hundred is expected to continue to go high mass devastation but at this almost as if it is a story that doesn't exist in the United states\nNow we'd love to cover our weather events here as we know what happened in North Carolina just a week or two ago and which still going on in Puerto Rico for instance we love to cover certain events but again I ask you the question\nIf you're going to cover one hurricane don't you have to cover pretty much all the hurricanes and if you're going to justify covering one hurricane even if it is a look we're in American media company this hurricane happens in America\nThat's fine but does Indonesia not count\nWe already talked about the more massive hurricane that hits a Asia\nAll of Asia uh almost\nSimultaneous to the one in North Carolina and again it's almost\nWe'll be applying to be talking about today when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh it is more of an institutional issue\nAnd a business model issue than it is this idea of I'm right or wrong or social justice or no social justice or progressive versus status quo but most folks don't think about it that way\nDeep problem that that's you know if you have a president who doesn't quite\nAs I follow the rules or understand how these things should work\nUh I think you actually look at a situation where is putting straining under the U.S it's usually not these credit frankly in some ways that the institutions haven't yet broken\nUm and I actually think that this is something we should be watching out for what she very casually is if an institution gets broken and perhaps if a this Supreme Court nomination goes through\nBrett Kavanaugh is not going to escape this forever\nHis whole career on the Supreme Court if you get that will be tainted by this if he frankly if you have any sense\nHe'd withdrawing himself but I'm the eyes you Davis and he says he should I should withdraw from nice and clean up this process um but I also think is raised questions about the fact that you have a Supreme Court judge for life with no process of getting rid of them\nAre that's mark from Europe to get us started on this edition of voice to America so that's the first foreign look at the story that not only riveted the nation but you will soon find out riveted the world there's a reason why is it really about the Supreme Court justice is really about the me too movement is it about sexual assault and sexual harassment or is it about something completely else\nLike most things are there are more than one\nBut ultimately I think when you heard what mark was talking about at the end we said this is an illuminated as best we can we're at a time in which change really is going to be hard and institutions remember that word institutions\nHave no confidence America where the world comes to talk [noise]\nContacting Lucian delusion were driving revenue and creating brand

back to ... get out of Europe to get started on this edition of voice of America our next stop will be with one of our Iranian voices out of Trump do at the United nations\nAs he previewed for you all last week the big showdown of every\nA democratically elected leader to bit strong man\nA puppet master they all show up in New York for a few days and that's what happened this past week into Trump's course had lots of time to talk and hold press conferences and one of the sites predictably was wrong and that's the next big deal he hopes to get going and moving\nMaybe like he did and has been doing a with North Korea we're going to get an Iranian perspective of how Trump did this past week in New York\nYou heard a lot of help you did and unless you're just tuning in what mark had to say a from Europe about these showdown between ... and Ford this past weekend at the end I asked him and his thoughts about institutions and where we are this should not be anything new\nBut it's still continues to amaze me that ah folks are still ... or at least feign a ... there flummoxed by this idea that you know institutions like the Supreme Court or like Senate hearings or like our institutional media\nYou know how do we arrive at what we saw this past week here in the United states we're all sitting back and say we've never seen it it's never quite gone like this before and uh\n... and it shouldn't be a surprise because all over the world this is not uniquely American we have detailed it for you but there is this a battle that also goes on of this idea of\nA that institutions that are obviously under threats at first you know those of you that like to watch people like Oprah ah they she's very good you know the five\nStages of recovery and others denial and then there's anger and then there's acceptance and there's all of that and this is what we're seeing workout of course is is that you know you're under threat nothing to see here no problem\nYou know ... that's an aberration that clearly must have been a mistake if we just felt another vote today obviously people would come to their senses and they realize how great all of the European institutions actually are\nThe same thing with Trump oh it must be a mistake it must be some type of a conspiracy\nIf we could just vote over again or we could just change the rules 'cause he's illegitimate then we just bringing Hillary and everything would be just just honky dory\nOr we've we've heard all of that but that's been going on now for a couple of months I mean remember you know if you believe many of the institutional leaders some of them are still in control whether it's your education system your media system your banking system\nA Trump should have been long gone remember he was supposed to be crazy and they went through the public examination of how he wasn't fit for office and then he was supposed to leave it anytime and then he was eating too many big Macs\nAnd that because he ate too many big Macs he was going to die of a heart attack and then he wasn't gonna be able to make it\nAnd then there was talk of the the ongoing talk of Russia I mean it goes on and on and on again I mean just remember it was almost two years ago that\nWhen Trump got elected there was you know getting on our popular media and through our popular media they said you know the economy is going to crush little countdown doomsday clocks were watching the ... the markets around the globe whatever it wherever they may be they're all going to crash except that they didn't crash and they did the exact opposite people forget that\nBut this is how it was set up and again the critical thinkers has to say why is this institution doing this you know what led them to put a doomsday clock and make all of these protections\nThat have now been proven to be wrong I mean clearly this is two years ago now they're all like you know the the they say I heard I read\nThat the market you're going to plunge because people are so upset with Donald Trump an exit for instance the exact opposite but they never go back and revisit it and say how do we get this wrong again\nAnd this was right after you know they did all the math and we always talk about like John King who should be doing hockey scores now for CNN not because he's a bad guy but he's bad at what he does remember remember the lead up he says you know we've played the clip for you\nMathematically there's absolutely no scenario where Donald Trump can win the presidency and he showed the big board and all this fancy you know mumbo jumbo hieroglyphics and he had all those three D. animation and all of this he kept telling us there's absolutely no way that this could happen\nAnd then there is no explanation of it they just move on and they just said okay let's keep going you know this must be a legitimate then that's that's what these institutions to so now\nWe're arriving whatever size that you were on with the Supreme Court is now an institution that is clearly crumble and you're seeing you in the Senate is under pressure on these judiciary her clearly under pressure\nOur legal backbone which is this idea you're innocent until proven guilty which also influences are public sense of fairness innocent until proven guilty that's being challenged left and that is a mighty institutionally still ... itself whereas now are the skills to Iran is next [noise]\nI'm here with her who works with my trainer Carl Chanel of longevity personal training herb I understand you have quite the store\nHenri I've always been an active person including swimming four to five days a week a few years ago I began to experience shoulder pain to the point that I couldn't swim without any pain at all\nAfter one failed shoulder surgery I went back for a second one and even then and after seeing a physical therapist my shoulder just wasn't the same and I still couldn't get back in the pool without pain\nWhich is obvious with Iran sanctions have already been in place these are new sanctions or in about a month the really painful sanctions the banking and the oil sanctions loom\nAnd a ... neither leader Matt but they talked about meeting ... spoke cross paths we're sitting here in the United states\nAs we speak today Donald Trump's last big public messages as Rouhani apparently had left the country was he said you know I'd like to meet Rouhani I understand he's an absolutely lovely man and that's where I start with camera and I asked him you know when the president or the United states Donald Trump says Rouhani is that you don't get I from what I understand it would be a lovely man what do you think the reaction is to ...\n... it was nice uh when he said that by the tea also say that this but the quest I'm not planning to have meeting yeah no you're on the M. believed that that that was in a request\nAnd that so he is is he want to keep the option open but I'm not sure if it's as if it's a\nSincere I Believe that he does want to meet and he doesn't have problem meeting any of this to so few middle either or Rowhani unlike a lot of other US President but I don't think that uh it's going to happen or assume\nAnd then there's also\nThat if you really also say I'm not just in CNN there for ten minutes ago but before that us is not in a state to attack Iraq I'm mainly tune the he may be making a mistake so he's\nConcentrating on on the end and the violence a negotiation or\nIran's foreign minister Sharif also said that he is close to a deal to sell oil to Europe do you think you can really pull off a deal if you really think he convinced Europe\nTo violates what are the United states uh is is this likely going to do with oil sanctions and us banking\nUm I think he's basing his comment on the UPN or activities in in in the way that they want to create\nAnd and then and then I'm banking system so that Iran can sell these oil to other countries not using dollar or ... years old\nAnd he's trying to convince that are you guys need to start taking really said he is as quick action because\nThe patient of Iran is not going to be patient and so I read on it's not going to be for forever so he is pushing it from the other night [noise]\nWe don't know if this um this combination of communication between eight banks seven banks in Europe for the work out\nBut they are very optimistic that this would be a way to prevent Tricia from Iraq um a lot of yeah and other people don't believe that US can force eat on to bring kids production or is exposed\nTo zero that's is that is not through I'll just say\nWell they'll sell it to China we know that but the idea of of Europe is of of your defined Trump because they may not like Trump but ultimately they're going to have to convince businesses also the banks the businesses are to to follow along in in in violate the sanctions\nOr do you think it's likely that Europe and these European business is not just take the banks did you think European banks with with thumbed their nose or Donald Trump at this point and don't play ball with Iran and defied Trump\nTeam by their very you would do is not just to save either on or save a save a\nNuclear deal or is is also a kind of opposition to the U.S administration Trump's policy yeah because they have put you and also the other partners of this agreement on to coordinate that if you\nStart having business as usual and indeed on your column part of this would be suffering and that we have seen that you as us has not been kidding joking about this this is very serious so it's not just to\nBut it's not just to help ease on and I think is is Tricia from UPN that we need to stand against us and you need to protect our interests and and I don't know I don't have the expertise to say if it's been worth or not but\nI think that uh if they don't eat on would get out of the nuclear agreement\nAnd and that's created this situation at least for a European much much harder because they are not having good they are fundamental difference policies Sunday had a couple of years ago but us does\nOkay a couple of comments that were made of the United nations week this past week Trump or spent his big speech sand and even when he chaired the meeting on weapons of mass destruction\nHe spent his time publicly a strong language against Iran was there anything in in Trump's words you think that pot or Iran off guard or which particularly valuable to the Iranian government\nSo I was expecting much much worse uh um speech from President Trump last week really what how she'll say how how so worse\nI was expecting that the Trump would come up with a list of uh things that you don't need to take care of otherwise\nUh this is going to happen that's gonna happen similar list as the secretary of state or came up with a couple of months ago\nAnd I was this vaccine that the problem would want to basically be a ... says is maintaining\nMembers of the un national\nSecurity that they would uh they would have to take the similar action that we are we are proposing I find is a fish much much less from from\n... done that before I understand that he said that Iran has all the money is this and this and this was very softly in comparison to\nLast me you know of him and Iran is also I'm saying that this all or nothing new we are not a war said on a\nTuesday or ... and um they are getting a lot of people are listening to what they say when when it comes to the studio at Abby and they cannot Iran is trying to\nConvince Iranians that the U.S is against us not because we are involved with this and this\nBut mainly because as soon as he at IBM and other countries are feeling that they are in in in ... they don't also understand I I I have to have made that Iran has always play negative role in the region\nBut come on in comparison to what ... what ... is doing some of us on the puzzle to to to not their family around you and\nUh when it comes to sue ... because they they purchasing military equipment like ... like they are purchasing candy for the kids and they are expecting that\nThey asked to believe that Iranians they're more a dungeon in the middle east done done ... so Iranians are\nHaving a conversation and they don't believe that to the idea because you had to be a minister of couple of years ago I think in in ... vote or the\nThe ah ... the king of the some of the king said that we bring the or do war inside Iran so that is a very sensitive when it comes to how ...\nWhat are the other comments the Trump made during his his big public speech in front of the general assembly is he said that he accomplished more than any other president it was almost a a throwaway line it wasn't a particularly big grandiose dramatic point he was making but\nThe entire hall started laughing and then Trump pause and then he even started laughing at the laughter the reaction what did you make of that camera and I mean what do you think was going on\nI was watching it too and I are kind of a little bit\nI was the chalk that the public would react that way and I think that if he didn't say the last war that uh he has been more successful than any other president than history of America in the last for would be much less but it it was kind of\nExpect that from President Trump to say things like this and and uh and Iranians uh I have a little bit thicker skin so they they they they find that that is uh\nVery funny but it didn't get much attention that was the last couple of pause trying to make a fool of em but it didn't go well you know the onion community they they they cut the conversation\nYeah do you think it was your interpretation though of of of the hall laughing at Trump was it because\nYour

looked at how everything sounds always using catty cutting edge technology and a sparing no expense you get an actual video props into some ideas of what we're not only just talk about the video props\nTo help enhance the experience so\nAh we have today are two issues of lake in an elevator and a Costa Panthers put together by the the crack staff to help us navigate this weekend to you know what I think too is is when one of these\nBigger than usual moments that is really hard to say in this day and age in which everybody's excited about everything and as we always say uh you know it's exactly the way those folks that are in power watch you and me you know when your lower on the food chain\nEverybody wants to keep you on an emotional state because you're more easily manipulated they don't want to keep you in an intelligence tape because that's going to be a problem [noise] ah so\nThat's one of the things that we will cover today and how people react to all of that now we bring in a certified millennial and vice president of technology a Adam who puts this program together I can tell by your few working in the background we already screwed up the technological part of the\nYeah I'm ... good ... what happened no audio for the video a video while you know\nOf audio now it's just oh inherently out of the studious and when you play a clip play it over the monitor\nOh so this is the equipment that I pay for I pay thousands of dollars this is supposed to be cutting edge it's\nIs it a human errors at a technicolor as a technicolor I'm guessing that the human area I'm going to guess it's a human error [laughter] that's always the that tells me it's a human error that's that's part of the changes are un air it's never my fault it's somebody else's fault you know how many times for instance\nA ... everybody needs a nemesis the David versus Goliath story it's biblical little pebble in the shoe and Donald Trump is cast Jim Acosta it's just punching bag and CNN lobster and the cost of loves it because you know he gets to be the news well they're special right again you're scaling\nWhat differentiates your product how can you appeal to more people you know again if you're just another White House reporter in a room literally of thousands of of reporters\nTried to be special any all our guy cost us ... not intentionally but you know by the Trump the shows that we might as well roll with it because it costs a lot lower on the food chain and the president of the United states who happens to be Donald Trump\nSo this past week and in classic pandering fashion this is at the United nations\nInternational media and if for some reason instead of asking a question about to Donald Trump he decides to well what's it look let's just play it and go ahead\nIf you don't mind after I finished if we'd you're highly or for Vivian and one of our female colleagues could go after me that would be great um as far as in just a follow up on these allegations against\nWhat ... what does he mean by that explains what what is what I mean I think the great of a female what is it ... you know what does it mean to be ready for female reporter\nWould ask you a question about that decision uh so if you don't mind I wouldn't\nMind that at all no I wouldn't mind it at our well let me if I wouldn't make any difference to me All right go ahead I'm\nNow this is interesting for for a couple of reasons first off\nA\nMy guess is is that of Costa is is is trying to pander and act like he's the cool guy on one side of the me too movement and simultaneously taking a dig at Donald Trump who's been cast as anti me too movement\nAnd so he's trying to uh go off script and out of protocol right which is which is perfectly fine unless somebody like Trump does it and then you can't go off script to kick off protocol but he goes off it and then but the other part of this is\nDoesn't it sound pandering is if you know oh well you ask a female reporter is if it is Trump said uh what do you mean by that I mean if there's no evidence that Trump doesn't you know\nHe doesn't if you're a woman or a man after your right to you they're asking you get to ask a question out it's your job\nRight but now now he took his time and his ...\nIsn't that ... that would be condescending pan ... patronizing said you worked for ... for a job or get on that OK well caviar yeah yeah and so that that ... that's\nThat's one way that I that I look at it that's it that's the only thing that's interesting about that too is if you listen to that entire press conference that was the hour and twenty or so minutes big one on one interview he did at the United nations I think it was like on Wednesday and\nIt was Trump at his goofy is best or worse depending on which side you're on I mean he was rambling and riffing and going all over the place\nBut when that came out he snapped out of it and his half out of the second yeah\nI mean I I don't waiting for that I don't think you could have handled it much better if you're talking about again a one off the here's a guy tried to kick you in the groin next guy's defending a counter punching a kicking your back in the growing\n... that was I I don't know where the heck that came from when I heard that\nBut a second later his pompous and do it yeah but at this point what do you mean what do you mean what a great I mean that's that's a good one\nAnd the reason why of course nobody says anything and we brought it up again it gets knocked out because the expectation they didn't go the way I'm going to needle Donald Trump and he's going to go bananas and then we're going to play the ban is thing but he actually with a different way but the irony of it is right before that and then right after he was kind of going in this way\nYeah right and when he come down to do that my jaw hit the floor\nWell again that's a good good clipped yeah decent flipping this week and a lot of uh the here and when we come back a\nThat includes our changes our segment when we come back we will have a as we said multiple global media spotlight that we put together for folks are it is going to be I think eliminating for American audience especially the no

on voice to America\nThanks to the tune into the changes are segments and just a minute or they're just ended over many a spotlight on\nThe me too movement like in an elevator\nCabinet versus word lazy and what the world thinks not only about it but how they covered [noise]\nAgain depending on what you're consuming who you're talking to which type of a social media feeds your consumed by and not thinking critically you or maybe under the impression that the entire world\nHates Donald Trump and they're all like Jim Acosta tried to trip him up and do bad things to him\nBut of course like most things that's not the case there is plenty of evidence of that but there's also evidence that it's not just quite so simple uh Poland for instance is actively and publicly quoting Donald Trump to build a an added states military base\nAnd they're willing to throw a military deal they say they've got two billion dollars worth\nOf real estate that they're willing to give to the United states or at least to the United states and they wanted out only build a United States military base they want to call it for Trump [noise]\nAnd then of course this has a lot to do with Russia has a lot\nA lot to do with Russia has a lot to do what they do it has a lot to do with what Donald Trump and others have been doing it as a lot to do with migration has a lot to do with the institutional control [noise]\nThroughout your people like Merkel and people like me and people like work inside things like European Union European at heart or comes to talk [noise]\nToday I'm here with her who works with my trainer Carl Chanel of longevity personal training herb I understand you have quite the story\nTo those that are in power what is their alternate goal the wrote them a goal is just to stay in power I have raised this question for many many years and this is the next obvious question whether you're saying oh that that Jeff Flake he's an essay will be your own that Jeff Flake he's a savior at some point\nThe point is again when you're talking about or institutional control and people will slowly getting if they're slowly getting it the reason why our congresspeople in our senators and we're going up against the term elections I always step back and I asked the very basic question it's not a matter of oh I'm for this person or that person it's like\nWhat person in this day and age would aspire to be a professional politician\nThink about that why would you aspire to be a professional politician in this day and age and I would even say for at least the last ten years maybe even Twenty years why would you do it I mean it'd be no\nDifferent than saying I'm going to move to Damascus I'm gonna moved it live today I live in Chicago but I'm going to choose to moved it live I live in ah Newport Beach California but I'm\nChoosing to move to Baghdad why would you do that\n\nWell it's because you don't have a whole lot going on I mean our politicians robot and sold to the real power is behind them they're just puppets we all know that everybody knows he's campaign finance laws and who really pulls history I mean you don't even get to be\nA politician unless you've already cut all your deals and then you go out there and they control you'd that's for sure but the other question is why would you put yourself in that environment environment is so important that's why I say literally with us move it live I live in Newport Beach I'm going who ... even if you lived in Detroit\nYou know why would you want to move it ...\nBy all estimation is it's not a good place you want to hang out with full time I'm moving there and my family I'm going to go there it's like why would you want to put yourself in the swamp\nWe all know what it is every day the highest levels of cheating stealing in lying and manipulation of character assassination why would you do that\nSo it's nothing to aspire to oh we're doing it for the kids I'm going to go to Washington change the world than and by the time you and I hear that from the candidate they've already been rolled out they've already been bought off again that's propaganda that's a version of the truth but see nobody asked that question\nI mean only one that I Know that always that people get any like this first round like that person that this personal voted I always ask yourself why are you so excited about that is like asking somebody you know let's look I got a great piece of waterfront property in Damascus, Syria and you're looking at your going yeah it don't you step back first and say whoa whoa whoa whoa\nWhoa why are you even thinking about that just something you want to avoid so anybody that's moving there it's not because it's grade and it's not because they've got a lot going on business is going great or its paradise so I'm living the life why authentic life\nThere's something else going on there's something else going on we will starts in a\n\nI Believe it's in a clip from correct was started in England this is talk radio from London or Broadcasting Corporation about ah what happened in the hearings this past week and this is a to self proclaimed sex abuse victims talking about what happened to the United states\nAnd if there is no recollection a toll on one side shouldn't the burden of proof beyond the person who is\nYou say well okay this is not a this is not a court of

of the board and CEO you can't say that because you're a centrally by that statement especially if it's on true and that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was it was a secured had been promised to him\nOr any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private [noise]\nThat started this whole thing into okay and then of course the or some other things that he has gone on social media that question his ability to run the company but this is special because you're manipulating the stock price or the company\nUh it had a jump when he announced that the stock price at a jump\nBecause it was you know people investors if it were true might have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they drop the stock up\nBecause he would have

let us head back to a year we go to Mario in Florida Mario welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show\nWell thank you my my uh my thoughts on that or a judge Kavanaugh or that the old Bolshevik like Dianne Feinstein ... even at the Lowes they\nAre they're going to continue to attack him a even after he's confirmed as as a Supreme Court\nJustice I'm sure the ... and I have another question\nOr what but they they they made but it's not going to go anywhere and no one was like no one just once it's done I mean I I think the focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court this whole thing about threatening to impeach him that's not going to happen\nNo no that's not at the back of the things early there's nothing that's going to happen Rob the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario no doubt\nRight but I but I think a move I I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control\nI I say what you mean yeah the the lip service that's where the attack is the is it the lip service and I think that they'll continue the tax and that's\nWhat that's but that's that's the norm they call that Tuesday right they'll they'll they'll attack him when there is a Supreme Court decision that I don't like that when he was on her door to get in on something right on funny because Mario or a Gary and I were talking during the break\nAbout the the question by George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself\nFrom any case involving if he ceded any case involving\nA democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yes I think that would be the\n[laughter] well you know that I can I can make the case that\nIf you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same applies and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or\nOr or vice versa or I'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person in the case\n[laughter]\nYou should ... lives yourself because you couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defender's edge of your game you're not a person making the point you have no standing or one of the interesting Congress ... plays one of the interesting conversations or got\nGot an over the weekend with a with a few other people which was\nWell how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty what is it fifty three fifty four and genders uh the the that are out there\nAnd then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of why don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders and why they should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about for video\nFor video road dog here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow in the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nIdaho Montana and north and South Dakota so if you're traveling in and out of a I Ninety four in the region I twenty nine or Fifteen keep in mind this is the time of year\nAnd so everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector or the the suggestion of a law firm and everything that has gone and then you get to the point\nWhere they leak or name and you know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind ... as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed\nOur point is you're just learning that\nNow when I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole ... thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be or the politics has gotten so ugly\nBut on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically a nasty administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor he would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still ... because they if they believe in this to my approach\nIs never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left\nThey don't hail Joe Manchin is somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but he's not getting\nThem he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did all the media doesn't praise them no McCain did I mean apple McCain was littler after he ran for president right and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the way but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nBut I Do very good [noise] [noise] [noise]\nLike I say more bloody and broad investigation that sort of like to find out a little more about this stock the high school college\nOh heard have will oh you mean expand the investigation on her show I mean okay upset\nAbout this so hey this is this better just as bad as just shoot and Vegas they didn't have enough that it by ... and when I hear nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on an forward we just found out who she was of course you're going to know more about cabinet and you're going to know about forward but it's\nA it's it's coming out mhm\nMhm\nWell if there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember it's a background check\nSo the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far ... might not be\nWhat the FBI limits themself too and and discussing it with foreigners according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she it's still not yet been interview\nWell my question is you're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him\nYou start with Kavanaugh but then you're going to go into all these claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony you're likely going to go and and interview maybe even family members somebody who could back it up because what you're trying to do the idea\nIs to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background and you have to substantiate those claims\nSo there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of that can be interviewed during this process and that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her attorneys\nOr the guy I mean apparently are going to interview the guy from Gail who said no he he\nDrank Moreno ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you quantify it and how can you prove that that's that's the ... plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically this\nThis old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right so we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself in the amount that you drank you because I didn't want to buy it right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof\nRight\nHe hasn't been asked about that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury\nUnless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident ... and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk and your judgment nothing compared to somebody else's judgment thirty five years ago it would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that now that's not going to happen and they'll they'll see that\nThey will interview this person like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was by that person's claim can be corroborated not just with Dr Ford claims but what any other person related to the situation claims they are going to look to\nHave those claims backed up by somebody else\nMarty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio Hi Marty\nYes I'm a first time caller here and I think virtually from Daytona Beach but\nUh [noise] I ... I was a Trump volunteer for an entire year out for a\nCampaign and uh I've watched every rallied including the one that thrown in a way of West Virginia and there's thousands of people outside and you got people in fact I Am convinced that you're going to see some Democrats flipped a specially the one in a\nA West Virginia and even possibly a North Dakota as well and that even includes Donnelly a senator Donnelly out of Indiana I think that's where it's going to come from a a because the pressure is so great for reelection\nAnd running some great cat were running great candidates this year are in those three states a week and they pick up to the three yeah unless they get on the stick to start [laughter] ah\nAh caving themselves you know as supporting a cabinet off\nI yeah I don't know I mean if they didn't if I I don't think it's about getting Democrats I think it's about keeping the Republicans ah I didn't think earlier might have been they might have been able to get last week maybe some of the reports that were out you know again Tylenol had the report their source report it ended up not being right ... ah\nThat ah you know that they had a they had the votes that's my question if they had the votes why did they call for this right and well and here's my ... because\nRight after um flake came out others jumped on board saying yes they want the investigation too so it tells me that they went back into neutral territory there was word that came out\nA believe from donnelley's camp early on that he may not be in support on friday that he may not support the nomination I think it comes down to those four who were in that meeting\nA mansion Murkowski Collins and flick\nI think those were the ones are those are the ones to watch I wouldn't count on Heidi Heitkamp or ... in this case and I think I could have said said the same thing on friday at if if the whole like thing didn't happen I think I you probably could have said that on friday that on the broad vote\nYou are not going to get those those boats\nSo we'll see what happens later this week but [laughter] it's frankly politically speaking especially right now and especially with this situation friday is a long ways away and as\nYou want to get in we have a rare line open eight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much and they're recording the radio [noise]\n\nA part of the conversation by calling the shell wrote some a hotline at eight six six nine zero seven three three three nine red eye radio and shut will tell us what matters is inside and dance ski we of hungry\n... we have hundreds of black beard and specialized million Maya drivers white because if you like driving for a local trucking company with national power than we have a long term home for you Deb ski as a family of sixty globally runs flatbed and specialized companies in communities all across the usa and Canada\nWhere you can put down your roots you on short hauls or long hold on to drive our late model truck or your own trial do you like to drive ... research team\nAbout the challenge of specialized loads of been the desk ... family of companies are your million mile hole if this along with consisted miles great gay and top tier benefits sounds like what you're looking forward to go to Dr ... dot com and learn more about our family trucking companies find do flatbed specialized opportunity to be", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "01"}
