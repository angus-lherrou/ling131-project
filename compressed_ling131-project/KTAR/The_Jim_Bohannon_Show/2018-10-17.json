can buy [noise]\nAnd so we're trying to hire anybody but we're not having a hard time finding that even reliable have\nAn industry that as it usually is likely to hire and how can we gadgets hoping and praying certainly the one way that we can possibly find reliable and get people to be a part of the law and like I said oh\n\nYou don't know any painters that are good and a lot of people well we do know painters that are good I mean people ... at a party at there hadn't been reliable\nYou don't know any painters that are good and reliable people oh well we do know that they have their own it as well mhm\nSo the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own businesses\n[noise] ... yeah [noise] okay and where we're trying like me but um that I have black and like nobody's responding to it and so I don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the turnout would rely on people run around with good reliable people yeah and\nThen most of the time do pushes run around with due to ... so usually when I'm looking good reliable people I look around other good reliable people now I could be that you look in some of the other trades and you know one ... that's a good person or a trim carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who do they know that's a great\nPainter that you could bring on to the job\nA part of the problem a ... very very hot construction marketed in Denver and so every body's got work even do fishes\n\nAnd your has your husband's got my working hand or maintenance so that that you've got a bit of a labor shortage ah when you've got a construction but I'm always in the city and that's what you're facing a little bit of but the way I have found like you know and it is an apple in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world it might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that is a great Rubio and rails developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now in most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we go on like you've done websites you've gone Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers bright painters now where the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry that's a great person will no somebody's developer and send them our way and of course you're going to\nPay them and pay them well and\nI'm a ... paying a new push doesn't make them anything except the well paid ... so\nYou you want to pay people well but that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of extra people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people ah sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals\nSomeone already working here that was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want them to work here in another area\nNow we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbred ... thoroughbreds and donkeys run with

different fines I'm kind of confused of every three thousand dollars of my money\nHow much money was in there it wasn't that much actually with only around Eighteen thousand dollars\nFrom I'm not aware of a mutual fund that has a forfeiture fee\nThan looking at um it's a headless eight different names and then it says for fishers and it has a bunch of negative and it adds up to almost thirty one hundred dollars so yeah so I thought especially when it was only you know a small four one K. to begin with\nYou know really um did you roll it was a smart Mr pro\nI wrote it over and so ... previously on another IRA that I had already event\nSo you don't have an advisor I don't care I'm\nI Am sorry I Do not know the answer to your question of neurons that are the only thing I can guess is is that you bought a ... that your company your former company the mutual funds are high the mutual funds or some gun\nThat have got some kind of gotcha and they're obviously okay but I don't know what they are go ahead and get in touch with one of the more of us are pros and your area and just see if they will answer that question for you okay maybe they can tell you exactly what happened at least you'll have the mystery solved diver injuries too stupid to answer the questions I just don't know the answer\nThough I just don't ...

I'm hoping that maybe you can kind of helped me job\nUm they introduced to any high deductible a program with and I just say which they will be contributing to and I'm trying to decide should I keep my traditional the a plan or should I jump on board but this high deductible plan on\nHow much is a premium on the ...\nThe premium only eighty to ... pay period they calculate to about Twenty one hundred a year\nAnd what about the other one\nThe other one will be around thirty four hundred a year\nOkay thirty for hundreds of Twenty one hundred Thirteen hundred dollar spread yeah occur and how much is the doctor will only\nThat okay so on the PBS show it will be four hundred per individual or the ... and for the high deductible it's Thirteen fifty per individual but there is a twenty seven hundred for the family\nYou know and how how uh how old are your kids\nMy kids are ten and Thirteen are there any um ongoing illnesses\nOr by the doctor how often do well I'll say like why am I right now we just hit that adoptable at one of our family members were just about ... years I'd say it's\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your surfing hundreds savings versus the risk taking\nWere fairly healthy we don't usually run through the double so the hottest part of a lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it\n\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide\nMy hero yeah how do you do that what do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you gotta start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um\nAnd small steps add up to a giant staff at the end you know\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them that ties in um was really court I mean where when we started I used to routinely saying click while we're driving in church like boys what we're give what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that\nI'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away as we've learned how to Liz\nHave joy within our means and once you hit that point it's um\nIt just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nYou know so you have a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage approximately when you started this and um it didn't seem real that would ever get paid off somewhere along the line you looked up and said\nAll this is going to work and they started like you were writing downhill onset of climbing up you know what I'm Talking to them to pinpoint you remember where that was in the mortgage balances like when you got it down to fifty or you go down to a hundred or when was that you went at gun we're really doing this\nI think it was last year I I went back to work for one year and it all of my income went towards the mortgage because it was about fifty fifty thousand laps and we just just piled on every month it was like you just kept counting down month by month we're going to make it and it was\nIt was off it'd be you wouldn't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculated knew it was just for a year now they're talking to this year we're done\nBy them so I'm In for a year yeah and you can embrace a year of pain so by then you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe that yeah I I mean we were underwater on our mortgage for about three four years for me it was like when we\nUh oh it as much as what the equity was um then it's like started feeling you know we couldn't breathe and and now at least we can sell it and get out of around right on okay All right and good very good\nThis is good stuff you guys

against ah the Soviet Union work against the Soviet Union\nAnd they didn't really much care what they did during the war in addition there was an organization set up by Heinrich ... the head of the ss one of the most viable human beings ever walked the planet\nCalled Odessa and him we knew about a year a before the third Reich collapse of Germany was going to lose and him with he can negotiate a separate pieces kind of crazy delusional stuff\nFrom him but he formed an organization and they had a lot of money and a lot of assassins within the organization and so they helped these guys get out of Germany we have a you know we tell you step by step how that happened\nAnd also the America not the American Red Cross in in Switzerland helped them a elements of the Vatican helped them and they got\nThem from Germany down to general Italy and on boats to Spain and South America and South Africa ah it it was an amazing assembly line to get these guys out we took a big guys and we took it I meant andme Angola Klaus Barbie the Bush early on and Martin Mormon\nWho the myth was died in Berlin as a as Hitler committed suicide well he didn't he got away to South America and we kind of we proved that in the book by dental work and so it was a compelling compelling a story almost on every page\nUm and I want Americans particularly younger Americans to understand the evil that was in play you know Jim these ss people I mean they were farmers and bankers and merchants they didn't go to hell university\nWhen World War two broke out they just signed up and put on a black uniform with the death said just go on a cap\nAnd we're in we're in a concentration camps where they could kill millions of people\nWho just ordinary people is just amazing\nI'm ... and when you read it people to all that couldn't happen yeah it did it and it could happen here by the way\nA will certainly return to that thought here in a moment that it could happen here and by the way I happen to agree with you but I'm sure many out there are a race out the thought of that I certainly understand the motivation\nBut I have to ask in retrospect since we now have a three quarters of a century since World War two certainly time to weigh whether this was even remotely worth it is there any kind of justification\nFor whatever intelligence these people may have revealed to justify what this country and others the Vatican and others did in in a sparing these people and spirited him away is there any justification at all\nNo\nBut it's another case of people looking away from evil that is what Harry Truman did ill in killing the ss we show you how Harry Truman almost had to be black male to go after\nAdolf Eichmann the they had to say if you don't Mr President we're going to lead to the press that you're not going to go after I\nWho who did that and then adding that forced force Truman to do it who who who blackmail on it who blackmailed him\nI'm a element in the state department made it clear and we named the man I'm that I have two men didn't sign on the order for the CIA to look for a man that he was going to go public with it he was a judge\nOr an American judge who was at Nuremberg\nAnd it turned his stomach that the U.S government was looking the other way and didn't want to know or hear about the atrocities that happened in the concentration camps\nAnd an insult true that Harry Truman was a bad man he just didn't want to acknowledge it is the same thing in in in a FDR FDR knew that the Nazis were mowing down innocent people knew it\nBut he couldn't sell it or wouldn't sell it because half the public didn't want to get involved with World War two\nWon eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six lots of other revelations like this that are astounding and the bill O'Reilly will tell you all about them or just a a a a tidbit if you will some hors d'oeuvres for thought from his latest to the killings series\nKilling the ss and it is a a gang buster read to just published by the way by Henry Holt and company again our number one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six if you'd like to talk to bill about\nHis book killing the ss or any of the big issues of the day and of course we haven't even talked about the mid term elections which we will do was billed as

in customer satisfaction with windows and patio\nThere is anger but there's also you know let me give you an example Jim and this is a pretty vivid example of what I'm Talking about here with the rise of evil in this country after Kavanaugh is confirmed and the day that he was confirmed\nA writer for the call bear program put out a tweet that said okay well maybe he got the Supreme Court job but at least we ruined his life\nYeah okay that by the way the bill is done for it I think that's what he said\nRight I'm going to submit that no one on your staff\nAnd certainly no one of my staff at Bill O'Reilly dot com could ever put out a tweet like that and keep their job because it's hateful\nAnd it is an evil act and I'll tell you why because capital as children\nAnd he has a wife and a mother and father\nAnd this guy writing for cold there who's still working at cold there to no action against it ... ... is is applauding the fact that we ruined his life like that's a good thing and I think Americans have picking that up\nThe picking up that this progressive left movement and teeth are these people they're dangerous you know\nAnd and there's nothing in the world more tragic ironic\nThat people calling themselves and anti fascist who's tactics would be recognized by any member of the brown shirts the Nazi movement I mean to call themselves ... fascist is just tragic ironic and and sadly most of them would not even understand the irony\nYeah the good news is the good news is that there's not many of them\nThe the bad news is is that they're identical to the S. A. in Germany in the late twenties and thirties there were Hitler's bully boys who went out and beat up every body that oppose Nazi isn't\nIt's the same tactics yeah All right the same same thing but\nIn America you know a lot of these people and they apparently they all live in Portland, Oregon\nOh a lot of them do yeah yeah\nSo I take a quick break come back with more from Bill O'Reilly or get his new book killing the S.

Democrats' side because they Trump or pants I guess or someone is administration will allow that in the rules and speaking of ah who you'd like let's go and see who felt likes in Cleveland built your on with more\nPhil you're on with mark\nMark relieving the oh I Want to first of all sorts of ... refer some English said\nWhile ago about if a\nTrump or out in ... came vice president that the speaker of the house will become vice president and there's no way of words speaker of the house is second in line to the presidency ... early a\nDevice friends actually thirty he's thirty right after ... ... you may not have heard me I corrected that in the last hour just didn't want to get robbed him at the time I live near a\n... in which also would would would scare me a little bit if Nancy Pelosi was speaker of the house so that would really be a scary thing of what happened but uh you know we talk about the Democratic nominee\nYou know a Joe Biden did a\nCopy the speech of new Cannick a British\nThat uh yeah I imagine they plagiarized ... yeah I Believe in\nAlmost word for word there I'll tell you who I who I Would and I'm I'm a conservative but I Do I Would think would would be a good person to run on the Democrat side would be a\n\nNeed we lose and he's a former secretary the navy served on a Republican president and a ...\nWho is that we didn't we didn't catch you you you you got cut off who is that\nThe Jim Webb Jim when I was a former senator and he's a former U.S secretary of the navy and uh I just I I don't think he will have a chance a nameless chance last time that the Democratic party so\nMove away from men like him Sam Nunn was the former senator that I could have voted for looked at seriously as a presidential candidate even though I'm I'm I'm not a Democrat ... but he he wouldn't even be acceptable to the Democratic party but\nI Am someone I Would like ... ... he's he's a good man as\nHas good instincts and is able to work across the aisle sincerely and to do things he worked for a Republican president as sex during the night\nOf the people who announced could you pick one of them to sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nOh yeah I I'd love to have a ... who Bernie Sanders\nI think it would be a great how would enjoy that I went into a he was if he would let me talk and if he was listening [laughter] and then in the air and then and not you know not just a demagogue everything I I like him his personality I don't want you to me that he believes in but uh\nIt would be a ... call do you know what Lindsey Graham said about you know what Lindsey Graham said about Bernie Sanders a little I always have\nThese stores a Bernie Sanders got married in a Soviet Union and some people think he never came back\n[laughter] that's funny that is\nBut I thought you know I was like hey Philip thanks for your call appreciate it on your mark ... program\nThank you so much by by oh and here's someone's going to I think is going to ask me right away de in Las Vegas Iran with mark\n... yeah I think the one I Would want to have coffee with is a game that tide is now she ran for governor here in Las ... only two hundred votes so [noise] and she was a schoolteacher in the sense of a woman and I I really do think that\nIn the tide is could approve of all the dirty tricks and terrible things that Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations soon as this\nElection stuff is over because I'm sure she kisses appalled there's a lot of those cars that is just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know so yeah if I was going to have coffee was selling the Dina 'cause there's just no way in the world she could approve of any of these okay\n... well except for one thing the I appreciate your call didn't follow the rules the game boys you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut to the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president and say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I that's I think he's a head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye for right now you have your national forecast or video\nRoadblock whether highlights around the nation today\nI ... around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible and the central part of the state with re precipitation over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains\nInto the southern Rockies under persistent clouds and precept\nSanta Ana winds in Southern California over the next several days should gradually abate around the horn we've got New York city

he's got a mind and he's got a compassion for for the people of this country\nA ... he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I I I Would think that ideally he'd make a great pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break the ice posed to a you know I mean look at Trump chocolate sorority wise you chose a tense\nAs just beat the and it's it's great insurance ... behind you sew anything ever God Forbid goes dramatically raunchy cameras all you've got it you've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you\nWell you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge do for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your color and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to ... ah yeah we have time right you can in is that Hammond, Indiana\n[noise] yeah I wanted to or speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't win much real world or if you lose an election you out one or two choices you to leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nRight our moral reasons we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't\nViolate all remember on the set aside the ... the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office or think back to the Bush administration a lot of people both at the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern where the incoming administration prosecutes the leader of the leaders of the ... the former administration leader of the other party because our our politics have become too hostile\nAs it is we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical all through our are having a stable democracy that we have and rule of law\nIs only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because it you know a lot of people and the other side I think he shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what the what what what what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department did with a soft to trying to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she may I mean that's a jar and\nHere's the Justice Department though but I but I I Will give you one ... my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam had committed treason obviously committed treason yet we did not try to lock them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back to get\nGood at that point can I you know I said you may not hurt me I said whoever talked me last night in quite said that ... that's when I was thinking\nOn this issue with Hillary a you made a good point at that that's a great point when the civil war I preach oh who could you have coffee with on the other side or ... when it probably\nI Would probably lead toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh yeah he's a bright guy\nYeah he's he's things things through good you did you pass the test did very well thanks so much\nHere I Am I Can't stay Tucker Carlson if you've ever watched than Fox News at these people answering questions in the news that's kinda dumb but it's interesting because\nWho'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along with people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking and respecting them let's go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on with mark\nWell you know I had a rude awakening this morning I uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard right is Joe and\nHas a dissertation on how I'm basically he can shoot somebody on faith\nSeven eleven and why you should be able to get away with it um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kind of signed on to the previous caller just right before me um if she really had broken the law and then found guilty then certainly she should be locked up um\nBut right just Joe\nThat sounded like a polluted twisted demonic rant\nAnd it when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country that had bars on the shores of this country to keep his nasty lazy hateful\nAncestors out of this country\nAnd I would like to have coffee and wait on on the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side ah\nNow that's a woman with some integrity and the character and strength ... and she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little spray with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so she showed that she's a she's a woman up strength\nAnd character and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the\nOld timers to just step aside a here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lot of people were liking ah his name as Conor Lamb and I really like for you you know what like for\nMore people like him the rise\nAnd I don't want to see Joe Biden run again um I think that he had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh it\nI I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but um you know some of these people just need to step out of the way\nAnd uh let a new crop of progressive uh come through\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line sending ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about ... times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the
