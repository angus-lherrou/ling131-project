I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply it by the hourly rate so it can fall thing so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks in our own than I can be I'll have no work for you know months on end\nUh you know oh I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be out you know or or you know months on end\nYeah but you're gonna make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nAll the ... that that even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the air [laughter] All right\nBut is there is some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in my position on 'em and they they saying that if that's about average um yeah OK yet but they they have some months where they they get a paycheck and\nYeah but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it what is your uh three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat the fifteenth outline\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get up to thirty or fifty\nYou know uh what what fighter position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role which you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're killing it the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going to allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me\nYeah so I idea to celebrate tonight my goodness don't oversee this I mean half of half of the ... love to be worked ... right now [laughter]\nI mean buddy this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this there's really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff AAA eight to five five two to five just as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city in for day to go to Rachel who's on line and Madison, Wisconsin right talking about\nHow campaigns like hockey nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right now I'm working in the legal industry I'm but I'm not a lawyer

who doesn't want somebody who can do that [laughter] pick the industry I mean think about how valuable you are and again I Want to remind you something Rachel I tell my audience this almost on a daily basis here's where we sit right now in two thousand eighty\nSeven million jobs available in the United states seven million it's historically there are more\nAlan two thousand eighty seven million jobs available in the United states seven million it's historically there are more jobs available then there are people who are unemployed and you just told me you're really great at systems and processes and you're really good at collaborating with other team members that's extremely valuable\nI Believe there are people listen to the show right now or go I Wish I could talk to Rachel I'd

more of your calls and the career\nA common theme around airs teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have to be intentional with every decision you make as an example if you're a business owner and needing to hire new team members don't waste\nI Need to get in proximity now the other thing I Want you to do is I Want you to start talking to your buddy other people acquaintances or who dabble or work full time in this space and I think you could probably come up with a list of those people as well\nAnd so you need to take them out to lunch or taking the coffee and you say hey listen this is the ... this is a place I Want to be in\nAnd so I'm here to pick your brain into areas number one what was your path what are some areas that I could get better and where can I grow up what do I need to learn who else do I need to ... do you have any relationships you know of any open jobs this is a very simple conversation it's going to yield something positive\nAnd says this is proximity and then even if there's not a fulltime job available because Nelson this is the this is the part that I Want people to get that are in your similar situation\nLet's say you do all of that and there's not a position that is right for you at the time\nIt doesn't mean you throw your hands in the air and take your ball and go home what it means is\nYou say All right I'm going to practice proximity in a in a non paid situation so I'm going to go volunteer or or I'm going to say can I just shadow you for a day I'm going to get in places where some type of audio video production is happening and when you get in those places you will continue to meet new people\nAnd those new people will help you get in the right places are going to open up doors for you so you're on the right track the first step is just talking to your body that's just the first step\nAnd that's how you ... practice proximity is people in places so again folks if you're in a similar situation let's apply Nelson situation to you\nHe needs to simply asked today and then start to ride it out find the answers when he goes and looks on line or wherever and he makes a list who are the people that are doing audio video production in my area\nWhere the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some in\nWhere are the places what companies are doing this and that's what he's looking to connect to it's not difficult it's going to take some intention alley and some ... that's all it takes\nTriple eight to five five two to five let's go to Joe who's on the line in Charlotte North Carolina Joe how can I help\nBut he can big fan big fan of the hallway the organization appreciate all you do thank you so I'm I'm looking at a I'm kind of continues you know what I'm Wondering if\nIf what I got as a hobby or district career so just a little bit of a back story or what a good paying job that excellent benefits kept their share that with my ... actually I take it a ... percent pay cut to to make the switch and and I went to the mayor of profession\nYou know I'm I'm quickly right in that I don't know if the right thing for me I think I might have jumped the gun and in fact if you\nWill tell me what the profession is that you just jumped to\nFinancial diving what is it a financial diving\nOkay so you jumped into financial devising specifically what are you doing day to day give me the quick rundown\nA day to day uh basically just knock out folk stores ... who I Am what I Do and you know trying to get them to be with me so that I can help them with a retirement plan in education\nSo are you working for a local firm or do you open up your own shop\nNo it's it's a it's a national um\nOkay so they're not providing any leads it's all on you to go out and knock on doors like you're doing\nExactly they provide zero lead okay\nWhy did you jump into that I mean I I think there's a question you may have jumped too soon because you didn't plan financially but your question was is this hobby level you know is this the right thing for me and and and I you know there's a little bit more to it than that I think I have a hunch on it but quickly why did you jump for this why financial\nPlanning\nSo you know the life of the day for the last ten years crowded and you know I always had a Ashley maybe that would help out with their finances and playing out retirement\nOr when I went to a fair every you know kind of told my story you know that you're given like a great and um you know just just you know trucks came across this I I went ... went with it and it's just that it's not working out\nWell did you plan financially from this\nAh

though you know I thought that's really no different go in you know kill it you know and and and ah you know I have no problem work on commission\nHave even al well here's the way here's the situation you went after\nA a financial advisor role that's what you went after because you want to sit down and help people with their finances with the problem is you signed up for a door to door sales job that that's what's going on and I don't know\nIf straight commission sales is the thing for you the reality is you need to get some feedback I mean today from your leaders are in maybe some some of your co workers to see why they think this isn't working pretty quickly you got to make a decision\nOn and so maybe it wasn't the right place maybe it's the right thing but maybe it's not the right place 'cause he's got the talent to give people advice and coaching [noise]\nUm and you have the desire to do it maybe you're just not in the right format the right setting to be able to do that so we

absolutely sure\nThat there were elites who were crafting that document people in New York people in Philadelphia maybe wealthy planners in Virginia\nWere conspiring against their interests\nBecause really when we talk about populism in the American tradition what we're talking about is grievance we're talking about a subset of the population\nThat feels like they have been cheated or that they

eight six six five oh five four six to six\nAlways the opposition to populism has tended to take and they lead his tone and certainly Chris firewall points that out of the very beginning of his book every man of king\nAs he writes was Andrew Jackson was beginning his second term as president and Eighteen thirty three the board at Harvard University he thought it would be appropriate to bestow upon him an honorary doctorate of laws now than the man he had beaten was a Harvard to allow them or they may John Quincy Adams and\nHis response to this as he was told a cousin and this is a quote that has reverberated through his great\nAs myself and affection a child of our alma mater I Would not be present to witness her disgrace in conferring her highest literary auditors above the

interesting sometimes\nSo it was George Washington's for Pete's sake so I was\nI was just about to say so and so's mind if I don't use spell check 'em but you know the the reality for John Quincy Adams\nThat the belief among the founders and it varied um but even with Jefferson uh who invasion Yom and farmer\nI'm reading the news under the shade of the tree is as he arrested from his plow hum and the the rule of the commenters but so even among the\n... were then the Republican Democrat um but even among the ... the the the more democratically minded of the day\nIt would have been hard to imagine that there would be a leader arise that would not be from the nobility from the from the ... right that you would not have the uh Presbyterian\nOr not an Anglican uh not a congregation less but that you would have somebody who was not from Virginia not from Massachusetts not to the manner born not to the merchant class not a planner but instead the frontiers but now Jackson was astonishingly successful in Tennessee\nHe made himself amazingly well the\nUh he was the governor of Florida he was a justice on the state Supreme Court\nOr he was the states for senator\nHe was a general uh for them in the black hawk wars\nHe did a uh he did a lot or not in the black hawk wars but in the uh ... uh the creek wore\nA he did all kinds of things he was he was a renaissance man and a lot of ways but he felt way outside especially as a Scots Irish meant he fell away outside of what the expectations of the founders would have been for the kind of guys for the kind of man who would have populated because the assumption was that there would be such a ... that\nThe natural human preference for\nUm excellence for elite is an for those things would have drawn men from the same

Jackson\nA earned the egg may uh and the infamy for his trail of tears and the Indian removal act this is how\nJackson you know it's it's interesting if you see yourself as a victim as Jackson did Jackson no matter how rich no matter how powerful no matter how strong he became no matter how successful he ultimately saw himself as a victim as an aggrieved party\nAnd the permission structure that grievance gives us is an interesting thing and it was very interesting which accent his heinous treatment\nOf Native Americans what he did he felt right in doing because he was doing it for his people

the ultimate political power\nWas about to the context in Nineteen thirty six I'm there were a lot of people who thought that the American system of government probably that the smaller Republicanism wasn't gonna work um that what was happening in Europe was maybe a better solution um the depression had proven intractable\nAnd you have national social national socialism in Germany or you have fascism in Italy and Spain\nYou have a strong argument being made here including in it with a bunch of American adherence people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh or Joe Kennedy and others who

thirty six I don't know\nUm he had a being Huey Long he had lied about it and he had talked about it and several different ways depending on who he was talking to 'em but whether or not he was going to challenge the threat that he could topple Huey Long and when\nAnd when and went on a platform or that he can topple Roosevelt and when and do so on a platform that basically called for repealing

FBI described the devices as potentially destructive and a law enforcement sources told the post\nThat the one first discovered in the mailbox outside the home of billionaire George Soros Monday had black powder on it but a source of brie briefed on that device and the one cent to CNN told the the New York post\nOn Wednesday that they couldn't actually blown up because neither was equipped with the blasting cap or other means detonated an explosive materials there was nothing to ignite it\nThere was nothing there are the source\nA set ...\nUh so you know I'm I'm I'm reading that as part of the reference that Andrew McCarthy used that said okay but we're wondering you know talking about the apparent bombers\nOr a objectives you know if they really were not bombs is huge objective then at that point purely political in order to make some type of political statement right and that's why the whole false flag issue has come up right\nYeah\nUm I I think that's something that we're likely will learn about in in the coming days if you think about the um the forensics behind such an investigation there's plenty of of physical evidence to work with so we'll we'll be looking at that and and as authorities are seem to be right now\nOf of physical evidence to work with so we'll we'll be looking at that and and as authorities\nAre seem to be right now focusing on for it as a possible place where these packages or at least some of these packages were mailed from then it's only a matter of time before they narrow that investigation down and at least have a description of not a full on identity or the person or persons responsible for mailing does\nI mean it it won't take it won't be long from there they're very good at what they do for video road log here is your forecast\nFinally breaking the rains for Texas high pressure remains clear skies today over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from I fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nAnd the good part of the mid west and south will see showers today most about Seventy five will look to see rain later in the day it'll be clear in the northeast the desert southwest and dry on the nation's midsection\nAnd western parts of the country with the exception of coastal Washington and Oregon and the Northern Rockies\nAnd six out of the seven said absolutely not I Wonder what they would say if you said what if Chelsea Clinton came in and ran\nYeah what'd you run or campaign to write whatever right\nOkay so ... did did bill and Hillary completely taint any possibility right Chelsea ever having a well career which is why she would only agree to do it if she would be appointed if somebody stepped down a retired and she was appointed to that position imagine she\nRan in twenty twenty imagine that she just sweat\nAnd I mean it was just an overwhelming victory and got her mom's standing in the background going what\nReally my husband my daughter on that [laughter] but not me\n[laughter] [laughter] ah [laughter]\nIt's okay you get to be first mom [laughter] ...\n[laughter] uh-huh\nYeah we'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies\nYeah\nOr is this a out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal lawyer excuse me Michael ... to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and\nGrassley said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the two sought to obstruct his panels investigation of the allegations of Kavanaugh\nQuote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley set in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\n\nThat would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\n\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly\nAt that that warrants that investigation I think\n\n... here's here's the question what if anything happens\nTo it after the midterm assuming like the house\nTakes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\n\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] would pursue a a a a refer I I I Would have\nTo look at everything the Grassley has but here's what he writes here in light of MIT sweat Nixon Mr ... own statements to the media information obtained from committee interview supper associates and publicly reported information about her and Mr ...\nIt has become apparent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims Grassley wrote him a letter grasses across does not guaranteed Justice Department will open an investigation\nIs the last part of that\nSon he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions enough yeah\nIs the last part of that\n... Senate he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher\nWray right because if the if the committee were to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen to them if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a\nA referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for\nProsecutorial means if you found that there was a wrong doing if you through the investigation your own investigation from\nI don't know everything that Grassley has yeah so I can so and I I can I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape ... right right right\nAnd then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on a national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\nSo it's not like you it's not like the uh the the the house\nAnd their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking to get you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or documents you have things in a sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised\nInterview that are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire\nTo pursue justice here well that this would be the Senate's I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that well again it goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law and if you go through the process and this this really focuses\nOn the the if the uh the\nTearing down and the shredding or the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process we know that that was the you know the the hearings what we're about Dr Ford but this work was ... at ... this was adding to a an intended to influence\nThe the outcome of the vote\nOn Kavanaugh the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire you know process while it was a separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process\nSo when you talk about doing doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute or shred the process that in the cell just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an about\nWell when we had the lead come out and say look this isn't a trial this isn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial and and there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is\nYour under oh mhm if you commit perjury mhm in you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury ... if you don't that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but as a political trial\nThat has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're ... going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence she has I don't know if anybody came forward after it I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out the crash had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes\nThat he can make that case for making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and or might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail\nSo should we said that when a political trial happens because that's what it was\nThat none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it if you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line\nShould you go after it I think the majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question\nAnd kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes\nBecause it is it was an attempt I think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that\nIs it is it was an attempt I think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do was disrupt the process and if you do that through false means\nA well giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process and if you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here\nWas to disrupt that process and you knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statement that were false I don't know why you wouldn't\nMove Fort well then what what did they take the house or not this is now in the department of justice which is under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a castle ... because it does it this really isn't at\nThis point isn't about political will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweat no or having any so you know my question on the on the house thing is that ... from the political will it's not about political will really\nEight six six Ninety red eye books with what I told him that he ... he wrote a
