notice you and I love a good spirited public conversation you know whether it be politics sports we enjoy a\nGood ... if we can have another radio show that wasn't really revolves around money in Korea we have a current event will be good\nSo she is a current survey yes All right now here's or at least set the scene as of June two thousand Eighteen according to the Federal Reserve\nIn America the consumer debt was three point eight seven trillion dollars oh that's a lot of debt or to the point that some Americans responded to a survey from my bank tracker\nAnd it's a small percentage but when you look at the total amount of Americans it's going to blow your mind and here are the basic freedoms here me when I say those folks basic freedoms that these people were willing to forgo if their debt would be wiped clean or reading I Can't really here we go [noise]\nTwo point four percent of Americans that's about six million Americans\nGet don't they present it so he like millions so that they again six million ... million Americans said\nThey would be willing to give up their freedom of speech if you took there [noise] [laughter]\nWe have a live studio audience in the lobby of a financial piece plaza Ramsey solutions real headquarters there shaking their head\nIlls that are really nice to be able yeah there is a guy out there with the Georgia had all I Know how you feel you know I get it okay freedom of speech meaning you can't say what you want to bring up ... like the guys like beyond for your breath okay\nHere's the deal Joe lunch pail will take away your debt you're sixty thousand dollars in debt the differences you can never express that opinion the rest of your life\nYou we we would be in ... what would happen to skin that got put on that I Know what would happen to me I think I Would ... like I I Would go to jail for that I liked it it may not be able to ... apparently they are not very opinionated people do but that's absurd ready for this\nLike I I Would go to jail for that anyways right at a mentally not be able to ... apparently they are not very opinionated people know but that's absurd ready for this\nThis is this takes the cake three point five million Americans Rachel cruise would go to jail stay would\nGive up all freedom not just speech vague would total along they would pull on the orange jumpsuit and go to jail they know it does it's not that detailed doesn't matter how ludicrous are we talking style you know go to Ralph oriental jail they would go to jail all\nThe way from your family you know not have the freedoms are you not suffering for ... for a family work and pay off debts you're just using that\nYou're just like use all freedom you're ... jail food yeah now let's let's break this down for a minute we're having fun with this\nBut but I I I Want you to jump in on this so these are people there's there's three point five million Americans were going I don't want to sacrifice cable TV on sacrifice going out and I thought of as a vice you sports I don't want to sacrifice my rent a couch unknown sacrifice my F. two fifty it's costing me seven hundred bucks a month\nOr I don't want to sacrifice that\nTo get out of debt today Ramsey ... plant I Want to go to jail I'll go to jail\nBefore that ... or ... or a three point five million dollars you have not heard of the baby sat there ... they just truly I've lost all hope that they will never ever ever ever got out of it\nYou just hit the point they walk out so they think I'll go to jail and then when I get out of jail I don't have any data\nThat cause they may I I Want to believe and my the glass as half full cut that there is London glass as half full up that's not right you know lots of have full I got to ask George again without an opinion what do you think about that in the lobby\nHe's like this he literally put his hands up and looked at this guy should I what I Want to believe in my optimistic view yes that three point five million Americans this is an optimistic but that they just don't know that they can sacrifice lifestyle you\nCan make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time and pay off that data is but the sad thing is that they had read like that they've just lost hope\nThey don't think you're ... you're exactly right I Hope that someone\nDoesn't say I would rather not I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable in jail\n[noise] no I don't think I mean I Know I think it's limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the foreign Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff but the reality is if you're joining show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that\nDesperate that your basic freedoms you would give up your basic for him we've got a plan\nIt's called Dave baby steps total money make over ... through it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcase every day on the show to their ...\nYeah well and on this show and the right to cruise shall we always had a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... you're listening to what you\nIt's it's everyday average American that's where it is people don't make crazy and ... they don't have like a Superman Cape like no these are every day people choosing something different in this room and that's it you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the power in it but again anyone out there you can do\nDrinks doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone number that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\nAny how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options on a registered nurse and I'm looking I going to grad school either nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school\nWe owe a hundred K. honor housework is free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and work full time through high school would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program and totality a but just prerequisites and and I could not work two to three years\nAnd the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a journeys make fifty one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there's advantages and disadvantages to [noise] um I ... I Would take away our name over right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step uh what do you call it the ...\nThe right nurse practitioner okay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nYeah a nurse practitioner okay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that tree or program enjoy fame prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years and you've got a no debt you may even pay your house off in that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are you\nTwenty nine\nYeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to cash for your way through that ultimate role\nI'm really know what are you making now [laughter] the\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically ... a year with that and how much does that scholastic and he said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand yeah correct you\nCould do it just started ... salary honestly and go and do that is forty can invest that but you're gonna make forty came back and a year so yeah Ken's right if you do that I Know ... and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do it and that other school right now like that 'cause you don't the cash for it they're not going to see them on that for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy or in a sense that you are an increase in income at least and yeah and then they've into the school and a few years and\n... yeah that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you're sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what\nEight years from now you're thirty seven [noise]\nYou can cash flow your way so I think it's both saying that's what I say because both of them are what you want to do both of them or something if you're good at\nArt folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day for him to show don't go anywhere [noise]\nAre you on of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raise a family and I have a lot of emotions tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts\nAnd they'll go through that and and try to figure out people in your area that are doing that and then even get connected like even some churches some places that will have\nPeople in the family that need this specific health that that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business you had that financial coach but it's totally doable and to make that money for\n... is our training on that route and I think you bring up a good\nPoint racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach mean Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that that's one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to do these got the heart of a teacher well that's a ... right so I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there are but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough\nYou're not being dishonest you're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five is the number and Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line and nodding home Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I can um I Am fifty five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years on and I just found in the last few years that on\nA typewriter or something like the back of last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it I mean yeah I can collect my retirement um it probably retire with a little bit of a penalty\nOn as opposed to going all thirty five years my only on five\nYes Hi retire with a little bit of a penalty on as opposed to going all thirty five years my only on\nA challenge or block is convincing my husband that's a good idea\nBecause it would be a bit of a difference here I was about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking on helping people find Hong Kong property and\nOn I find that really interesting\nOkay not what I Love my teaching them but it's just time for it\nI get I get good news I got good news for you and your husband okay\nSo for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time and I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not\nCalling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role of teacher before he retired without penalty\nFor five years\nOkay I just want to throw scenario but what if over the next five years you built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody who's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds to me rituals that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of ... but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income\nWhile still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I'd want you to consider Rachel\nBob and it's a it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how this when people aren't working so that means\nIt is nights than it is we get that thought what the busiest time and so\nTo say hey I'm going to commit for maybe ... you know housing and decide that a year two years three years old can even go to five years if you can\nWhatever it is that we're in commitment of time and if you start to the herself that while I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're in a crate residents of the major 'cause most people do great when they have great people skills but it sounds like you can really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic he's still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two maybe three years whatever your husband decide\nAh and then kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent here and do anything about it is it so commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many have you sell super fun versus going from where we're at the salary of the teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year he said about\nThat and I think once you show the hubby replaces the twenty five right I Want to give you one piece of advice do and followed by the fees just on the show he trained the top real estate special America Ryan Buffy be affected by and I find that comes

published by all points books subtitled the thrills chills screams with occasional blackouts of an extraordinary presidents I Love the prologue here what I should have learned it in your lead off with this quote major\nFantastic I watched it with President Obama two weeks ago he was not thrilled I'm sure I'll be more thrilled unquote the first words Donald Trump spoke to you know we're right yep please continue with what you you felt you should have learned\nSo ah what I wanted to do at the beginning of the book Jim boat is approach my audience from a posture humility because I don't think anyone who writes about American politics right now who comes across as\nA full blown do at all or at aspiring no at all it's going to have that core credibility that her audience can feel and touching relate to you have to understand and you have to communicate\nThat you're gonna miss things and even as someone who is professional inexperienced and been around the track is I certainly have been you can and do miss things and if you do you owe to you'll read or a sense of personal accountability\nSo that whole prologue is what I should have learned that I didn't learn or took me longer than in retrospect I think I should have taken me to learn\nSo with that sentiment that you just read and I don't want to give it all away but I'll give the listeners a sense I take that sentence apart a deconstructed almost word by word\nAnd say to the readers here with things that Donald Trump was telling me about himself and if I only taking the time to look at that sentence deconstructed and ask myself some basic that's super high level psychological analytical questions but just basic questions what is he trying to say what does he mean how's he coming at you\nWould have learned about eighty percent of what I came to know about Donald Trump after sixteen months on the campaign trail if I just paid closer attention to that very first sentence and one example of it\nMajor fantastic what is that about well it was a press conference before rally in Bertrand Michigan early August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago and it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate\nEarly August of twenty Fifteen so long long ago feels like a million years ago\nAnd it was the first big rally that Trump had after the first Republican debate and why did he say major fantastic because he noticed me in the pool of reporters covering his press conference before\nThe rally and I was the only network news correspondent in that group of reporters and the first one he'd ever seen at any of his press conferences so major fantastic wasn't about me it was about you're here\nYou're network corresponded I'm getting more important that's why it's fantastic that's Trump\nI should have learned a paid attention to what he was telling me what what that those two words actually mean and this sense as I say in the book\nOf adjunct evil exuberance that is part and parcel of the way Donald Trump thinks about the world talks about the world and views himself with in the world\nAdjunct evil exuberance all the time in every example and then I deconstruct the rest of the sense and I said to myself there were all sorts of these great\nClues that Donald Trump was essentially laying before me\nIf I had taken more time been more curious about this different kinds of political actor and there's different ways of dealing with language I'd I've learned a lot more and it would have taken me nearly so long as it did during the campaign just to sort of crack this lock\nWell with all due respect to you and all the other reporters now you've covered\nLet's see for presidency for three news outlets\nYeah let's face it this was an entirely new experience for any of you you just were not prepared for an eye on them up I mean let let's let's just your look at the at the circumstances of this man\nI I was wondering can you compare him not to any other president ... but not even any other governmental leader any other\nKey public figure that you've ever recovered can you compare him to anybody\nNo I Can't I mean he is one of a kind in the sense that he is this very large personality and as I write in the book\nHe was a fully formed celebrity before he got into politics politics has we've learned can make people into celebrities Ronald Reagan though in retrospect people think he was a big celebrity he was a B list movie actor he had some recognition for his General Electric\nUh sponsored radio editorials but he was not a fully formed big time celebrity Donald Trump was he was also a developer of real estate golf courses he had brand identity not just domestically but globally he checked a lot of different boxes\nAnd he was a completely different actor had different completely different instincts and orientation to the underlying rules of the game and\nI write early on in the book that there was a kind of school of rock improvisation if you love that movie as much as I Do Jack Black or that Trump brought to politics and I describe myself in the book is one of those fussy parents in that movie those uptight parents who want to\nUm school to be as it always was rigid following the rules everything by the book\nAnd Jack Black topples all that in the movie school of rock on behalf of rock and roll and music Donald Trump in his own ways toppled a lot of the rules and I was one of these fussy parents say don't you know the rules why don't you following the rules and\nWhy can't you a color but in the inside the lines I Know that sort of thing and it took me awhile to get out of that it took me awhile to get out of it and say you know what the lines are different he's drawing them\nAnd look at all these people lining up to see it this is a new experience and take it in\nYou know we're going to have to pause on that note I Want to come back when they look at how some other Republicans learn these lessons with major Garrett in a moment\nArizona's news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F.

being aggressive enough on counterterrorism I didn't think so either so I agree with Flynn nut you jump really had a hard time as president elect processing this bit of information and yet as the book unfolds and as we all remember\nThere was a very short and very turbulent time with Michael Flynn he was bad news and it didn't work out and in retrospect now President Trump looks back on that in the

not as if everything the FBI was working on suddenly stops and everyone\nLiterally goes in one's in this direction that's not how the agency operates these things work methodically across the agency

Saudi Arabia and the middle east in particular Jared ... dealing with the the crown prince and now that we of course had some later perspective on this chapter your daughter\nSo I'm One of the things that I Hope listeners gained from our conversation demos is that the answer to this question do we really need another Trump book which is not an unfair question and I would say in this sense we do why\nBecause we need a book about and that's the reason I wrote it and it was difficult to do while I was doing my day job don't take it wasn't a book about what's actually happened what decisions have been made what\nIf you want to call them this and the White House certainly does what series of accomplishments of occurred in the first Eighteen months and whether you think of them as accomplishments or not things did happen that are likely going to be with this country to five ten Twenty years from now one of the things that is with us is this dramatic shift\nCarried out by president elect Trump through the good offices of Jared Kushner his son in law during the transition\nTo start a relationship with the Saudi regime and\nFundamentally alter America's approach to\nThat kingdom in that geopolitical read region shift away from Iran shift away from the Iran nuclear deal and create a different access if you will in the region which is the United states surprisingly Israel and the Saudis to be a counterweight to Iran\nAnd so much of U.S policy in the middle east was predicated on that and has followed that track set in motion and I detail how during the transition by these early interactions if you want to think of this way or the two young princes Jared Kushner\nAnd the Trump Administration crown prince Mohammed bin some on the de facto leader and Arab parent in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their interactions and their trust in one another was foundational\nTo this emerging Rio orientation of the U.S relationship with Saudi Arabia\nA long time ago summer of last year\nWhen the White House was more inclined to cooperate on books like mind Jared and I had a long conversation about this which is on the record in my book you don't find very many on the record linked the conversations with Jared Kushner about anytime many topics almost none on this topic so if you're curious about how this all got started and what that perspective

but I Will know it when I see it because of political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were the only thing is they\nDidn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse right or were you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further ... more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said nah\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out

Know they don't need me to say it and they know they don't need me to say it and that's the great thing there is that um that that understanding and\nAnd the only thing I and I think I mean we might have discussed this before the the only thing that I think that you know were needed for\nIs the fact that there are busy doing their jobs they've got their jobs they've got their families\nAnd our job any of them were eating right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a

now\nAnd I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do\nWell that's you know makes me feel useful [laughter] I mean that's that's what we are I mean the the the

to move eastward\n\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration\nBecause they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders thing go\nWe've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and the earlier this week as well\nThey have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border they must be forced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question\nWhat level of border enforcement do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\n[noise] he said again I've argued elsewhere the parties should have been raised an immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat any form a democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we have said that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner and go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on this show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show\nThe first thing that we really discuss was a was a a a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy mhm\nWhich was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years of Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat with their plan be\nThinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration\nIt should be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said you make the accusation Democrats\nWide open borders and when they cry you our line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssued them the challenge and that's what it was shown a sane here that again they haven't had to answer that\nIssue than the challenge and that's what Douglass shown a saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't then they\nSome of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we and brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ... when you look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see the the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote\nDemocrat mhm\nNo the American people stand with the president on border enforcement they do he's winning that politically but the other side of it is is that\nThe Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want at all you know with the president wants\nYou know what the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them and backed them into a corner and and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically but rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll poll well we're going to poll aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nThat\nBut you need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way also we when we talk about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag\n... and all that and so people start question well why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that\nPoint no how can you have a discussion when only one side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keeps quiet on it well silence is your consent yes silences your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states\nSo why are you preaching that\nNow that stuck was shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are about to use Claire McCaskill's Vernor Vinge\nA isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person votes Democrat and they want border control sure in fact the constituency that votes most Democrat most the time\nActually to get out of illegal immigration in the legal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest they they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're\nBut they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level tell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that\nNancy Pelosi or they promoting that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe clear [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\nPolitical battle how can we ever how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party that promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another

down these people would not be a legitimate public expenditure this was a I mean it may be budgetary expense based on fear but it's a very reasonable fear\nWell after nine eleven they invented the

NATO\nThough I don't know how much of a quote unquote white job could could have coordinated\n... that's the thing that I think that you make a very telling point Dr Huber that that this would require have required very well organized whack jobs plural and they don't come they don't tend to come in well organized groups exactly\nYeah that that that that I think the the the the doctor but it's a very good point there that for this to deliver to the batter that it was would indicate that we were talking about more than just a whack job which is even more disturbing because I Will take it they
