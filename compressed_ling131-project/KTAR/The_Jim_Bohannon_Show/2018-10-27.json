Andy and Trish are in the lobby of Ramsey solutions just stopped\nBy cars that were in the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska [laughter] not really but thanks for coming by guys are you have an excellent absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\nThe camp will be a\nThe the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is all and we'll be rented or on\nWe currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on at a\nTime and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry law journal liability on your land or in case something happened with the rent or\nWhich happens to be your non profit and in the nonprofit you would sit down and talk\nAbout what kind of a\nYou know\nYou need to get with an insurance broker and what kind of insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about or that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the landlord or they could sell the time they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property or they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the nonprofit that\nCompany would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really ...\nI rent or can't insure\nThings that they don't own you don't have an ... interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit or how to keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land\nYou know you got mess on their hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings the business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying and so treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal and for instance I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay they don't sell it in mind but you wouldn't want\nBy there even if they did so huge that you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance and then they come back and tell you what how that ... ability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash what would happen in the same kind of thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs so much in this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it caused this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\nDoes it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the farm plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure and that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that\nYou know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want to ... do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but I'm\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot\nContract away liability\nOkay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you are liable for that uh you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had to sign a hall Varmus before you walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called ... those moves or risk management moves you're you're managing your risk but a whole harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts keeps honest people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employer you fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case to not have to write him a check but you need the backup in case you were to lose that\nUh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and\nI have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all find Brenda about how if you die you're not that they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that that makes sense to you hey thanks for the call and you're you're joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk\nYour life and your money and uh\nFive five two to five you

are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a question and I'm a new American I Apologize but this is something that you've touched on our website\nAnd find new to the baby step and I know that number one than the thousand dollar and mark and the fun mhm my question and you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm fungus funding and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an unstable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off\nHow much notice do they usually give him if he's laid off\nUm [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years owner never happened we really lucky we've never been laid off and let you go in and they get home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks she'd have a couple of weeks to do something ... going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so uh [noise]\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I was pushed pause on the whole told them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nArizona's news station Katie a our new ... family TA are dot com and streaming live on the Katie a our news

Chen has the latest\nWe have arrested seeds are say in connection with this investigation\nFifty six year old Caesar sat facing up to forty eight years in prison charged with at least five federal crime\nThese charges may a change or expand as the investigation proceeds\nInvestigators say it with a fingerprint found on one of the packages addressed the congresswoman Maxine Waters that led them to him\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different IDs mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThen investigators tail fast tracking him on a cell phone before making their arrest outside of an auto zone\nWaiting until he was in a public place to arrest him thereby avoiding the danger of confronting in on an address associated with him the ex pats had been unraveling sentence rats\nRevealing a dark history of at least nine Iraq including threats to blow up a Florida power company according to police reports he sent them a warning saying it would be worse than September eleventh\nSay I could also been making threats against high profile people in the media on his Twitter account mainly directed at CNN journalists\nEven with the south in custody investigators are stressing it does not mean to threaten its over\nToday's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages and transit now\nIn plantation Florida Natasha reporting\nAnd so we would like your thoughts about what we know and of course that would have to include some of what we do not know to like [noise]\nWe learned the arrest of a person with a very long history of the difficulties with the law is greed that again makes you wonder just what point do we stop saying you get another chance\nA clearly we're talking about someone who was incompetent to handle their own affairs and\nAgain the laws are what they are and nothing could change about the Caesar say Iraq but for others it could change one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six and a two elite in Inglewood Florida hell overly\nGood evening again you know it is being blamed for this but I agree with you a Trump rallies here take him out of here\nSo you're a fake Mr Trump you know he met these rallies take a lotta here have a lot of structure\nAh I don't know it's been like throughout the rest of the country to hear a Florida is angle is when we had a early elections\nThere's been no facilities here and there was no facilities before we've heard that this is going on\nIn even after the news broke that this was going on so access to facilities hill a gifted you would've thought that maybe the news media for us it's people's attention\nThat they come down here ... off for a little death it'd be interesting if anybody else's out throughout the country early elections what was happening in the early voting places that I tell you it is pretty nasty here\nBut when you say when you say pretty nasty there are some that you are you're talking about an actual polling places that right\nYeah so years you know you've got one side on one side and the other side on another side and you know one side trading at the other\nAnd talking about people who are effectively we're all but rather childish way campaigning at a polling sites most states have laws against actively campaigning within so many feet of a booming side\nYeah it's like a hundred feet but what was happening if it wasn't it was it's not only screaming at the other people that they were again\nBut it was it with a different party at the different parties were actually at one that's out there and in some cases the party for at one another so even when they heard that this is going on\nI think she gets paid and it'd be interesting is awful what happened in other places besides Florida I'd like to know because that's the way it was here\nYeah well again or I or are\nYou in other words you have it in the in Florida formal polling place was established in many other states you may vote absentee or you may go to let's say the uh\nThe office of a voter registration let's say and cast a ballot but I I don't see a lot of places that you actually have have a normal polling places like\nFire houses in in schools that are are are are opened up in this regard I Know that really because of course it's it's very hard to to protest outside of a of a mailbox you sit in an absentee ballot or or or don't protest in the offices of let's say a a ...\nOr the county office building so these are actual polling places huh well\nYes well like what they call it is early ... oh they need to focus his\nEarly election but then after a certain state they have to go to their kids ages ... to vote and of course you can see the absentee ballot but\nYou were just I Would say that one this story broke gets ... they're not knowing that that this is a process that ... I Believe that aired at thirtieth warning that wasn't there for like a fall out later that afternoon and said that if it is just occurred\nUh that I'm a stay at the same ... silly and the system is not war\nWell it is it is very unfortunate I was wondering you know do you have anything to to say in regard to the specific topic of the rest of the suspect in the the uh the only bombs tonight\nI think the thing that has always been I don't know if this is true is in other states\nIt seems clear alarming to me as black people in this state like Dan has had this ongoing arrests a record\nHigh I just can't help these people that had been arrested for twenty times he's been out on the street I guess that's the thing that for like ...\n[noise] uh yes it reflects as me as well of course obviously you can be arrested to many many many times ah\nAnd ah convictions or or what would matter in terms of ah of the uh what about ... prior restraint but uh see what you're saying that yes obviously something that needs to be done in the in this regard I Would thoroughly concur oh let it get goes in from Philadelphia tonight or good evening going\nTo do it on your mind to hire so I'm fine\nI'm a as a so I was I going to fall back on what you're saying where it's unfair laws and you know a person can only got so many chances but I was also looking at it from my most proactive and go where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nSo I was also looking at it from a more proactive angle where we have a problem with the healthcare system in this country\nEspecially compared to other developed countries and I think a field of mental health is even more under served in the medical field that are all and so maybe after somebody goes then so many times yeah they bought the information they put people on parole maybe they could have a thing\nWhere they uh put people on mental from Asia where they they go to a specialist mental health professional and they get help and maybe if\nThat kind of thing was more accessible and the first place that person would never get to the ways in their mind whether they justify doing these things\nAnd you know and I guess that it costs money mental health professionals are expensive that's one part of it but then we have things like that and how much money was spent by the FBI on this investigation\nThat the financial part of it and I'm from the other side as a mental health professional is able to help somebody and prevent that kind of thing from happening on the first place that just lifeless especially if the\nYou know especially somebody could do better building bombs and they I Would I say get lucky they get\nThose bombs or go undetected as something actually happens and people get hurt the answer to prevent something like that with a little bit of investment is definitely something I see is priceless\nWell wildly on buddy that I Would agree that is really to the extent that in fact we are able to be proactive obviously the uh the area of mental health is under served in this country we do not have mental health and science down to ... to do such that we can offer treatment and give but let's say a\nA Seventy percent chance that we've a fixture you're a defect the brain but a yes or the short answer is we do need more resources in terms of middle help and maybe some kind of a\nIf you will mental health probation might be at least something worth pursuing Greg in Sioux City Iowa on the jumbo having Joe on the arrest of a suspect in the uh\nSort of bombing case again since he has told authorities that they were never supposed to go off so what what trick combs things I don't know go ahead Greg\nYeah tell me that this is about as bad as believable as the ... this thing that has been and once they set up for this guy from day one\nThe whole thing is that is to try to ah bring Cynthia and support for the for the Democrat but older really hold there was one of the targets I could have believed this maybe six ... six years ago\nBut this is such a much BS it's unbelievable\nWhen I went over was granted he tended to pick a a has been or never was targets that's very true but there is a I I'm not sure about why when you say is set up I mean it sounds like the guy was set up\nJim Jim this one out okay how do you know he was at a quote set up and by whom and that's when I get\nMy oh my goodness who who worked at the CIA who does it does\nThere you're saying you're saying that you have knowledge that in fact the Democratic party establishment a hired to seize are saying look\nI Would not put it past that I Will not I would not\nWell okay so it's not a case of you know that at all it's the case of Asheville\nBut I I'm not going to believe anything at this point it is so phoney and it's so unbelievable that that you are like why don't we just put a like a a they asked me a day on the outside said bombing side it was so unbelievable from the get start that are of this whole thing and it's just that\nWell maybe a rational buys this maybe they would have made it more believable for you either do more to come one

five oh five or six to six\nWe're learning more about the type of devices which were delivered this past week to CNN two former presidents and others\nFBI Director Chris Wray of course has announced that arrest in the case then the other suspect as we know is fifty six year old Caesar say are the rest of the Florida charged with five different federal crimes that could add up to forty eight years in prison\nRe made it clear that the devices in the packages were real and dangerous\nThirteen IDs were sent to various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material that gives off heat and energy so a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nRe also awards that there could still be other such packages out there and there does anyone with information to contact the FBI again as we know the seas are say are has told the investigators that\nThe uh a device was would not have heard anyone and that he did not wish to hurt anyone whether or not he had anything else to say about why he went to all this trouble to do this is not clear a lead in Champaign, Illinois joins us on the jumbo headed Joe Lyndon good evening\nAnd uh and I could say a lot of things and I I credit when I first heard this today I just decided to let it sit there and not looking at for a while I was thinking about you know wait until\nSomething started falling into play but I I'm just going to pose that question and I can't answer this question actually 'cause I Can't see that other people could look at the at pictures of him at Trump rallies\nNumber one ... what are they like photo shop number one number killed a lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County and they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the places\nA lot of people have said he had this van in Broward County and they they said even if you're in if you're in Broward County in the places he even if you when they occur on a vehicle you're going to get the you're going to have your\nVehicle you know attacked scratched whatever it's going to be I mean people are going to go after it in that van let you know like it was you know not attacked or nothing was done to it and so I'm kind of interesting observation I\n... yeah there are pictures out there that the show him apparently at the at the Trump rallies although I Would agree that uh\nThat certainly this is the day and age with with bumper stickers virtually any kind a tend to get your uh your uh your car uh vandalize the you interviewed the ... says you're a member of the Rotary Club it would seem to this day and age of the big bucks to set up some people out there and the\nLiberal Broward County met vandalism car is covered when in 'em and stuff and all kinds of stuff in it it's just it's it's just curious and um there are a lot of curious thing about that if you look at it so I just thought that I just think about those things\nWell I think those reports the survey to do worse the worth considering ... thank you for sharing that with this one eight six six viable jumbo Stanley in Raleigh North Carolina a good evening Stanley\n... thank you for taking my call waiting or a question [noise] uh\nI have no doubt that uh I'm probably not as up to date on the stories you are do I have read as much from the secret service reports the FBI reports as\nBeen available or several times in the last Fifteen minutes you've made the comment that apparently this gentleman is not capable or was not capable of taking care of his own affairs\nNowhere have I read that he was not capable of taking care of his own affairs where where did you blame that from\nI get that from the all the various arrests that were made of this man and the various activities threatening to bomb a power plant at one point or other brushes with the law I mean it is abundantly clear to me whether or not you have a basis they're under the law for some kind of a\nOf a preventive activities or something else again but I'd say his uh his record speaks for itself\nOr certainly but there are many people uh that have been arrested who has a criminal histories that pay their bills are that are are able\nTo take care of them so they're not the fares are speaking of I I'm happy if he was able to pay his bills I'm Talking about on able to manage his own affairs without interfering with others let's put it that way okay\nOkay All right we've got that makes it clear I Do appreciate your time and great show as usual\n... thanks very much that we appreciate the one eight six six by boat jumbo when they'd six six five oh five four six to six or Scott calls them from Utica New York Good evening Scott\nI'm good evening Jim I'm I just wanted to say real quick I just wanted to chime in um you know first of all the Democrats and Republicans I'm there's an old saying you know there's enough of blame to go around and I think that that's a more or less true\nUm and uh you know I think that that guys like this or that if you go back in history to ... and a lot of different aspects of our daily chat line or that and the kids from Columbine and Charles Manson school shooters it seems an easier isolating people\nA dairy obsessed people that\nThat are are disenfranchised\nWill know when they say is that they called themselves disenfranchised was nothing about this man was disenfranchise\nWell I I\nWant I really mean is I think that what I'm trying to say is they feel as though they're not\nAnd the ... and anger and also you need to be noticed strike I mean this guy had a ... and ... like a circus wagon he's a rat's do we have the second hand sign that one other thing I just wanted to say really quickly is I remember\nA a you know like an arsonist that will set a fire and then stand there and watch the chaos that ensues are also\nA lot of the problem too is every time you hear about someone while they more or less in addition to the eight\nTime that they've been arrested for a DUI or\nThey have these criminals and they say while\nHe's got a very long wrap sheet and you wonder why they're still running around and one more quick point here I may\nI

excited voter who wants to go out and vote\nNow doesn't mean it's a positive excite but it can be an angry excitement and if so if you look at the big picture up there or the Democrats that hate Trump\nNow could they hate him any more\nThan they did or the\nDay before election day in twenty sixteen my answer would be yes because they did afterwards everything that went on for the you know the next year and a half\nDo they today is the is the anger\n... still there to motivate\nThe Democrats\nTo get out because remember there really is you know you want on talked about this this president is up I every president just unique and every Republican president we forget because people will say nobody has ever been attacked like Donald Trump\nBefore we forget that Bush was called the ... the only thing is a difference between a Bush and Donald Trump is Bush never fought back\nSo if you fight back then the rhetoric coming back and she was going to increase mhm but the rhetoric was still there was just as bad as her\nRoom ... rubber the protests started his ranch in Texas yeah in central Texas ... it was everything they were hanging I'm an effigy they read everything he was Hitler he was a ... and as Bill Maher said well\nYeah we called Bush and the and Romney and all those you know yeah we call them Hitler but they really weren't but ... and they just move on and then there will

that that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent we'll find out in two weeks but I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw\nI'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United and I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much a back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine so uh you know I I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time\nI Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United when they were more fractured than I'd seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people over Kavanaugh\nThat to me that to me still is the biggest unknown\nAs to how much it will drive Republicans to the\nPolls if it is what I think it is or what I suspect it could be if it actually is that I think the Republicans could hold the house\nIf it's not like I don't hold the ... right right yeah um and and again all the things that we've talked about the factors of you know what's going on in the Midwest and and what's going on with the you know if ... if that's affecting enough voters in the mid west\nOr to to turn some of those districts ah or to just keep people at home I don't even know that it will you know change your

[noise]\nI'm trying to I'm gonna I'm going to talk on this so innocent people and all that talk to you is\nYou don't get anywhere right\nBack them into a corner ... honestly forget about Jorge Ramos\n... nobody cares about him\nGo to Nancy Pelosi go to Chuck Schumer challenged the Democrats mhm make this an issue the last two weeks what do you want\nWhat's your what did you were trying what if you if if the house gets control and you're able to say uh what kind of a of a funding will go to border control um what would you support give us the type of border control do support right\nWhat's the border control that you support and be specific and if they just say we're for comprehensive now that's not an answer challenge them getting their fate what this comprehensive mean do you get get get it get it and I mean get in their face rhetorically\nGet the first thing what is the first thing the number one thing and that comprehensive plan right what does that look like the American people by and large want border control do you want to order control\nOr a ... Ramos does not want boredom at all but he's not a part of the government so it don't it don't even bother with him\nI don't care what a reporter thing right for ... forget about him he works for Univision go right to the Democrats mhm\nAnd say the Democrats keep talking about this or what would you do what you keep talking about comprehensive immigration reform look the thing that this has been going on for the last ... you know really since two thousand eight remember the protests that that that happened\nAnd still ten years have gone by instilled the Republicans have not challenged the Democrats\nTo back him into a corner to tell America what they actually want we know what they want do because all of the activists Jorge Ramos was attempting to influence and is a major influence in the Democratic party he wants open borders ship\nSo they want to open borders let the American make them be forced them into a corner where they even have to admit it or you've taken every argument away with the American public can clearly see that they want open borders\nSince it's brought up again and the caravan is coming towards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion stopped talking about everything else mhm\nStopped talking about things that don't matter\nCan bring this back right after Kevin ought to be the number\nYou can stop talking about everything else mhm\nStop talking about things that don't matter\nYou can bring this back right after cabin ought to be the number one issue again find out where the Democrats stand on an issue Mr President where the ... where the country stands behind you in a huge majority yeah use it to your advantage\n\nYep because at the end of it what you're going to see is that we need to have an open borders or this is what they want this is what they would promote\nIf they were talking honestly if they were going to be Robert rice speaking to ... Berkeley headed I'm not on health care but on border control they would say no people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it\nAnd this is the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say it at every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please say that over and over again and have\nThe media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left yeah\nYeah and and and this device I'd give the president as Mr President people already know what you think mhm forget about what have you with you ... writes everybody's asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around this what America needs to know is not what you think got a legal immigration or America thinks on illegal immigration you need to get an answer out to Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue or ... I mean what are lose the house into at least ... it's still going to be an issue take it to the Democrats mhm\nThey force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration\nYou better come clean you talked about and how many hundreds of times and the prices act you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the manger discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since early ... when William was that was that two thousand eight two thousand oh no no it was before ... it was two thousand gosh to know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board knows while we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios okay\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling a scam nasty um yes it was because it was two thousand eight\nIt was two thousand dollars it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here was one of our personnel and and then\nThen it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh\nHe was that the conservative a convention and and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that ah he realized that the rest of America was not on board with\n\nYeah uh and it fell short a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather each other on the air and that's what I say because I write back and ... again because out here I was\nSo low I remember going you know we saw on that and uh and I was so low dose and so the the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about and I almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance that it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now man\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... Kavanaugh [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote\nIt but but it's been over Thirteen Years that this has been a huge issue among huge issue is that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit\nThis is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit that they want open borders that's what they want and if they don't want it\nIn the party to admit that they want open borders that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\n\nAre you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want open borders we can come to any type of compromise if we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety right I\n[noise] ones over your goals eight six six months he wrote a bone wrote a review [noise]\n\nMemphis show listen anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day that it red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that threat I radio show dot com\nCovert electronics is rather than for the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink travel centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty nine LCD right think CB radio this limited edition right then CB", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "27"}
