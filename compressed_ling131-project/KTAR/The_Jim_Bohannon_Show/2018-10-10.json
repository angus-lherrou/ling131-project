to five five two to five\nJordan is in Indianapolis Hi Jordan welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nSo I the last week I completed my debt free during your by over forty years panel over eighty four thousand a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd uh well I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of said I'm going to accept them thinking about just talking the money but also investing to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight job for a job so I'm not sure you're going to say\nWell at the right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred show out of my salary try to say about twenty two twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nOkay a month correct for how long will\nDepend on the type of house of looking at twenty percent on a down payment on a hundred and fifty probably about at least ten months bare minimum that play around fifty percent of the height of the year should be able to get that it can include bonuses impacts your turn him such\nOkay well twelve months will be thirty thousand bucks\nAnd if you invested started thousand dollars which you don't have the day but if you were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars\nCorrect okay I'm now we don't have ... thirty thousand dollars so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested\nAnd so if you make ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars mhm okay and so if you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on a house or you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put down on a house doesn't matter much\nVolunteer at the point as a boy as years saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\n\nDuring this year Jordan\nJordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen hundred Jordan is the answer to our equation okay that makes sense\nThank you for joining of Solomon is with us from Atlanta Hi Solomon welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nAll day long story short ah I'm I'm a doctor graduated from medical school just finished residency and I have about three hundred and eighty thousand in student loans mainly all from a\nMedical school at ... I was planning to do or the public service loan forgiveness program no to pay it off however um bad then kind of fall too with my current in Wyoming\nI'm just trying to figure out the good way to to pay that off into so comfortably and weak on debt for youth is a financial burden\nOkay just for a future reference thirty thousand people have no applied for the a loan for the federal loan service forgive ... service forgiveness Ninety\nSix have been granted it out of thirty to out of thirty thousand it's a complete scam it's not happening the government is screwed you show good I'm Glad you're not signed up for that so what is your income please God told me it's large\nIt oh my combining I'm married so with my wife uh about two hundred and thirty\nGood [noise]\nOkay so you're gonna you're you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah you're going to live like a college student okay help you out and start buying crap\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap bought bought one thing is one what the cart what'd you buy\nA A R I got yeah yeah uh now do you know what'd you pay for it about fifty thousand okay\nYou're a three hundred and eighty thousand dollars in debt you can never do that again\nI don't plan to\nYou can never do anything like that again you're not going on vacation you're not buying a house you are a broke doctor\nHere's the thing you have this absolutely fabulous income and you are going to destroy your wealth building ability with that income if you don't clear this debt up and treat it like it's cancer and we're going to hit it with chemo and everything we got\nAnd show that I Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less which would make me debt free in under three years okay and then\nI Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for greater outcome we know that because you have gone to school your whole freaking life and you're very smart academically\nOr you wouldn't be where you are okay you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do it the other way but I'll tell you that\nYour colleagues are walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school debt for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease the only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and that's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor what goes on my broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going fifty thousand dollar vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess because if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt you're going to be so wealthy it's going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just screw around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you\nLori is with us in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nI have taken my call sure what's up\nI'm at this point where I could be giving 'em you can't fight now laughter and my mom has been ...\nAnd I moved here at the power of and she is very very small ram and have a large swath in there and I was wondering what that it could give in\nTo help get her ... her hair my path that ran and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue unless somebody giving 'em would it be tithing no but it would be giving yes um I don't ... I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but\nUm you have the money to do this or you baroque or what\nKnow I happen many pecan okay and you're you're out of debt yeah okay and you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred and how old are you having good very good okay what's your income\nAbout Ninety thousand cool you single or single and what are you talking about spending it will crack me up at five and a dollar a minute okay\nSo twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any debt you can keep investing show you retire with dignity and you can take care of yourself when you're in the exact same situation later right that's what I Want to ... where you don't put yourself exposed\nTo the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom\nSure no problem with that OK absolutely what do they\nWant to see the right thing and it ... like you said about giving the fact that funding to make sure I was going to write and how\nI think you are just wonderful gift and I get your current or her and you know what a wonderful\nYou know act of love torture mama and and and again you put yourself in a position you have the money to do that without bringing harm\nTo yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live and the gills like no one else was very very cool Tony is with us telling is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI Am well I can help I was\nCurious why you advocate a money market accounts large low you account for like a murky coupon\n'cause your emergency phone is not an investment it's insurance\nOkay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid\nBecause if you're transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it\nThe rate of return is irrelevant it's insurance the ... of the things that does make you money\nTo see what happens is people don't have emergency fund act accessible and they got to shut up in something where they get penalized if it comes out is not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do the bar owner four one K. long\nLike a four one K. low on the ... the cash it out worse yet\nAnd they create a mess because I got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was like what they got stuck because they're all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of Kurt creating it gets insurance insurance is ... is an expense\nMoney tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense 'cause it's sucks it's a horrible right of return\nIt could be invested in be making more\nBut in that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier\nBetween you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and this is insurance some good question though that that's the whole reasoning behind that thanks for calling him open phones at triple eight\nEight to five five two to five yeah when they find you know why because it's gone on\nIn your set or having an

a\nReasonably attributed to this uh this particular decision and the timing involved how important is this job in the the Trump Administration certainly has been a bully pulpit for a a lecturing the role of a number of things and are very candidly ad that uh I\nWould agree with every bit of electric drive her to date I mean it's high time that the world was told that the number of things on the Nikki Haley was quite effective in doing so your your thoughts\nHe said it ... it is pretty much a bully pulpit or you know especially in the shop in ... he relies so much other media perception I think especially in the Republican voters me Nikki Haley it's very very very odd especially along with it I mean\nSee along with it I mean pretty much the Republican women that I Know a white Mickey elites around and twenty twenty four I mean I'm personally someone who would vote for I think she's a great leader so she's very very popular and for that reason her position is very important uh whether or not physicians is important or will probably determine on who goes it\nAnd if they can do a good of a job you know driving the media narrative is Nikki Haley can and it's safe I work in close to the president like she has\nEven though they will disagree on some issues\n[noise] it ... that's an interesting part of the story right there back when the when Donald Trump was first running for the nomination a couple of years ago in South Carolina always has an early say so in that context of the governor Nikki Haley was not a Trump person at all I remember the outspoken only so\nNo neither were half the people in his cabinet\nWell that's true and that's where you can say about this man he hasn't exactly been one who was unwilling to embrace former foes\nHe makes these are the

would be an on again off again a partial embrace of neo conservatism I don't know\nWell I mean I think you could describe it that way I Would describe it another way which should be speak loudly and carry a much bigger stack\n'em you know I very much states that Trump but someone who is I'd say like the artist likes to call up people in his own way um and for and he's always laid back it up I feel like it except for a rare example is the type to really draw a line in the sand and generally not act on that\nUh which which was encouraging certainly a given the some of the uh the excessive

life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly um and and that\nIs something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember that the ... in in past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know why lightning isn't the number one whether killer ...\nBecause we convinced everybody to go out and the lightning right [laughter] okay yeah indoors it's lightning right but you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving and\nAnd we had over thirty people in the Carolinas\nDrowned because they decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there's a waterway that that water from\nThe Gulf of Mexico can move its way and and so whether in Appalachia cola or you are in Panama City\nOr you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry in the big band that you're looking at a storm surge that's going to be easily nine feet ...\nCould be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nSome ... for those of us who have never witnessed that first and I just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mention\nThat because you know we've seen in a recent video from the ... in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what I describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm living here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know are you right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the fact how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um\nAll the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is is is really an extension the northern extension of the north bay or or the grand lagoon\nThis entire area from the from the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach right I'm\nAn inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much and it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you see in the ... like ... turning the water on and watching your bathtub Phil and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last uh\nHour and a half to two hours or so\nThe bath tub still and so in the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it started close to it ... North Carolina uh picked up a storm surge a that was at least ten feet I'm there may have been a higher storm surge\nA further around the point um that that sticks out there of the Carolinas um but\nThis water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth you need to be able to get to a place\nThat's higher than the storm surge\nThat's a really simple as it gets and this water is moving\nAnd and so the water has motion it can erode stuff um and when I say it's moving it it's it's\nNormal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed and so you've got a certain amount of ah it's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension the water's going to slow that body\nThe slow that body down but it's still moving so I the the place that I recall and I drove through this area a couple of times um because it's just a beautiful ride in your editor ...\n... you know if you've done this have driven from East Point Appalachian coal a cute little town especially when you're coming across the bridge\nAnd they're looking at Appalachian coal abate down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise] um\nThen you notice is you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes wow yeah\nThat's that's that's you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in fact we stayed in one ah in in in Texas and the and the Galveston area over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you've seen these houses on these still\nUh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high but add another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nWell you've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structure and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure and wildlife got great point of the higher center of gravity and yes I Am that situation which becomes a very disruptive very easily on ... and so again on the timeline here we're looking for the eye to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that is going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north northeast uh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time [noise] um\nBut if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth and we could anticipate the St coming out a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now\nThey're getting rain right now ... has just had the light and rain and that in fact all of this is very light rain tropical rain starts off his little find drops in then increases from there [noise]\nUm there's a couple of thunderstorms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up the Pensacola Beach so this is the eye opener hey notice it's raining idiot real it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland and and how long do you expect that to be the case\nBy let's assume that it it comes to shore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for all right forty five miles inland ... is what you would be looking at her\nAnd forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out\nAnd it would take those wins back over to probably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to\nPanama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachia cola hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles from\nAll right so so they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachia cola and and possibly you know and the ... and an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "city": "Glendale", "day": "10"}
