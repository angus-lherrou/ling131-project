perspective than most likely you're going to hear especially if you're listening to us in the United states we're just about everything comes out of New York or Washington DC we are this is not something new we see caravans these border issues\nI Believe that there are no coincidence is in politics I think are just like well we're learning for instance out of Saudi Arabia and the Turkish constantly there where they're trying to claim that there were mistakes or incident you know good coincidences we had no idea or we're shocked shocked to hear all about this\nUh it goes on and on like this but there are no coincidence is a there are plenty of mistakes but there's a big difference between coincidence isn't mistakes\nAnd here we are before a midterm election uh trumps the number one campaign issue dating back two years ago when he began his run for president was the border was immigration was the wall\nAnd here we have conveniently in you heard what the Caesars comments on it that we've got to this uh this issue that suddenly is a great deal days before our mid term elections here uh\nI always liked to say besides asking questions of people outside and where the stories originating I always like to ask you and myself just common sense 'cause that's about all we've got left me our institutions are failing us\nAh we've got a doozy at our changes hard segment today low energy edition by the way of what I've been told is the title of it of a classic case where again\nYou will have what is alleged to be the gold standard of American corporate journalism\nWhere they are claiming moral outrage and moral superiority and then somebody doing real journalism and we'll explain it all coming up and about thirty five forty minutes you won't want them is this real explained very simply somebody coming along and doing real journalism completely up ends or this fallacy\nAnd all that this gold standard you know corporate owned a journalistic entity that you know try to take the moral high ground and claiming that there that you know these are real journals all their only what they're left with is is again willful ignorance\nOr incompetence I mean that's all you've got there's nothing left there's nothing there's no good choices and that doesn't they either want to limit age was the gold standard of journalists even eliminate you as the bronze standard of journalists\nThat's coming back to a Caesar hunter is no coincidence is in politics in this midterm election coming up\nThat's where we all we start in the common sense question is is\nYou know we know there's you know the migrant flow we know that people are constantly going on all across the border but you know why does this get attention it's just like to Sochi\nIn Saudi Arabia coming up but also in the program we're going to talk to a one of our journalist or voices from the middle east who knows a lot about being a journalist in repressive countries\nAnd you know we'll ask the question and discuss is it unusual that Saudi Arabia would detain arrest kill make disappear or a journalist or a critic he's like no of course not\nThe same thing with turkey a you know same thing with so many other countries then why is this case\nSuddenly are being told we're being told here in America that is the most important case in cars so jeeze the most important journalist out there\nOr you have to ask yourself that question too I mean if it's unusual then you make estate cycle it's unheard of and we've never heard about this a journalist goes disappearing\nA no no if it is there's plenty of evidence that that should be expected I have said many times on this program for instance\nThat the reason why you hear so many so few people out of Saudi Arabia on this program we'd had him but it's very rare and his upset in this case to get somebody actually living in the kingdom\nYour abs on this program we'd had him but it's very rare and is upset in this case to get somebody actually living in the kingdom\nThat we'll talk was not even a journalist not even a critic\nJust to come on a program like voice do America originating in the United states next to impossible it's like North Korea it's like how do you find somebody in North Korea that will come on this program to talk about their governmental issue they run they ... that tells you all you need to know we do with all the time\nYou were calling in there were emailing folks were texting people they just go radio silence and of course we know why\nYeah not for lack of effort I can assure you that that it's not like they haven't come on before\nThat's the real till till you know sometimes when I got tired of it we don't like your show doesn't matter you know these folks come on the program before but they even tell us it's difficult for me to do it I'm not comfortable talking this is not a good time this is the feedback I can tell you we get from people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd it shouldn't be a surprise\nAnd that that that your common sense to me that's kind of tells you what the heck is going on over there you know I don't need to listen to a government spokesman already Elizabeth NBS I don't listen to Trump try to spend me around and try to figure it out and it's the same thing with this migrant turban do I believe that five thousand migrants just originated in Honduras and decided\nOr conditions are so bad we're just going to march all the way up to uh Mexico today\nOf course there's organization\nThere's political motivation behind it\nAnd just like everything else you have to ask yourself where are you on the food chain [noise]\nI also think there's truth to the fact that people do want to come here and of course they do want for it because of economic hardships and because of political asylum or just flat out safety I Believe that's also true\nThe five thousand two weeks before election in the corporate media are all over the story and they're pushing the story it's just like the Sochi wider the corporate media push to search\nWhen journalists go disappearing all over the middle east all the time including in Saudi Arabia why this migrant you know how do they form why is it five thousand why are the media all on this those are the questions you should be asking because those are the questions that I certainly us and that's got to be our starting point\nAmerica where the world comes to talk [noise]\nI'm casting isn't affordable solution for driving revenue in creating brand awareness millions of people listened to by cattle and now you can be a part of the action if you want to elevate your current cats or just getting started\nTo cast press can help the pot pills or experienced ... characters who do all the hard work you can focus on connecting with your audience to contact friends work with small businesses global brand an entrepreneur is able to guide you every step of the way with the Clintons selection editing ... get looking and performance coaching\nThe United kingdom first and foremost is saying it's a we absolutely backed Donald Trump one hundred percent or so before we get to talking with Ricky keep in mind again the obvious questions what narrative has been fed to you and me okay what narrative comes publicly from New York and Washington DC or if you're listening and places like London for instance to\nThat narrative is is that Donald Trump is in bed with ... there's some type of secret deal that they've caught or\nThat they're just buddy buddy and that Donald Trump will do whatever he has to do to please ... ... and he hates NATO and he's trying to destroy the world and all the NATO members can't stand that many does nothing good for NATO those are all the narratives that have been a long established for the last two years\nYou have to ask yourself why would what would motivate Donald Trump to do this and we'll try to get to the bottom of this but does this look like a favorable deal to ... who's real a thorn in his eyes his pebble in his shoe is always been NATO\nNumber two how does it play with a narrative that Russia is fixed the election and Donald Trump is only in the White House instead of Hillary Clinton only because of ... and\nIt's just some type of reward is this the payback that so many folks uh that worked for the corporate media or work in Washington DC that are running in these midterms\nOr how does it fit into that narrative and then you have to ask yourself the following question to this is relatively fresh news and it's as we also know corporate media only deals with one story at a time and there's a reason for that and we've explained that the flood his own one at a time they can't cover multiple stories at a time\nAnd so they build like a reality TV script you know there's there's a payoff you invest in and you introduced these characters you introduced a narrative and then you push it push it and there's got to be a pay off they're not going to vacate the script halfway through because they haven't gotten their pay off yet\nSo this charade the corporate media for instance actually covers news is clearly a charade and we've talked about that long before Donald Trump came along and long before this idea of fake news came along as a matter of fact we still maintain and I think really the only ones\nTed Koppel we played a clip for a couple of weeks ago he seems to be on our side\nIdea of fake news came along as a matter of fact we still maintain and I think really the only ones\nTed Koppel we played a clip for a couple of weeks ago he seems to be on our side on this one too\nAnd I'm purely open that I'm wrong but first and foremost what motivates any corporate corporations money it's money some political agenda not favoritism I like this person I don't know what drives them is money and if their economic model is being threatened or squeezed or if it's thriving by doing reality TV\nCovering only one story at a time or not doing journalism but some form of entertainment and that's what they're going to do first and foremost because they got to make a buck\nAnd I still maintain so before we get in to Ricky\nKeep all of that in mind in in that if there's been this large investment that ...\nIs a is a you know the Donald Trump is the whole of lumber putting Donald Trump has nothing to upset blood or ... and he's only after destroying NATO how will this fit in the figure it out and I don't have all the answers but the point is on first blush you're looking at this and you're saying you know Russia has come out and they criticize it is a fake criticism\nYeah um\nWell you can decide Ricky Ellison as I said missile defense advocacy alliance he understands all these missile systems I chatted with them for the program and I asked him why with Donald Trump cancel this thirty year old treaty with ...\nBecause they've been violating that you know for the last probably Twenty years and it's uh been really a much more a drastic over the last two or three years where Russia is trying to assert more influence on Europe\nAnd so there's been some demonstrations that obviously a movement of those type of missiles that break the treaty and to call and glad that directly threatened or the European continent\nWhat types of missiles in layman's terms this this treaty address\n... any any missile over that range or over the air me it rained this is why we pulled out of the Persian when Reagan told the perjury twos out if you're with this is the start of this treaty not to have long range cruise missile long range ballistic missiles\nThat ah go beyond that range I think it's five hundred sure what the exact number is that was limited to Russia's now I'm deployed goes on in colon grab 'em and have demonstrated those capabilities in Syria\nThat go beyond those ranges or that or are we came to terms with with Ronald Reagan\nNow remember when Russia gave a very public almost an an advertisement or a public relations campaign about how they had these\nThese new missiles they were developing and they could travel around the world and he had these this cartoon or an animated drawing or those types of missiles that would be bound by this treaty\nThose are more strategic muscles and strategic capability to strike United States that go there they were not bound by that treaty well we're talking about is um the hyper sonic muscles are not included in this tree\nSo those are outside of the treaty this treaty does not allow I think again you have to get the numbers right but I think it's five hundred around five or ... or a thousand kilometers um max on that saw limits your ability to strike um beyond that range\nI'm so that it limits or the ability to have long range capability intermediate range capability in Europe to shock shark Moscow and for Moscow, Russia they'd be able to strike London parish ah except for those those countries we took all that out\nSo been broken that capability by average deployments of missiles and testing those same deployments in Syria that go beyond those ranges\nChina is not part of this treaty but Trump made a point just last night's publicly to say that China is part of the problem and that he is seeking a new deal not just with Russia on these types of missiles but also in China what does he mean what is he getting at\nAll because China did not sign with the IMF treaty\nThat the United states signs with Russia and Iran where they were a void that so they were able to do and deployed those ranges that were that Russia was in the United states we're not so they've developed and deployed that capability so he he would like\nTry to fall back into a you know a three way you know let's get everybody back in the loop and nobody's developed you know between whatever it is a thousand Guam and writers\nAnd the ... and the extra do one arrange capabilities which we have salt agreements or or lemonade agreements\nAnd uh the ... and the extra do you want to ranch capabilities which we have salt agreements or or lemonade agreements on those numbers so there's a gap there that China never was able was never was never agreed to so they're unlimited capability\nIs this off also tell you that the hyper sonic threat that China's going and the Russians are doing and we're starting to do\nIs not treaty a compliant at all and there's no treaty for that\nDo you think that this exiting of the the Russian deal is more about China than it is about Russia and Trump is trying to send a message to China\n[noise] no I don't think China's going to pay China doesn't have to pay attention China doesn't really care\nI think this is a a deal to get Russia back in the box and and get them so they're not as threatening to the European allies um as they are today and I think it's also you know for\nThe Europeans to start burden sharing some of the capability that will all need\nTo be able to put Russia back in the box it's all about status quo as you know the president wants to keep America great\nAnd America or the way it's been so that means we are the superpower and that means that we you know strictly it here to anybody that threatens that status so he's gonna he's going to fight that\nRussia Today says that Trump's actions and their words are it's a very dangerous stuff how do you interpret that Rickey [noise]\nI I think they're trying to back away from it but in the endgame here or going to win that because their economy can't afford\nTo to do what they're we're we're we're proposing is very similar to what happened in in the eighties with with Russian and Reagan\nSo we have a better economy we're going to be able to move out or move an out they can't compete with that they're going to have to come to terms now with some sort of negotiation\nTo stop us from our development and get back on their control so that they they can't they're they're not going to win on this and no shape or form I I\nAm going to break out on this treaty no way how does how does\nThis Trump's exiting this missile treaty and then having the Russian government say it's a very dangerous step and having a NATO members like the United kingdom for instance vigorously\nDefend Trump's exiting or how does this play with a very popular in common narrative here in the United states by much of our corporate media for instance and many of our politicians that Trump is somehow in cahoots with who and and if their buddy buddy\nAnd that doesn't mean that they were buddy buddy ... he wouldn't withdraw from Mr grant\nThis agreement is calling now Russia's violation\nConsistently over the years on this treaty and we are now forced to a different play and if you look at our documents and

mean [noise]\nSo\nMuch for joining under this edition of oyster America the radio program or you find out what the world thinks about you know issues that are important to him we hopscotch around the globe talked regular people just like you and me in the hot zones we hear their stories and then hopefully we can connect the dots busy first hour already making stops to cover\nThe coming to America another migrant caravan we talked a Caesar in Honduras also Trump exiting a thirty year old missile treaty a pact with Russia talked ... about that coming up this hour we go back into the middle east to talk about the very latest from ... we just get word got word from turkey the Tuesday is the big day that the rule out there\nA reality TV a style production on what they've uncovered you know everybody wants tapes\nYou know the question I have is able to Clinton got audiotape or they've got videotape or whatever they're going to come up with I mean the whole area of all of\nThis of course is is that the detailed and even just common sense we've had so many people on from turkey\nOr talking about the president wanted his his government of the power grab that's been going on over there or this is a country that regularly sensors shuts down there do the free press or any press jails journalists runs journalists out of the country and yet they're going to come in here and they're gonna\nThey're gonna tell us what's going on the problem now that we're in this tech world too\nIs that let's say they produce a tape isn't the first ... first thing that Saudi Arabia will do or its trolls or whoever they hired to do the counter intelligence they'll just saved that tape is made up because we know you can make up tapes\nAnd how you and I are going to really ever know goes back to one of the principles of this program that we always talked about we will never know we don't know what's going on in Saudi Arabia will never know what went on in that constantly we don't know what goes on in the White House\nIt's all just speculation so the best that we can do is try to get as much get decent information we can and then ultimately you just have to say All right I've done enough work on this this is what I Believe\nDoing just hash tag I Believe that's probably not good enough I mean you've got to actually do the work like we always say don't believe anything you here on this program we're the only media outlet that says that everybody else is saying we're like your family you can trust us and they show him you know sitting behind a desk and posing\nYou know all they doing wrong burgundy you know or hugging a legit listen or they walk down the street they tried to do a fake man on the street\nGo to Florida and\nIt's it's all actors and it's all of that business yeah we always say look\nHere what we have to say because the only thing makes us different is again we go to where the news is happening we talk to people to get a foreign view of America but don't stop there\nKeep working try to figure it out\nAnd then you know ultimately you've gotta you've gotta come up with your own own idea but anything that comes out of power structure their job is to keep you in the ignorance that that that's the first part\nMy parents for real [noise]\nUnless they share struggles\nWill always be [noise]\nJust a total change in the music there at the end yeah reality

because they were you know how to Harvard and all that you hire and that's how I got ya yeah everybody does that game and that's where he was referring to there and ... and then the final clip please\nThis isn't just about casual racism ... made me have faced discrimination neglected in violence for generations and Trump can say whatever he wants\nMocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get me\nOkay that that last ... proof she she doesn't get it\nWill just so ... so you you're supposed to be ignorant and your spouse she did\nShe say me now to you right she said oh yeah and as these below you because I mean again if you get to my age you heard this show or I mean you've heard all this ... minutes somebody's got the music behind it and she's pumping out a video and she's a senator he did\nThis with the IRA ... with Kim Jong il right with that too right so but she doesn't get it she doesn't get any she didn't any\nNative Americans in marginalized and blood right but you didn't make the case may be a good that's fine but when she's talking about the Tomahawk chops and every right they're not making fun of they're making fun of ... they're not they're

back to thirties or twenties uh you're the most vulnerable your ... ignorance\nYou're the most I have not because you're stupid but just because you're young\nAnd you're the youngest voting bloc right so does this I mean you say you're not fooled by but did you say most people in your generation would listen to this and it would help her case to people say you know what Trump is making fun of of

got our global media spotlight segments\nAnd this is where we take a look at how foreign media coverage stories about America or that are important to America we've also got our voice from the middle east is going to give us the very latest analysis on the ongoing saga of the now confirmed dead by all parties Saudi journalist and critic ...\nAnd we're going to hear how uh\nThe Saudi flip flops flying through the middle east and Donald Trump's role in all this and how he is handling this ongoing soggy if you're just tuning in Turkey has just announced that on Tuesday is going to\nUnveil the naked truth that's their turn the naked truth of what happened inside that consulates a two or three weeks ago\nSo this is going to be a full production or by all estimation and again the question that you have to ask I always say this too is is that when anything comes from the very top so inside turkey it's going to come as early on as the ones even announcing this is coming from the very top is only going to be a version of the truth\nUm you have to ask you have to make sure you you understand that in your piece together the very best that you possibly can to make your old but the decision but even if they have let's say videotape I Would wonder at this point if folks would say you know that's the smoking gun in this day and age of if you had a photo\nFive ten years ago people would've said well that's good enough for me\nA PIN audio tape but I think five or ten years ago most folks would say that's good enough for me if you're a videotape five ten years ago people would say oh that's good enough for me but with all this an artificial intelligence at all these apps now than what we know about technology and we know that we've identified years ago the great war is now between sovereign nations in these tech giants\nAnd we know out there that you can manufacture just about anything\nAnybody can do it\nWill video will be enough will audio be enough or photographs be enough\nAnd how convincing can it be and when you know those same tools are out there\nSo that anybody can counter program and he thinks are the Saudis for instance are saying look we know the turkey the church our enemy we know the ... with us they're causing lots of body blows on his right now\nThey are causing us a lot of pain right now but let's get ready because they're coming out on Tuesday and we've got to have our counter intelligence program out there we're going to flood all these you know what's a Facebook all of that and call it fake or disseminate our own narrative and confused be I mean that's what's out there right now\nAnd we do that so you wonder the value\nOf anybody in an official position these days\nVoice to America where the world comes to John [noise]\nArizona\n\nValleys only old news Morning Joe average illness morning is\nThe A R three at the\n[noise]\nAnd made it on that especially the autumn is extremely that did it at a A R and D\nDramas like the idea now what happened come visit to Saudi Arabia they died hundreds of billions of dollars worth of our so basically what happens if a only needed in usually it's given that it's nothing it's four feet so anyway\nIt's worth of our isn't so basically what happens if a all these deans usually it's given that it's nothing it's for free so in the un there he\nAngry with them that I met them and send men would be the next getting us out at ... ... is there anything you're getting as much ...\nNow what happened in the key here NBS has during the time he was in power has been has been proven to be extremely ... like to a shocking extent\nHe didn't touch that eight to ... is from Saudi edited yeah yeah\nThis family a dark weren't they part of his family can yeah yeah yeah yeah I\nHave his family members have been like very big business people weren't why what that is one of the when the U.S twenty five people in the word a while he'd been but I Love your on your Disney on your back and he like other things we've never heard of ... country\nA duck thing the prime minister of another country and if you're a matter of fact we spoke about that with an ... you know a little bit here and I've been on him and his prime minister have proven to be extremely extremely or reckless and I hate to do and it's scary extending ... hear them wind cannon\nBut now they are not but one thing curry or ... but one thing that it sounds like he has a shrewd Lee\nA more laid is this idea that he some young reformer with western values you know women can drive we love Hollywood we love Silicon Valley\nI mean this is directly aimed at the west and man it seemed to work when he was here recently and in the he literally got a treatment of the royal treatment in a way he's he's been shrewd also has a ...\n[noise] well I mean definitely he was treated like that oh yeah in a way and it's part of his marketing campaign you know the ... how did it it'd be a modernized Asian we practice I think everyone has been looking for in Saudi Arabia and the ... in the United states it's a great fit but this is\nThe marketing campaign what's happening politically under the stage is not really that much kosher [noise]\nAnd that's the key here\nSo a smokescreen you're saying in the ... I don't know what you mean like what's the is it is a serious about the reforms oh yeah yeah yeah very much so he is the it is about but it's also it's not a smoker and that guy that's\nNot a smoke screen but it doesn't mean that he's going to completely liberalize or reformed the country there are still the very archaic portions of Saudi Arabia like if there's somebody that is a journalist that doesn't like you you you'll Gillum and drop 'em up\nOh that's ... yeah this is not part of the night I think just the you know freedom of speech is nothing that you you were speaking about letting women drive and are having parties and the street and movies in movie theaters that's by the way that the freedom of speech infected ... now\nWhat about what hit that point yeah now now head back\nAnd cream you've talked to us on this program before about your difficult dealings I mean literally where your life was threatened by a by those including the government inside Egypt right now but it isn't that\nGot him like this was the most of them got the oath yup the Muslim Brotherhood on you know you were doing daily and very popular TV show based on a Cairo now in Saudi Arabia\nIf we're talking about today today ... is it I'm here in the United states people didn't know who are Jamal so she was a week two weeks ago now he's as popular as anybody in America\nIs this unusual in Saudi Arabia or the journalist go disappearing do they get killed or they get put in jail on a regular basis\nIt's extremely and not and you will it's very it was pointing to things like that happened but here's the thing usually no one would dare to go against Saudi or\nA royal family like it's very uncommon to find someone to start with that with Trump decides that do you ever watch that one I tell you yeah about what's happening but between Saudi Arabia and a Trump\nAnd now ... when he came in had these are India's on me I could eat that I'm not going to step back from friends\nAnd how many things had been again has been elected extremely likely now if Trump stuff's support than hearing all the rest of it is would be a guy you know the base dined on these things that struck me than some of the money he got up and that's what will happen\nNow what's happening is ... and the vices of the United states discovered that this guy can not be the king of Saudi Arabia at all but\nTo avoid\nHaving today and you know having to with from whatever agreement that it did it that's why they uh\nCould even do X Y they a man of sort of think it's gotten that lead to a less than ... you know pressure can be on TV because at this moment\nTrump can say something means just never been tested is covering it I'd still nice I've been following the academics we have but it's got me you know it's the Congress as the people who don't like whatever you're doing you're I'm pressure to do that so that's what's happening\nSo you think that if Trump is making that move that's a signal that MBBS will if not immediately eventually he'll be pushed out of the succession to become king\nYeah based on the cutting given we don't know it's like I'm shorter and they ask is doing his best not to change the week but based on the current events I'm quite sure that he would not be the next ...\nWhy is turkey show intent on this on on on exposing the story\nThere again so yeah they'd be a has since they've at the end it flamed relationship historically a these are two big countries that you have got to understand dark and now they have most of the ... or a president\nWho believes in the glory of the oil ultimate empire and they were the leaders of the audience is like a gun to their health and fitness I left a caliphate\nSo he believes this way and a Saudi Arabia going towards the holiest a flat make a monument Garber or if you go to Pedro every\nLots of countries in that he is doing and that might explain autism sensitivity between Saudi Arabia and Iran believes that they should be that people controlling the that\nIran's government has been almost silence on this is ... have you heard any comments from Iran\nNot much no Iran or hasn't said much about that but you\nKnow does that strike you as unusual that Iran would stay quiet on literally their arch enemy in the region\nAnd and I wouldn't say I knew it was with Iran is very smart and that but at the most leave it does not and I would imagine they are just picking that bad things in a way\nThat's great from Egypt with the perspective on the very latest on the Saudi journalist who was killed in Turkey and don't forget turkey says on Tuesday\nThey were going to unveil all the information from their investigation that they have now time for our global media spotlight\nHow foreign media coverage stories about America that are important to America certainly discussed education if you listen to European media in this case France corporate popular media France twenty four channel uh they certainly tie all of this right back to Donald Trump here's a portion of a program on voice to America\nAs seen from the New York times they don't be not only and you have a ... watching how to cooperate as\nThings that have been coming out of the ... when we had initially about those Fifteen\nAt people that are that way at the touch down in ... and then international news outlet didn't take long to be able to individually confound themselves who the people why so it's not to say that none of this story anything coughing so I thought that the picnic releasing evidence as surrounding that audio files we haven't had that at least publicly yet but\nI think part of this story we do know a train ... Saudis who they were and they arrived at the embassy in that time\nThe audio file or the Turkish foreign minister this Friday saying quoted by the Turkish media sank we didn't give the audio file to anybody but he didn't deny that it existed ...\nYeah the I mean the only information we have is that he was it was actually pay painting and in old you are sending for music he watched\nA some a day or two uh two or someone who's outside\nAnd taping it on on a\nOn the phone on or something you can a sink or your your your I watch to that information we get I don't know if it's confirmed but that

out of this said Davos in the desert summers there was supposed to take place next year including French\nIn the mail yeah he said he wouldn't go\nBut but you know I mean I've been reading uh the

I still believe that it wouldn't have back then because in Texas remembered twenty sixteen in the primary\nHe won the state he won Texas or he also won Iowa a book but\nMay be maybe could have been something where a Ted Cruz with the last two uh\nUh but but\nThere may be may be could have been something where a Ted Cruz were the last to a better or work\nOr back then and and again we don't make predictions would just look at the polls right now and and Ted Cruz has a fairly comfortable lead\nAnd is over fifty in the most recent polls and were what two weeks in a day out so something would have to happen between now and then change those polls not saying it couldn't\nThis is a bubble thought\n'cause that's what the Democrats have tried or just a bunch of basalt there oh Trump loves America we love America or\nWhat I mean I Love America to actually if you don't believe in the constitution you don't love America you may love the concept of what you as a group all think America should be\nBut you don't love America the way that it exists under the current constitution and the rules and regulations that we have you and I've talked about it when you talked about the fact now they're talking about well the president needs to remember the president's seat\nIs no longer effective or that needs to go yeah the the the electoral college needs to go to the Senate needs to go and what they don't understand what those are key words that you don't believe in individual liberty\nBecause we are not a direct democracy we are a constitutional republic and the reason we are is to protect the rights of the minority best to protect the individual rights and the rights of the minority exactly what they claim that they believe the Democrats claim that they they think about\nSo we look at all that and that's all part of loving America so when you hear when I say that I've always got responds that's above the thing that he loves American we don't know based on\nThe actual specifics of what the Democratic Party is promoting mhm were calling for which is anti constitutional mindset and an anti constitution well yeah and we can make that point and you and I've said for the longest time\nBut it's the left that doesn't believe in the first amendment oh for them yeah mhm but for others they don't and we have broken that down before they don't believe in the second amendment and now they don't believe in due process under the law when it's inconvenient for them there was not a presumption of innocence that mindset is wrong\nAnd we've talked about that you know the support of the judges when the judge has become activists judges\nAnd how that is on American and unconstitutional and how they promote that mhm and so the average person I think she's at and Trump is anything they look at ... and I look at Trump and you look at Trump is anything but an authoritarian and a fascist\nEven at times though his words we like it don't say that yeah I when you look at what he actually doesn't what he promotes in the long run it's all constitutional yes it's all part of the process that was\nPut in place hundreds of years ago\nI mean it it's but this is this is what we have to this is what it has to come down to it we're not going to win the Senate we need to get rid of it that we're not going to win the electoral college vote\nThan to really get rid of it we need to get rid of the constitution when it doesn't but it doesn't ... me when we don't win the White House we need to get rid of the president's that's anti American\nThat no it's not well what America you for ... it's not America where they don't like it was on the constitution if we don't have the form of government that we have that it's no longer America what do you believe in\nBesides the Fifth Amendment [laughter]\nBesides exactly [laughter] eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nBook read are ready to do with a record ...

more of your calls and comments coming up following the bottom of the hour up but I I thought it's important to\nBring that up because that's more of the the emotion of what drives an election and I and I don't think I don't think we should discount how important that is in this election that reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing\nA especially from a Republican Party that you'd think two years afterwards that he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the story that came out over the weekend that Beto O'Rourke a small little theater\nHe couldn't fill that and here in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out is was reported over the weekend that the real rock star even though we hate that term for politicians to begin with\nBut the real rock star still is Trump and why because there is an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nAnd that's what that's what it comes down to it also how the ...\nBeen to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing it\nAnd that's what that's what it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to how the left as having an\nAnd that type of threat that that poses if you think of the what happened during the capital confirmation process you know so that's that's what it comes down to what's the greater motivator on each side and will seat and a couple of weeks for video road logging here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing

storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know but oh wait a minute but ... and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right are you even look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe it was a Democrat said it at the time\nMhm\nYeah uh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing nothing we've ever seen\nA it in our lifetime or in modern times\nHas has been like this so to even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means\nA lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up and said that didn't happen with sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower right the cell tower case or the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they use the in their writings they used um\nThe prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is ... exactly that was the press and the right to use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believed they legislate\nWhich is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on traditionally what they would do not by what we want each and every day mhm mhm but what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings\nThat we should look ... you know conservatives and Republicans stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republicans keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ... I'm not voting for a conservative judge\nI'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to be each and every day understand\nThat their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting too is that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the ultimate vote on\nOn a Kavanaugh you know I made the point that even the liberal justices respect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at one judgment you can look at from SCOTUS\nWas recess appointments which was ... yeah against Obama against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear on what the process yes and so\nRespecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court\nExpecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe and\nYou know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're dissenting or majority opinion you can we can tear those apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that\nBut in terms of the process I think ah by and large I have seen them display consistently respect for the actual process and I can point to that one example but\nThere are others a recess appointments was that unanimous decision where ... you can't do that and and\nAnd that is that is the difference when the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect to process what is left because what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the President's Day do away with the electoral college\nDo away with parts of the constitution\nThat's what's left\nTo the point there is no process and we'll shout you down just to get our way which means we'll get control of your life\nYou better button it up north Dakota where
