I think a Home Depot credit\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're with us Chuck is on the line and it's our\nJob welcome to the day Ramsey show [laughter]\nHave thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife and I have a ... a about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you\nAnd all but we've only got about ... who knows how to do because we have our mortgage oil three rental property that we\nHave mortgages on and then it turned out here's we've had a little graduate high school he's in college we paying about half the tuition so he's taking out loans other half and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I've got a beginner baby step say but I just feel like I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nDoing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income\nAbout a hundred thousand okay\nChoking the two of you you and him a cash flow the school\nAnd stop the students\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these properties as we've been for the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound you\nKnow it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to hear Lex cheers\nWill ... maybe some four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and retirement five is kids college what you're doing or cash flowing in this case\nAnd a sixes payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage is yeah which is in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I think a lot of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a three maybe four month emergency fund and then\nAnd then and then I stopped taking out student loans\nAnd clear 'em out and then to the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the to sound like a rentals were tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn our house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a fifty as you said to Fifteen\nYeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five dollars and I write them a check like a year now and I was going to feel good about that much time as do I take out a low\nYeah that ... that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimum ...\nAnd take her college without that first once we got college without that\nThen we find money we throw it up at the probably go knock out little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about ... back in the oil and K. or not\nOh I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no says you get your emergency fund right\nYeah emergency fund is maybe step three and then by bishops forest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it up the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nTo actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then of course money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages batch is that so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skip a tree or two and three I guess technically\n... yeah yeah yeah and you have any skipped three to do\nSo yeah you're on our lawyers with your back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling him a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI'm In the it's an honor\nTo talk to you how can

that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than a is there\nAnyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is or a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere they kinda specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were

written plan a budget\nA void that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again a medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a\nYou know a single young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home a no shame in that game right now but a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life\nA chauffeur that's a cool thing uh but you know the basic stuff we talk about here saving for emergencies investing being generous avoiding that\nUm you know

Watertown South Dakota Hi Michelle how are you\nWill get a thank you for taking my call certainly how can I help\nUm well I just started to get program on August I'm I have currently pay down three thousand dollar that um that just got to actually that's the guy I was making like on a monthly payments\nOn right now I Need the fat on like that that will collect check out our dollars\nMhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlement from the male ... or less like I had a federal king hundred dollar bill that there are are\nThat made her take family hired for a friend of mine like telling little that thousands of dollars that works for getting mhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the highlights explaining it true\nThat is true that is not given us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays\nOr cash out what your household income\n[noise] um [noise] it it's very very ... about how about forty five thousand this year\nOkay so let's say let's say you're out and ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only costs you two hundred dollars\nRight okay so it's still a good deal but your yeah\nYour I have about two hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but at the end the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have in addition to that now if you had a large returning coming because you're over withholding\nWell in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question thank you for joining U.S Open\nPhones this hour as we talk

specific dollar amounts with every one or just share with each individual what will affect them\nUm\nAnnually would be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten until it\nOkay and they are not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know our wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties\nIt was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but\nI have a lot of wealth in the background\nAnd um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about\nBut then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility\nNot I will do we hit the lottery as for me in my house we sort of more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nSo they need to be emotionally maturity shelter with them and we do about once a year [noise]\nThis is what I Ramsey show\nTo all the small business owners out they're finally

to Japan to see a couple of our grandkids well by the way we have seven that's awesome yeah so uh uh uh\nFive years ago you call him and say come home was ...\nWhat were the next\nI don't know I'm going to guess at a period of time three to four months like\nThis marriage is just hanging on by a thread and you say okay but let's try this together and we're not we're not going to spend like what you're spending how how did that next three to four months it looked like from the from the I mean almost gone to we're going to turn and try their their had it had to be pretty bumpy\nYeah it was it was hard to trust her\nShe spent her whole life living this way with this chaos with money and in debt and\nAnd I did it take you to trust her\nIt probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nWell I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this\nI mean you really had to see that that go a little bit a glimpse of\nA low right now or is it grew yeah trust grew over time well\nIn that moment I got home from your class I was going through my doors ... trying to sell ...

[laughter]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents with a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other does one\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen there will being would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities\nFood and other bills

got right things that affected me uh by the time we got to Monday show the one thing that was sticking in my mind I thought to myself wow\nYou know what are they trying to sell us and our we buying it and\nWhat they were trying to sell us was um if you believe in due process if you believe in the presumption of innocence if you believe that an allegation alone\nUh especially on cooperated ... um allegations are\nAnd not only that but the witnesses they use [laughter] don't back you up if you don't buy into that completely the allegation and you believe in due process under the law you are a rapist enabler\nThat's what they were trying to sell the American people\nWill see in a few weeks whether\nA part of America bought into what they were selling the polls so far show that they have not\nThe other thing is we found out that the Democrats really don't have an issue\nYou will go into different races and they will talk about some of the issues out there but overall if you were to ask Americans what is the issue that the Democrats\nThat the Democrats are promoting what is the specific issue when you think about this election\nBy the way has that question asked in a poll\n\nWhich question would that be specifically about what is the one issue that's driving you to the polls what is the one of the major issues of this election season\nTrump fought office besides that what would it\nBe from that because that that wouldn't be an issue is that would just be purely political right in and it not ideology but just they dislike or hatred of Trump or you had Schumer here here's what's interesting\nIs a is Thirteen ah and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you're very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I ask them questions about their friends you know just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for them Twitter and Facebook not even on the right or not even but\nAlso how things are presented to them you don't want one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following weekend when she was at the house but what do you think of that and I said well I don't know\nShe goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah yeah she said I said that she goes I don't know why they did that and I said well why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\nAnd something that was already sad\nThat just won't observation again forget the fact that it's my granddaughter ... case was a ... or critical thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are but\nIs that next generation and we've seen it we've seen their studies that show well the ... the generation basically behind the the the college age or college graduates now is showing more critical thinking and and not that they would be conservative\nBut if they are assessing things for what they are instead of the fantasy that the left promotes are they the future of\nThe low we talked about drawing lumber who is the uh the uh uh a climate a professor that believes that yeah probably a a you know the greenhouse gases are causing global warming but I Believe that everything the left is doing is actually doing the opposite\nSide of the opposite effect right it's actually producing them and we've talked about this before but you just pointed out however ... ways that the rest of the world is doing the opposite when you when your solutions are making the problem worse but you're signing an agreement\nTo make it better mhm that's considered better than if you're actually don't sign the agreement to do things that will make it worse\nAnd you go out on your own and you do the things that will never want to get you cheaper energy and reduce greenhouse gases you're considered the devil right because you won't get along with the\nUh international community and sign an agreement all pretending to do something but if you actually do the things that you wish to do or you claim they're going to do you're actually going to do the opposite of what your original goal was well\nBecause we had a lot more valid and we've been talking about for a long time the scientific community should be having this discussion not to find who go ... going to win

C. P. average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell the ... and\nI guess historically can shift happened\nAh with with if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOr the recent polls that were done in that race uh the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point ...\nMy point is it's our cp has it as definitely blue\nMm\nOn my map it's still showing great it's just one great\n[laughter] I I sit there and get it when it just Web grey eye thanks to the staff at our sleep you for listening to read I read it was it for them a way of what happened that just when it just
