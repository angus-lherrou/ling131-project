B. S.\nOr who he is and what he really stands for nobody knows a whole lot about him but he's come to the United states and they were lined up for him in Silicon valley and they loved him in Hollywood and they loved them in Washington DC and they loved him in New York City and he's done this all over the world\nWhere you've got celebrities that are cozying up to him you've got the celebrity entrepreneur is that are lining up with him all the tech guys all the cool guys\nThe grandfather Lee guys you know like Richard Branson out of the United kingdom for instance I mean they're all trying to get a piece of the action because we do know that Saudi Arabia is a nation of course that is closely aligned with the United states and if you're closely aligned with the United states gives you tremendous clout there also an oil rich nation which gives you tremendous cloud\nThey're also politically influential throughout that region with their relationship with countries like Egypt or Iran\nFor Iran uh and uh they were involved in lots of wars and there is the oil and open\nAnd because all of this what we're seeing is is very curious and now we have a case that is rocking the world is is like the Brett Kavanaugh U.S Supreme court deal everybody is focused in on this story what happened to this man who is this man ...\nKind of didn't do much about it so I Want him thinking that this situation will really be it um store that breaks the camel's back and they would choose the\nCrown prince of Saudi edited it within like this would be if they're using that as they would push for more much\nUse and like some of their own businesses between south at it and\nLike it would be it just ... car yeah\nSelf NBS if this young prince whose whatever thirty thirty three years old and he's come to America like he's been all over the world and you know he got the royal treatment out here he went to Silicon Valley went to Hollywood he was in Washington everybody played nicer them that was just in the last year or so if he's now done politically because of\nThis if that's the case who's going to lose the future leader of Saudi Arabia\nWell that's happening now in the twenty ninth of this activity was the point\nWhen you haven't been to Atlanta what's happened is that they are they didn't have any of this is very important if they kept it tight seat in the throes of who would be the crown prince and how do they chose if there's something no one nice like them I mean even the conclave or the ... election\nThe conclave is kind of we know what's the closest behind them and how do they do it but\nThis ... system they sit together and the clothes are no any communication is no any procedure to all the ... and they just come come back and saying this is the contents\nOkay so how is it already so how serious is it for Saudi Arabia or they just able to easily so you know say look we tried this guy he he screwed up and now we're going to just try somebody else or is it more complicated than that\nOr I mean you're speaking about a ... because they love the royal family that chooses select the crown prince out yet if you if you don't have any say in\nThat wasn't mhm to go to elect they don't know they're just you know the ... that long ago that can that's all they do\nSo what happens to this reform program that MBBS has told the world about you know women can drive now are there are more liberal programs in in it for for the citizens of Saudi Arabia you know entertainment concerts this what happens to all of that that they've been promoting\n[noise] well that was his main one and only selling card writers and the peace with Israel can write off I mean everyone was excited\nWomen to drive a ... you know they have movies there a movie theater is no more I think our Schwarzenegger somewhat like baked American style was in a\nIn Saudi Arabia and this is like a big foreign back yet again the problem is how reckless he is doing that he just like doesn't care about I'm\nBeing the sequence says every older this is just like quite fast NO PLAN behind that you know his new organized isn't up to\nThe United states government not Donald Trump yet but the many people in Congress\nHave said we need to put sanctions just punishment on Saudi Arabia is the United states put sanctions on Saudi Arabia how do you think Saudi Arabia will respond\nWell they actually in this thing is that coverage on uh Arabic media much in Saudi Arabia is not covering covered the toilet they only get half of it and get is Saudi\nArabia is threatening if you if you know they have

... we will also talk about the return of the American citizen the pastor who has been jailed for the last several years like Andrew Brunson into Trump of course is politically talked about this and he's doing prayers with them at all of this\nUh what to do the Turks think about this what was the deal that finally sprung an American from prison\nSo we're going to find out from the streets of Istanbul both of these stories from the Turkish perspective that's coming up at about seven minutes you want to be with us for that um and don't forget at the top of the hour we will have our changes hard public service segment in this time of Trump into NBL and a\nA Brexit uh we are told by the crack staff of voice to America today's a change is hard will\nBe the fine line between juniors in ... and to that is coming up at the top of that were don't forget a questions comments criticisms what you've heard today from Kareem especially if you're listening as throughout the middle east I'd be curious to hear what you have to say\nAbout this ... and what the United States should do this all ... and some people are saying sanctions Donald Trump is saying I liked the business but there will be severe punishment\nIf a ... is actually dead everybody is jockeying for position this is going to be another one of these like Brett Kavanaugh stories on the international level everybody is going to try to stick their two cents in and try to position themselves politically because it is so big\nAnd it is a sustainable because of all the emotional ties in this uh as well as very serious issue

there when cars so do you is there if he was there I don't know\nYou know I don't plan on sitting down and talking to president heard want anytime soon I'm not going to get that kind of access neither are you most likely\nSo we're never really going to know what's going on just like we don't know what's going on in Syria we don't know are journalists here in the United\nStates for the most part around the world decided we're going to pass on this a war we're going to call ourselves war correspondents in St recovering wars but we're just not going to cover it it's like the firemen who says I Can't go into the burning building well you call yourself a fireman yeah I'm Still a fireman but I don't fight fires oh\nOkay great that's where we are\nBesides episodes you are also in Turkey this past week the American pastor Andrew Brunson whom everybody should know if they listen to this program maybe if you don't you still know about it to\nA there he has been jailed American side says this is a you know the this is like North Korea where they're just jailing Americans and using them as as as as Bates for political or\nA shenanigans a turkey says oh he's an intelligence officer\nA and somehow Trump managed to pull him out now of course Trump says there was no deal made there's no quid pro quo I'm highly skeptical of that but again it's a version of the truth is that is what I can go with right now we will start with brunch and then get into cars so Julie they'll use I chatted with him from the streets of Istanbul you'll hear a little bit of\nAmbient noise in the background ah but ah if you listen carefully don't be distracted turn of the volume on whatever device you're listening I chatted by asking OU's why he thought Brunson was finally released and returned to the United states\nThat was a lawyer in the United states and turkey turkey after all all the negotiations given [noise] now they decided to let him go [noise]\nWhat do you think the deal was I mean why do you what what do you think\nThe United states and turkey agreed upon for his release\n[noise] well a lot a lot of [noise] probably a good they are all the American media has well thanks shuttles regarding the the [noise] a little bit better in the ... circuit from now I think that was\nOkay so it was money\nYeah we know do we know really what Brunson was held for I mean is there any idea why turkey was putting him in jail or under house arrest what the deal really was with him\n[noise] well what I hear they want it to uh give up at the state's first place because all the you know such pastor living in thirty or out\nFor their first say such as the most well they are on at school are asking if the guy that was what I was about that\nBut I don't ... your the created their shirts or terrorist organizations and what does he has you know the age of all faiths that said turkey wanted to hold him and as you can see it could've older like a war and send them back to the call\nDoes it have anything to do the ... well yeah I mean that is so cheap still desperately needs that once you're United States that Google\nWell you'd have to send ... in order for us to see what's going on regarding him and tell me a little bit of this is talk is not having any of the nation because they are all almost kind of live so\nHow does it play where you are then if if the United states has a a religious person that's being held\nA in in in one country in this case turkey and they say we want him ... we want him in the United states and now that's how ... so ... back in the states and for the last couple of years president or to want us to the same thing we've got this guy is living in the United states that we want back in Turkey for two lagoon\nBut the United states won't return him and they haven't been able to get um does it look bad for her to want if when you look at it from that perspective you know man for man\nSaid that could be out just call because that to look and you couldn't fire ... brown they might have something to do it at all costs you get that you end up with a lot of times much more of an issue like corn on the wall [laughter] so I Will just say\nOkay let Brad Siegel that that that's all that good to be a ticket\nSo that's good to be taken back to Seattle types that I think that's the case\nWhere do you think the release of Brunson leaves the relations between turkey and the United states\nWell what I think the relationship with the pension wise to get a little bit ... by the army talks but they are going to be here\nHigh high tension it it it it's still not going to be as cool as it were but it can get better but just a little bit not that much because\nTrump is still say oh we didn't do any bark if we just wanted in Baghdad this is what the hat\nAnd thanks to the ... people who spend some effort straight guy I think is that a hours on today acting created a mentioning Donald Trump missing from the little slowly realistic that sets it up so everybody gets their parts of\nThe day that the relationship between trucks in the United states can get salt water but as I told you not that huge impact by expecting\nSo he was also in the past few days there was a story about a a Saudi national who's been living in the United states he's a journalist working for\nThe Washington Post and he was in your home town of Istanbul talking to you from EPA constantly the Saudi Arabia and the whole world now knows and the whole world is talking about\nThis uh your government turkey says that this this man went into the Saudi conflict and was murdered inside there and and they've got death of this is your government offered proof publicly to say look we know this is what happened\nWell what I what I see is Turkish government reacted to the situation at all uh they said this is unacceptable and we'll look pretty cool it's as big as deep as\nThe guy goes against what I\nWell above what I what I get the feeling is\nAll the media in Turkish media reported all over the video footage as if they had they had access to federal grants to secure the a ... they don't they don't have such access so what I think you know what I feel\nSome part of the farmers are let's say governmental body or somebody uh just served the flow to adjust to\nDo you have a given you create an image of Saudi Arabia I think he was he got back to the states this is what I think but I'm not sure and ABC was murdered or not but obviously thought the Iraqi state\nI Want to make sure I understand you correctly you think he may have been kidnapped and sent back to the United states\nOr are they not United States to the back to the Saudi\nSaudi Arabia okay so back to Saudi Arabia and he's he's just being held there and nobody knows well the only only those people in Saudi Arabia know where he is and that's why everybody saying he's disappeared\nExactly and so there are many console cars how to be a conduit of general\nI'm living in a couple of hours of this is a journalist a reported missing and then those are tons of uh guys or see at the airport truly in a private jet so you know it gives you an idea\nWhy do you think early on in his government are making sure that the whole world knows what they believe about this\nFisher thing I mean I don't know what it is exactly but over here to stay somebody is giving somebody a message because you don't see if I stay at cause of it is one guy is getting lost in the little general it's issues but once it carries and\nEverybody knows without circuits serving older you get older and I'm thinking of actually until that say everybody knows about this how come it's hosted should I be picked it up or I should do they want the literally kill him and ... our happy as they can be and things like that that\nIs their truth to the to the story that a hustle gee the Saudi in Istanbul was there because he wants to marry a woman who is a Turkish citizen and he was trying to get the proper paperwork so that he could get married you know if that's true or not and\nI'm not sure about that um\nDoes anybody know about this this this Turkish woman that is apparently his fiance is is that do we know who this woman is is really a woman who was Turkish and wants to marry him\n... yes it's correct that as far as the um\nYeah yeah and actually he's the one report and of course yeah\nOkay ... ... how would you describe the relationship between the governments of Saudi Arabia in Turkey\nThey used to the al ... is about religion why Ellie I'm I was little so the ... year oh dear Abby out there just

to cover two big stories paying for Donald Trump and the curious so gee case which is our lead story today if you've\nJust tuning in ah hopefully you'll listen to this entire a program you want to hear from our voices throughout the middle east including the streets of a turkey about this American resident working for the Washington Post Saudi national ... and the whole world is not reacting\nFrom celebrities to presidents to kings and their economic issues involved and all of this uh did this journalist and critic of the Saudi Government cause so gee literally get lured into a consulate in Istanbul and get killed\nThat's Turkey's government says Saudis are denying it Donald Trump's kind of on the fence saying well if it happens\nYou want to hear how the media in the middle east are covering this and what they think the United states knew beforehand and what they must do now if this is a story that interest you you want to hear that's coming up in a few minutes an update on the story we've been covering for you but again as a hugely underreported story in North America\nAre being America's longest war which is the af Pak or\nUh what is it going on Seventeen years now\nTrump and his crew are still meeting with the Taliban which of course again officially the Taliban were not supposed to meet with because they were a terrorist group but uh again what what uh labels me in this day and age that with these standards and\nAnd labels are we blow right through just about everything you know you go low we go high now everybody says well we do need to go low we are going to go lower the loan we're going to kick them even though we say we're going high\nA Trump is still meeting with the Taliban there was a meeting apparently within the last forty eight hours in Qatar where Taliban have long held the you know an office there so that these meetings could be held\nAnd of course everybody kinda you know they don't nowadays they don't deny that these meetings are occurring but they won't officially say and it's just a little charade that goes on and again uh you know our media again corporate owned media that are important only in\nThat they have massive distribution in one of the pillars of the voice of America program is a\nPopular media foreign public opinion public opinion forms public policy but if the popular media or choose to cover a story or not cover a story then the masses the lemmings the goats\nThey never get the information and so they can't be influenced and this is what's happening with our back\nBy the way when we hear from our people is is that Trump is put on the table\nThey one hundred percent pull out of us troops from the pack horse America's longest war\nWhich is certainly fine but\nWhich is certainly fine but you always have to ask the question what does the United states get in return for the longest war in which thousands died trillions of been spent [noise]\n\nHi I'm casting isn't affordable solution for

except telling the truth and informing the public opinion\nA salary you document human rights abuses for a living you have to distinguish between five some fiction between a credible reporting and conspiracy theories [noise]\nA lot of people are saying how can we know for sure what happened inside of comfort in Istanbul given the prime source of information as the Turkish government which has its own issues with the Saudi Government which is full of having a great record when it comes to telling journalists to solve a record right\nUm well the the main reason that we can know one thing very concretely is that obviously we're not just relying on what the Turkish government has said ah we're relying on the testimony of his fiance whom I spoke with\nOn that day or on which demise disappeared into the consulate while she was still at the consulate\nA quick look at how old is your the CNN or the middle east cover the story about ... very interesting too when you notice that\nYou know that they're very skeptical right out of the gate of everything which is a pretty good place and then stating the obvious which we rarely hear from again state owned or certainly corporate owned media but we see we said all the time on on our program which is again\nYou know we will only know versions of the truth how many of you listening were inside that constantly right\nOr any time somebody in power says something you know it's a version of the truth is always remember that version of the truth\nSo hard because so many people you know ... what are we just go through in this country everybody says I Believe or I don't believe\nIn the middle ground is I Believe but I don't agree I mean think about ... we've been seeing this river just say look it's a version of the truth do we ever really know who's ever going to really know what happened ah with with Brett Kavanaugh and blogger for ... and Brett Kavanaugh will though\nYeah those are those people to you and I won't does result or are we believe same thing with the soldier we ever really going to go no the reason why it's important as as we have to start to start saying look it's not a matter of what you believe or not you have to start with a ... from the premise of we're never going to know and then the next premise should be those that are in power\nWant to make sure that we don't know and that's how you have to look at people in power\nWhen they're doling out their version of the truth understand it's a version of the truth you don't be mad at him it doesn't make them necessarily bad\nThey're in power that's the point you ask yourself where are you on the food chain\nYou tell your little children everything of course not you got power over them so you tell them you're listening to you don't need to ask any more questions just teachers your vegetables and then we'll we'll talk later right because you're a power and when you're the kid you'd get frustrated you want to act out\nWith your lower on the food chain there's not a whole lot you can do you can change your condition and move yourself up\nBut most folks don't want to do that type of work instead they want to act out like a five year old the tragedy is of course is that they're forty five years old or fifty five years old or thirty five years old and then it just becomes flat out embarrassing\nBut that's where more and more folks are these days they just act out they want to believe or they just want to act out because they feel like they've got nothing else to do it's like well what are you going to do about an act out wear pink cat\nWhat do you prove your love life that's another option but you know they don't want to do that because that's hard\nAnd that's what they're talking about with all of this if you listen to an al Jazeera had to say that's what they're talking about\nThe media again version of the truth we know what NBL came out and said I'm a reformer women are going to be able to drive and then of course you know people that's all they want to do is they just want to push an agenda they oh if\nIf you know if he's for women driving then he's got to be a great guy it's like you need to ask another question which is is a version of the truth is going to reform why is he saying he's going to reform why is he after all these decades going to allow women\nTo drive in Saudi Arabia why is he saying that is because he wants women to drive or again is that a distraction is that a shiny object is that um is direction\nYeah you have to ask those questions that doesn't mean anything is right but I understand where you are on the food chain and what amazes me is everybody thinks they're at the top of the food chain\nThat's what's hilarious everybody thinks they're the boss I'm the boss\nI drive an electric car I drive a big four wheel truck I'm the boss like we can both be boss 'cause what if he's got a little electric car whatever he's got a big gas guzzling four wheel drive but you're both the boss\nI mean I'm a Democrat I'm boss I'm a Republican I'm above us okay All right fine you're both by how can you both be bought it just like when we cover all these stories retro redo the global media spotlight same story everybody having a different version and claiming that they've got all the facts\nIt doesn't make any sense\nThat we're moving to Europe and London specifically the LDC talk radio network Trump in taxes\nAnd what the Brits think about it so you remember over the summer Trump got his big visit wasn't quite the pomp and circumstance that he would like to bike for instance when the ... invited him to France but he got his visit to the United kingdom\nAnd uh he got to stay around and get you some meaning to meet the queen got do all of that and now of course the bill has been made public what does it cost to bring Donald Trump to the United kingdom\nAnd of course the scrutiny and this is healthy scrutiny why is the bill for Donald Trump so much higher than similar public events for instance like the royal wedding that also just happened this past year\nWhy was one so much more expensive than the other and why is it a public debate\nAnd the question that is being asked and you'll hear on all of this is it really just about Donald Trump is it about doing a fair job or is it about stoking animosity and creating crises or fake crises so that you can run up a bill and then later on say\nIt's not us\nIt's Donald Trump maybe you can decide here's how the Brits think about it on voice ...\nToday by the national police chief counsel ... Donald Trump's visit to the United kingdom that full day trip back in July cost nearly ... million pile someplace it's a big number but while it is a huge sum of money I mean just combat\nThis for example the recent royal wedding in Windsor Jew conducting the ... the big diet tell you the whole world looked tough\nOn the police and crime commission that for the times ... said\nHe records the cost of that was somewhere between two and four million pounds so I have a million pounds when a big global row wedding costs a maximum of ... million pounds to blaze seems to be an astonishing sum of money are you happy\nBut are you seeing million pounds of your heart on tax money was spent on Donald Trump secure receive mayor who's a new quarter from black have good evening a welcome to the ...\nI don't pay my taxes whole eight to go to someone that tells us in London ... we do not lie\nOr you know appreciate all we do the one that has nothing to do with him like his whole concept that American is anything in America don't come to London and use that money because nobody likes you ... ... ... ...\n...

if you don't know me I also have been filling in another network show for over a decade now\nAnd I've also had my own successful local shows in Los Angeles including on Westwood one's affiliate in Los Angeles seven Ninety KBC board that sounds familiar saying that in fact I got so used to saying that\nThat I went to another station another network showed the engineer said to me or Martin Luther ... uh you know a practice run here and we did and I said the wrong for new station but I guess that's what happens when you're so used to it but we know the number here let's do it correctly eight six six Ninety red eye\nOf the same thing as eight six six nine o seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you well we've been doing the last couple of hours\nWe've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left and the right and that's what I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years that I think it's the second civil war\nAnd you've been reacting to that on line I mean ... through your calls\nBut first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know what the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the error of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with spit speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night\nAnd President Reagan will ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill way was speaking of the house at the time you said that's the day time does that night we're way past that and you saw us in a ground talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power and\nOh yeah probably now you can't even have a drink at night because look what it may have done to\nLook what it may have done to judge Kevin uh\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying as commonplace as with mentioned this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any tax someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and then he was a cold on that he said well it would work didn't it\nWas a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang rape so much so that even the New York times didn't print that accusation\nAll of it is fair game now and now any accusation is to be treated seriously if it has made this key if it is made by someone on the left against someone on the right\nYou don't deserve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated afford but you you just heard you and your masters and deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of it suggests that someone then find science officer one affords attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to lead to harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those extra Senator Hatch so this the goalposts moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the coup across the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right\nThey chimed in because they too are left this group before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nThe ... board of directors deeply concerned about allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nThis is the ACLU allegations that judge Kevin I was engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you see anything then that have not fanatical investigated by the Senate\nWhat would it be advocates adequate seven FBI check eight nine what is it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the an adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament of airing leaders the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nThis is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment of hardest core to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an apartment on the burden is on the nominee the burden on the nominee to prove that something that happened how exactly does one do that the\nBurden is not met as long as there are hundreds of questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation than while I can never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to

out of the swamp if you didn't do you I think you did you did very well\nYeah it did speaking of the victims less someone else agrees with the cell in Kalamazoo, Michigan where I had some cousins or one who passed away recently who lived in Kalamazoo\nAnd I've been there I Love my allergy you had a great place isn't isn't part isn't part of the Portage, Michigan isn't that you know aren't they went around his together yeah yeah yeah yeah I was I wasn't there what's on your mind Sally\nWell the thing that that there are several things that one of them is that if Feinstein really wanted to get to the to\nWin that letter came in a month ahead of time they could have went through the background checks on gun out that she wanted political theater and she knew the me too movement to try to do this and it just made up of fires and unbelievable\nI Am a survivor of a neat too I I had happened to me and I didn't believe ... for for a minute not winning and they use that to make everybody I made a stand out of the hall and they said it back Thirty years in my opinion and I just I could just green\nAnd I hope that it motivates everybody\nOn the Republican side to get out there and and vote because to me that was or what they did to carbon now was absolutely gifts that come out I Can't even ... it unbelievable to me that you would do that an innocent man for political gain complete craziness\nYeah oh I understand where yeah thanks Sally I understand where you're coming from it was hard for me to watch when you know it was the Democrats turn to a question him or not that they questioned him they just put on a show\nIt pretty disgusting and of course is grand pointed out he voted for uh you know liberal or left is a Supreme Court judges and they won in big numbers who we we often are the part where the stupid party and then in my opinion then the evil part I heard someone else said this\nAnd um we've got to learn that we're in a civil war and I want them to get someone who fill the agreed with me where would they go they may have dropped off let's go to Tyler in Reno nevada Tyler you're on with mark\nNevada mark and it's real I I think that uh I've heard a lot of the way too much of rehashing of the last you know a couple of months of political he said she said and all the other nonsense [noise] one saying that the folks that listen to your show could do to help\nPut the ball over the line so to speak for whoever candidate that you want to support\nIs to actually get off your ... and go out and volunteer to sit at the polls on election day angry voters or what we found time and time again I've been doing this since Barry Goldwater ran for office years ago\nOr is that if you have a friendly face at the polls\nIf you have people going to the polls that are still kind of on the fence of where they're going to go you get a seven to twelve percent push\nAt those particular polling places where you have these friendly faces now it won't do any good if you got to curb margin that's all grumpy and you know wants to get in fights with everybody but the thing is is you just have a nice pleasant person there\nAre I always set up a little card table with a bowl of candy a couple of smiley balloons and you know say hello to the kids that come out with their parents\nAnd you can make a significant difference in your community both on the down ticket people and on the main ones like I'm going to be out there for a Dean Heller a starting here in Reno or on the twentieth of October or we start early voting I [noise]\nI I think that uh everybody else if they would take a few days\nIt took a few days off and participated at the polls they could really make a difference\nYou know you you make some good points to the ... the personal touch I've run for office of course in California last\nRepublicans don't want to kill a horn but I'm the personal touch makes a difference because they've done polls and and I seen it in the audience was where they ask people have you ever met a candidate and almost all say they never having when they meet someone and you had a great point in their reasonable decent that's how you can get a vote\nOr the Republicans used to be very good at doing that and then we went over to consultants and TV and I think we went to string some ways let's go to April in New York City are you pro Iran was mark on the road I review\nHigh I'm I wanted to comment you said you wanted to hear a comment about whether we're going through a civil war and I believe that\nThere's a difference the civil war I think we are going to prove\nSomething similar to that but on the civil war both sides of very boisterous and we're willing to fight to the death for what they believed in what's happening now with the media and entertainment and the and the young people there and they don't they only hearing one side we're not organized\nConservatism that organized because when nice guys we believe in being in a civil\nBut this is not the time to be that way because the kids are watching and the nature of young people as they want to be on the winning side they don't even know we exist where all the young kids in ... in school or in the high schools in the colleges the minute they have a conservative view\nThey screen that well how can any person as a young person in ... in college be strong enough to stand up against this title wave and the media and the entertainment um people this is the songwriters of singers\nEveryone seems and is appearing\nTo be liberal so all these young people they say well you know this is what we're supposed to be aware of the good\nSide they think they're on the good site and they're being brainwashed they don't even know they're being brainwashed and we're letting this happen I feel as conservative we should be getting organized which should not be you know throwing rocks and and cocktails the windows like some of the and the food is you know group does\nBut we're not serving our records were being too quiet and I don't think every groan American\nThat's a conservative is going to be able to go against the tide of these termites\nOf little liberals who just following the tide they want to be happy they want to go one friend invites the other friend\nI'm going here and we're going to protest we're going to go down and I'm In New York city when President Trump comes in there's like ... of protest is but I Would not go down there because I'm afraid of getting beat up and I might be the only one there was a different point of view we are being like um bullied\nTo just keep quiet and Chuck Schumer oh and and what's his name Cuomo but he just said lately that President Trump he's trying to get all ... or any violence that goes on he's organizing his people to be violent it was something that happened at a metropolitan club I think they\nSaid Republicans have I'm now ...\nI did you hear what Cuomo said I couldn't believe it he's he's a president from\nThis is the way the the Republicans handled things he got them organized to do that he set them up on purpose to go after the ... seats set them up pleasant jumped in in ... but the kids here this and they believe that it's very serious because it reminds me\nMy husband watches on TV the History Channel and my son watches and he's twenty Twenty one and they show how Hitler isolated the young people got 'em to summer camp they were separated from their parents they only heard what Hitler was saying and telling them you are strong we are good\nWe will defeat and the kids are cheering smiling faces\nThey don't know what they that they're being here at propaganda and we're letting it happen I feel very bad\nBecause if I knew there was something going on and I wouldn't be the only one there and the police would be there to protect and make the children see that there's two ways of thinking but I don't think they know it and we're letting it happen because they're trying to be polite\nBut they're they're gathering all the young people with the media and ... Taylor Swift and all these other singers Madonna I mean they're not thinking in school they're not teaching them to think independently in college if they don't think with the crowd there'll be just slashed\nWhat do you think did you do because I don't think it's a war that's fair because that civil war the two sides were fighting equally\nYeah we wish you considerably more passionate about\nThat are being more passionate that's the first thing I Want to say you you had on teasing you obviously you a very good\nWell here's some I have some optimism forty but you're basically right you may not have heard me say this it's it's not a wonder that students come out and that they're liberal because that's all they ever here it's a wonder that any of them come out as conservatives because they realize that if your doctor and eat them you get them early then that's the way they're gonna think can be except for this\nWhoever the president is seems to make a difference when Reagan was president yet more Republicans\nUp the fact that Trump is president and we're having some great success forget the media I Know that's a problem to get the schools I Know that's a problem\nThey tend to see what's going on and they ... more Republicans are you know take place in the time like that now you're right we got a lot of stuff against us and the republic you are right the Republicans don't know how to fight", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "15"}
