I'm In the end of the weight\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nRap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of\nTheir fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to forty years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay\nOnly the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is\nGone so you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all this is a bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is alive owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life\nInvestment based life insurance of any kind ever now I did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque\nOld school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college\nCame around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap\nFrom him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than Fifteen to twenty two year term\nLife insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible the weather\nCompanies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker the chops several companies and get you the best possible deal or that your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance alone any of it that show that while that's always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on her life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much\nSo just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker ... you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with get with the help they usually a north local providers for your ... what we call PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major\nForeign nationwide and Asia\nOr Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent was it nationwide that's nationwide in it now\nBut um and they're both good guys I like both of them there's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you\nThis is the day Ramsey

decided to you know fell off the map vestments just to do that people kind of\nSaid well why would you do that although it might not people's money interests that's right and I tell you what the\nPeace of mind is great fun you know have a good problem I have is we were able to sell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with you about about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also invest in the amount of money and the market and I'm\nFive foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental properties no outright mhm and ah and do that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I Want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nUm I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you\nA little more ... than I wanted to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think it's excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yeah it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter and how much they go out on you [laughter]\nAnd so there's a ... you know you got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you gotta pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a hassle factor I've got a bunch of it I'm not by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return\nBut it requires management by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... minus expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value or you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the intern right of return the IRR okay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples\nHigher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent right of return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten okay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total what their increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the role is to on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund\nBut I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean ... you know even though I don't management of my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or vacancy or a broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on him and he's telling me the stories

have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each [laughter] now so I I own um outright autographs minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else had won it by three and four fifty percent yeah\nWell I don't ... you know I don't I think I Know your answer there on a\nLeveraging I I'm not going to leveraging the I don't I don't want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two

see I I have a stepdaughter she's ten years old in the fifth grade and she got okay in school but she it was focused attention but surely where she really I got a ... year olds are really good people\nTo start a business for her and her mother right selling a channel that she may\nBut I also want to do it for\nYour your phone is breaking up can you speak directly into it you're cutting in and out can you hear me better now Yes sir\nOkay so my ten year old she prayed\nI got ... we heard we heard I got up to that point I started breaking out of that I went I didn't make it in this roar she's making can that she's making chaotic exactly okay\nI Want a percentage of the truck coach I'll show you thought of Cherry Hill by quite shy you as a not for profit company or showed up at regular L O\nNone of the above I shut\nUp as a sole proprietorship you're over complicating a candle business within your old okay just showed up as a sole proprietorship you're probably not even gonna make any money you make a little bit it'll be fine pay some taxes on it and if you want to fund a Roth IRA for her or something\nThe point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business the point is not the business the point is what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work\nThey're learning interface with customers and how to treat people ah they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something or they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate if she make some money that's just a bonus right\nBut what ... what did you buy in a fight as you've identified the way this kid is wired and a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much you'll pass anything the shiny I run towards it you know so\nThey're getting ready to have it could go off to college in vitro you shop\nAnd understand\nWhat college costs because\nIt is one of the most bizarre thing was to learn the\nThe distance between the less expensive schools and the most expensive goes I mean we're talking eight thousand eighty thousand a year\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people in the student loan debt 'cause they simply go to school we can afford\nAnd as you\nKnow we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars in student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called ...\nNo we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts\nA curriculum in the high schools and in the colleges across America we are now and forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers\nThis common sense stuff of staying out of debt and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nThen what happens from time to time as the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side in the community of business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations and personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've got about four million students go through one of the coolest things happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby that's how that happens the college\nUniversity says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good now Tyler Moore is with me on the line and\nTile is from the University of Wyoming he's the associate vice provost of enrollment\nKyle White uh go man thank you for doing that is\nWell it's a it's a pleasure to visit with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming to be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide from practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and uh and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education\nYeah 'cause you guys do have low tuition I mean you're you're you're you're the best deal round I wasn't getting right\nYes there we are we have the lowest resident tuition any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all the rights of all the rooms are like so like your cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot that's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I heard what your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it somewhere in like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys and cowboy hats that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that can be\nAnyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about curiosity independence vote in this\nEffort soup at adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and look for opportunities to make differences in the world we are talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you know it's not a cowboy isn't\nWhat you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys I mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right that's correct\nYour football team your basketball team whatever's the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so as good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with this way to go man I Love it\nIt's a great motto or does it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you gotta sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\nAs a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guile thank you man\nHappy to be happy to be a partner we we are we are state that had very practical were state that very much um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart\nIs to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation and the state of Wyoming through the rains the education product\nWell it's one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this ... going in there we're we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\nThere's sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I've talked to a lot of Provo is around the country I'm my own chancellor and vice transfer the immersed in Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nThe ... the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nYes sir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who need to know that there are opportunities even out of state but you have to be\nSmart and you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition Doctorow renting institution\nWe are near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north and south we can be a solution that provide students and incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are\nHelping a student be successful\nNot just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion I meant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over or twelve thousand so twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboy\nYou know that's a good school it's not too big and small and so that's a that's just right those are ... just right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on with us\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nI Love it I Love the motto and I think the world doesn't even more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a picture of John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but\nA bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's ah that's very cool stuff I Love it and what a neat thing that the College of the University of the state is buying it for every single high school\nNow if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states\nSome states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know\nBut uh um\nYou know maybe you just want to do it to the hospital used to go to\nUm I went over spoke to at them in the building where I used to go to high school the other day it's now a middle school so I had all the forty\nReally bright and shiny little eighth graders looking at me and it's the hardest speaking you'll ever have I'll just tell you\nUm but no as Anthony O'Neill's got tough job you all but a pretty cool it's pretty cool to

[noise] really left\nAnyway they don't present both sides of the story is that at any of the universities here as far as I Know and that children today are being brainwashed it's a social\nUh it\nIt's terrible what's going on and I don't\nKnow ... people now my rights to assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you got your do now he's pretty far less you had a good prime minister before that oh I had I Believe is\nWonderful and we had our um our debt was not a big deal at all we hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAnd they soon as they put him in a Trudeau because of his name uh you know what he graduated from was um uh what do you call that game\nSack\nSo yeah well when he went to school for acting thing still doing it [laughter] filtering is\nActing you thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing now the official prime minister Ali boy it makes you ever wonder why we ever win an election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the the lady will reduce mail anymore daughters sisters\nA son is it just doesn't seem to matter how ... how do we ever win elections\nWell I guess we're just finding the people that that won't talk to us and the friend us so we don't get you know the people in our case I wouldn't do that you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... or the when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member MacArthur was you know calling everybody communist and ... whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on a national\nTalk about myself you've probably heard me say this I Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative us to talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not a ... million you know what shepherd id and what what kind of America to we have\nIn twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about\nAll right let me know what you think but now you're national forecast for video road lot\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook yeah it'll be warmer and the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecast should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen most of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas\nMark how're you doing well\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you'd mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the effect it as having all the relationships friends family colleagues\nUm I've had experiences where I\nI quit Facebook five years ago because I just couldn't take reading some of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to\nJump in here and and you know say something LED lights and regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because\nIt was revealed on things but how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a ... with a lot of relationships you know\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you indicated I've learned not to say much about politics and the ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to\nSay all kinds of things that they can see if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nIt had done some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore if I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nMark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color adults you're still listening I ah I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know both the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything\nThere is a bright spot and let the Canadians weren't aware that the U.S electorate we're going to do what's best can not get the candidate that the media was trying to ...\nAnd that worked out in the end show all that horrific stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and uh uh\nUh uh Charles Adler and and write and uh and and green or\nAll of that probably helped a jet Obama or get a Trump elected because he was trying to hurt for we're coming down\nProbably helped a jet Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd ah but the reason I called was so we had already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to stretch the inner cities and you're the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected you know where his mandate anywhere\nClear off on another ... and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or your the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review so supportive and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise] ...\nWell I think if they voted for him because uh they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake you know a color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is then he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was my first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the Reverend Wright and\nPretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was you get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people can pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far out left he he really has got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all of that is a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois your honor was mark\nHey mark I've got to average ... observations and then a point to make a first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always\nThe liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem that she went through liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties but they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states\nThat we have powers are as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and I by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is example within ... but they're fascist themselves\nThen they you know when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so I I don't think that's who they are low they pretend right to protect the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the ... Democrats that you could count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democrat Party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he'd six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine o seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ... on read I read\nA book with what I told ...
