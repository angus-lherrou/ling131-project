[laughter] I never heard of it I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you I'm\nMean you you need to build up a big pile of money called Wilson and you don't have to worry about life insurance so that's the general principle that you moved towards a or about\nTo pay our house off in December so they don't have any that um\nAnd so you know in my eye and the more wealth you have the less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm\nRight if you're having a wealth that your family is fine and you have no debt and your family's fine without your income then we don't worry about the subject anymore because you become self insured your families want to go to the point is is the family major income to live right on to the extent they don't need that\nTo the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shocked or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried\nCalled calls render insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nWell I got another guy ... back in March that when I look at life insurance and stagnate says it um they basically said you'd get denied but I haven't tried Zander\nYeah try them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything asked mhm let's talk about it and find out that I don't I think you may be right I mean you you know you probably found some ... research you're probably not insure all you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five underground how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd and uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional uh does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't there's different degrees of it and mine mild but I um when they hit your record it kind of\nGone down by the actual fact you die in our family is left without you what's the probability of that\nLand on that it probably going on and on and get help so I mean it could get worse ... how old are you thirty eight\nOkay so I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old will have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not gonna worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income what you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and he passed away I think your husband get struggle through\nYeah I think\nYou know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy\nAnd they got about three hundred thousand in retirement\nAnd your house just ... ... and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he gonna be okay\nYeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he works right he works yeah yeah so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job okay because\nThe calls and or for informational purposes and just double check your something's okay okay well thank you thank you Michael's with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nSo overall I'm trying to figure out whether or not to continue to build up my underfunded emergency fund or to pay off my car so I can give you a little bit of a back story\nWe teach people who we call the baby steps\nThat you have to agree on is a thousand dollars or are they got\nThat anything above that goes on baby step to any other money goes on that anything except your home you lift your debt smallest a larger issue attack that with a vengeance much do you own your car\nOr Eighteen thousand in the car and I do have a mortgage also in how ... what's your household income [noise] sixty four fifty five other how fast you can pay off in Eighteen thousand dollar car pretty quick what's pretty quick a well right now I'm just making the normal ended up\nSo fast to make sixty thousand are you going to pay Eighteen thousand do that math\nNine months yeah\nYou know life you get the car paid off or you sell the car and moved down there too but you don't need to pay that much longer how old are you twenty four\nTwenty four and [laughter]\nAlmost like I've done this before [laughter] okay yeah so you got a really expensive car and it's kicking you in the teeth so a payoff half the car and I thought oh my God it's really expensive car what is it worse\nA paid thirty and you make city\nIt was it was my graduation present to myself\nYeah I'm also a resident to yourself not a president turning what Brazil do myself is I'm going to run my life you know nobody has said okay let's get stupid thing paid off for let's get it together so one of the two so you got nine months to pay it off with a thousand dollars you got any money saved other than a thousand dollars\nOr or curly with the company match up putting Fifteen to\nStop putting money in your four O. one K. and do you get this carpet off\nOkay and I'm putting three hundred dollars a month into an emergency\nFund stopped doing that see how much are emergency fund a approaching four thousand dollars\nCorrect okay take three of it out but it only Eighteen you're down to one shop all savings\nAnd completely lenient completely focused and completely attack and pay this car\nIf you are unwilling to do those things that means you need to sell this car [noise]\nIf you're a business owner hunting\nAnd his owner I Need you to listen up did you know that more than half of teens today associated stress and worry with money half\nAnd young adults are entering the workforce with no idea how money works that's not okay what if I told you your business could be known as the business making a direct impact on your community well it can\n[laughter] oh\nThe arguing down on the on the after the ... after the weddings over there you\nKnow well I can think of a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter]\nThat is awesome guys well since you are experts in indoctrinated through and through what do you tell\nPeople when they ask how you get that you've been all of a hundred and fifty three thousand twenty three months no matter where you met that's not easy\nIt's not I I think that they get fired with having a budget and having a plan together and they think of that plant every messy and I'd\nSay for for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the Wyoming really blessed and the fact that um\nWhile before we met and I can look back of my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on the we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those dumb decisions\nUm we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases ah we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it you know\nYou got all that on the way while you were single yeah absolutely [laughter]\nGood for you guys very very well done I Love it that is awesome but you're right that's a great story that's a grocery store gives me a whole new idea for a new product line\nAnd you go I think I think to one of the one the biggest thanks for for us is that um we found out about eight months ago that we are going to be having our first\nChild now so we we had about two months to go getting out of debt and we just hammered down to finish this often I Know my personal story my father passed away at a\nUh he was thirty six years old ... our family and a pretty tight spot my mom a as such a hard worker erode the family\nUm but had many health problems which make money tough yeah so I get overwhelmed to think that our child will not ever know about that yeah well not ever know how that life is you know you know\nI'm sure you're I'm sure you euro seemed about term life insurance through with that now\nAs we were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me is that when the Holy Spirit and not just you to do something and you don't have any debt you know what you do you do it\nTo the moon and I was talking about that the other day it's tough to serve two masters that's right and when you don't have another master in your life you only have one it's a lot easier not try Jesus talked about that\nSo well done YouTube very very well done so proud of you I'm sure your families are two ... did you have more cheerleaders or ah I'm guessing you had a lotta cheerleaders\nI have a lot of care later yeah I think you're right and and our if ... if you'd\nClass you know I said my brother and his wife or the coordinators\nMy mom and step father went through with this as well as highly mom and step father her mom and dad's gives me we were all in their kind of together so we've we've kind of grown through this and and just very goal oriented but\nGo without a plan to just a dream so that's that's what that's

poll initial nine point edge for Democrats was reduced to two points by the end of the survey the\nBowling on voters in competitive districts expanded a negligible GOP edge of less than the single

weather or hot races galore is a Michael calling in this evening hello Michael\nHello I I like to say that the battle of ideas isn't just between Republicans and Democrats\nIt's between Republican voters and the Republican Party\nI'm a Republican I Love Donald Trump and I feel betrayed by the Republican Party and that is why Donald Trump was able to steal the Republican Party from the Republican nomination from the Republican establishment\nWe had a trillion dollar deficit this year with it in a booming economy the Republicans campaigns on on fiscal responsibility they promise to defund Planned Parenthood and they did it why should people vote for Republicans I Love Donald Trump and all the good things in our country\nIs because of what Donald Trump is done through executive action\nYeah but do you think that he could only do so many things by executive action and he did get his tax cut through a and there have been other things not as many as we would hope and I have to ask you one other thing Michael before I turn this over two miles damage [noise]\nIf you are a deficit hawk as am I\nGood heavens Donald Trump has never said anything about the federal deficit reduction he's big on on reducing the or the trade deficit but on on the the whole notion you go back to the primaries of two years ago when when there were Seventeen Republicans running\nAnd Trump would be in the middle of the stage with his standing in the polls need look to his left me looked who's right and you would say all these people are going to cut your entitlements but not me I mean as a as a deficit hawk\nI'm I'm rather surprised at that you are somewhat disappointed in the president\nI think he should have vetoed that on the bus spending bill I really do but the Republicans have a a responsibility to not live our country into bankruptcy and they're not doing that and again they promise to defund Planned Parenthood\nAnd are there it's really disappointing and I think this is going to be like two thousand and six in some ways because they haven't delivered they really have it\nWell that'll certainly help the president out a lot of a lot of people and I'm assuming you mark considering including yourself\nA sit on your hands and allow the the Democrats to take off as he's done about all he can do with executive orders if Democrats take either house the Republican and it is to say the Trump agenda is effectively dead\nOr at least there's always hope there's always hope with the Republican control of Congress that you can get more things past like the tax cuts\nThe one thing that would make me feel better and my congressman we come out and say I would I Will support a member of the Freedom Caucus like Mark meadows to be speaker of the house I don't

Bush\nAnd they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut Robert ... rhinos rhino started before that but then ... rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos on the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell in pain or they were saying we're tough enough in the budget so when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone when I was at that uh that that\nThat ah Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty thirty\nOh that that was a that would have been a ... that out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty ... well okay it was the summer spring ... so it was before this one or two of election but yeah All right so you have\nThat scenario and he was called a radical\nYou know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right I mean that was oh no no no that's that's unacceptable now we give the president credit no in fact I I think it it falls on his shoulders\nThe credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because\nYou and I thought that was never going to have right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger\nAnd created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending ... from the campaigning and twenty sixteen\n... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when painter came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh again in the shootout down the shutdowns have never been about tax cuts the shutdowns have been about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you're right they were held rhinos have recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp desktop the spending to stop the sand and even going off his or the\nOr the school lunch program you know and the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything\n... and so when you're that goes back even so much for when you got twenty Fifteen\nAnd you know and and uh a banner was leaving and wind was coming in their banner didn't like Massey so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected or Brian was to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he\nWas automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the the the president back then\nYuri as they wanted him out Trump's gotta Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos out the swap out we've got to cut spending liquor we are today and so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party in in just a you know roughly three years and that way well remember late\nGo back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket for conservative street cred\nBut his street cred remember yeah the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate it was our final question to ah the light of Andrew Breitbart\nYou know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was it was still early but but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potential there he was going to you know that I think it it was pretty obvious by that point\nBut he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should you back on his aunts were basically was ... because ... which by the way rings so true right now does today as thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words\nBut I think it's important but yeah it's I mean look at history and and see what Ryan when swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts was everything under ... being a rhino and being a but now it's changed mhm\nBut ... years ago yeah swamp the state now but yeah a swamp is deep state a swamp is what's going on right down the Senate Judiciary committee with the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McConnell right now\nAs part of the swamp well I don't think no ... Republican leadership right as part of the swap if they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget that they did this year and last year\n[laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up at arm's these guys gotta go not a peep right that shows you the evolution\nIt's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation of where the Republican Party has gone you know or you know were against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of what those terms meant back three years ago\nAnd the fact that the definition has evolved completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is a Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you were going to talk we're going to cut we're going to cut as to where they are today because they're simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has gas\nIf there were pressure if there were pressure right now on spending\nOn Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all that would have been done it would have been a priority of the president's not wrong for ... focusing on national security\nAnd and border control but it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question the mindset of the voters that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away we just want\nThe penalty to go away and we said look at the ... look at the polling from five years ago\nA until they were discussing it last year and and you could see the ... I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah they were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the we need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates and the benefits we like yes\nWell as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever and you're not going to control debt\nAnd that's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no because there was no bad there's no ... there was a small core as well what do we identify a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it\nAnd maybe twenty to thirty Republicans in Congress outside of that you you there's no base to even start from now the conservatives don't control the party you know\nEight six six Ninety right I\nThought you were told that he ... he wrote a [noise]\nJoin the conversation using the shell row tell a hotline eight six six nine zero seven three three three night radio and shell motel on making your hardworking journeys more manageable\nTo keep you trucking cc are tiresome services dedicated to providing high speed tiresome cutting edge to thousands of devoted service\nHundred service Trump five minute alignment chat [laughter]\nWho can keep going on and on but\nSo let's just say we're obsessed [laughter] dollar sixty four\nNineteen forty five [noise]\nThere's no doubt increasing productivity and efficiency as important to you make sure you're illegal profit\nNot just compliance simplifying or operation on the tracks dot com or red eye radio show dot com forward slash the Elvie fast\nMean on\nOwner operator is we know everyone has ... days to make the best move for your business and let Mercer transportation help you take advantage of that freight with no company trucks Mercer is committed to our owner operators success we have fast pace over forty years experience and opera dedicated coordinator to help you manage it all\nSo you can focus on running your business if you're looking to make a move considered Mercer transportation rock solid owner operator driven for over forty years to lose it today at Mercer town dot com or", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "03"}
