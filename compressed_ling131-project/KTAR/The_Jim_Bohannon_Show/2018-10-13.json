that are paid for and he came home last earlier this and that during one about that one but um we mortgage at this point when we're in a profit but markets that we have a construction law now\nAnd we are in the process of turning it into a regular market but I did have a bad feeling about it and I'm thinking\nAbout it and wait until we can get another one without mortgage I just don't feel good about it okay but he he wants to ... and ... of it you know you know because I'm a property manager\nHe said it's up to you yeah buddy bought her without talking to you\nOh no no he bought it we agree on line I mean it together and okay\nSo you agreed on the purchase and now you're thinking you don't want the debt\nExactly whether rent is twelve hundred and don't know if we tend to markets will be four\nHundred and something\nMhm show how much will you owe on the property\nWe were only Ninety two thousand\nThree or four hundred dollar mortgage\nA four fifty seven yeah we did not escrow Texas or in church\nOr did you do an adjustable rate thirty year\nWe did it well we wouldn't do it there you know we haven't been anything mhm\nDo you have any money [laughter] [laughter]\nWell we have um no not really\n...\nOkay I'm In I assume you can sell it and make money on it it sounds like right now All right\nYeah we can we took money up front 'cause they on debt is um and now we can probably make about ten or Fifteen Eli outright but you know when we do it in that and we can make that\nAnd you know two or three years collecting rent but not really because we would have a mortgage on it oh ... oh that's going back and forth\nYeah so what does that you pay off we paid off\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're with us Chuck is on the line and it's our\nJob welcome to the ...\nHave thanks for taking my call sure once [laughter]\nWell my my wife and I have a ... of about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt over the past two and a half years good for you\nAnd what we've only got about two hundred and Fifteen pounds ago because we have our mortgage oil three rental property that we\nHave mortgages on and and the two and a half years we've had a little graduate high school he's in college ... paying about half the today show he's taking out loans for the other half and I and\nI stopped contributing to a four one K. and if I got a beginner baby step save but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nDoing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income\nAbout a hundred thousand\nOkay show can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studio\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on a these rental property as we've been for the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into that I Would rather pay get them through school debt free and then work\nOn the Reynolds is there a reason they plan doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to here and the next two years old yeah\nWell ... maybe some four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which you are cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt\nTo pay on your mortgage is yeah which is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a three three maybe four month emergency fund them then yeah\nAnd then I went there must stop taking out student loans\nYeah and clear him out and then do the same with the other day and then but\nIf you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there is money above that then we start throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounded like a rental are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is tiny but then and then around your house mortgage must be small\nYeah it's about we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand a piece\nOkay a fifty as you said to Fifteen\n... yeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year from now when I was going to feel good and my son is still on the take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make that math work All right Ah yes still I'm just going to blink along on those minimum ... and take care college without that first once we got college without that\nThen we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among ... house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\nAnd then how about first we're getting back on the four oh one K. or not\nSo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right\nYou know emergency fund is maybe step three and then maybe step force Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nAt your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order to actually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order\nRight but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there's money left we keep going down the list in the next thing on the list is mortgages about is that there's so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneously that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump at the for skipping tree tree I guess technically\nYears given five are skipping five oh\nYeah yeah and you had any skip three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're on around the oil out you're back in order that's all we did you can do it good plan man thanks for calling him a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania\nWhen you're Hi Lisa how are you ... the it's an honor to talk to you how can I don't buy them for you [laughter] okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now the lifted it in July for two teams [noise] um I Know there is not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise]\nUm [noise] what are struggling with here we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine good\nLord what does rural area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that occasion because it's on lake we're on water on a on a stream but I'm a realtor than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know so you're not in our in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a New York border but several your biggest\nProblem is you have a very limited market yes the uh I mean three or six to nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than a is there\nAnyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is or a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere that kinda\nSpecializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the house stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives that Jeff not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort\nArea the higher and stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these ... it's so rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work with kids can't do it anymore\nYou know okay I mean kids you know\nWe're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like do we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices your problem or you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll they're just workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and then the ... where it was I walked away there were not client's\nLocation kill them it was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his thought for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot you know\nBut he found a buyer square miles to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one\nI mean do I pick another will call yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses that when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and just gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go\nOh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the\nPerson that can do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel them to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area\nAnd and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area\nAnd they and they don't have a central Meyer stores you need to it's a very unique\nSemi rural ... situation oh I'm Sorry\nThis is the day Ramsey show\nTheft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every day and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen\nIt's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and he wasn't that way on one\nOf those ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France eight or ... beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the force anyone\nWhat's your wired it was really difficult to to give out some things that you know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of oil down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what we want to show then and then we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's a beach with a leg that kinda stuff\nWith the income you've got and no debt you can do anything you wanted to them and you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to and it's and it's not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so right it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nUm family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting very interesting\nShow 'em so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um\n[noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off who were able to pay off the home that we live in ... and so we we use the cash derived from that ... plus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and\nOkay so it was just three properties the that's where I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which everyone operates okay ... ... worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations oil and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation sure

income you got to be loading up so um\nFeels great I mean I'm\nYou know I'm I'm\nI'm kind of to the point of a second guessing even even having so much of our network tied up in a house\nUm so but it

six to six I find it very encouraging\nThat uh as such programs as ah the love go into the catalyst are out there and reaching out I uh\nI consider myself to be reasonably well informed on what's happening in this uh this country\nA I had never heard of these ... or maybe it's a sign of my own a lack of diligence and in finding out what's going on although we know now a or is it just stratified we are that there are very few\nExperiences in common that the transcend the generations in this country that something like this could be happening I've long but it's taken for granted for example David that advice stand in the supermarket checkout line that the uh\nThe names that are splashed across the tabloids first name I don't know who any of them are anymore but I Would have hoped I ever would have heard something about this before now\nWell it is part of it is that we're we're going through channels that are not part of the traditional media and so it's really\nUh I I wouldn't call it a server suddenly\nA outflank in the traditional media\nAre it is it is true however the for the first season we had something around a hundred and one million views in the media and John just awful for example devoted one of his programs to love God and\nThere are many columnist wrote about it many other places are and of course yourself taking the time um it's something that is in it it's in the sentence ended news if if it was something that wasn't getting traction them and I think we have to reconsider\nFame into that we have a call from Ben in New York City who joins us now good evening\nYeah how are you doing guys I'm actually not in New York City I'm On Long Island\nClose enough okay go ahead\nAnd ah well I don't really have a question I think you're you're going a little bit under any age category yeah with uh the home with the millennial thing because I'm thirty five but I guess that puts me at like higher end of what a millennial is even though I I Would identify more generation X\nBecause I grew up around people that you know where\nRace and that are now about forty and I identify more as generation X than than generation y which became a so called Muller anybody that's an undergrad in college right now is younger than a millennial according to the map\nThat saved me they'd they'd be like Generation Z a new one that younger than that that are\nAligning it was about twenty three like my youngest brother would be at that that that you got to get any old and he's already graduated college and have the job so you're you're you're\nAbsolutely right and that you are a millennial you're actually in the the upper half here of millennials which I think goes to the age of ... of a thirty eight now\nUm and of course these categories are imprecise you know there there are many different kinds of millennials but overall there is a certain pattern to them\nAnd that pattern is not unique to millennials it is true with younger people so that when we developed this this program the original season one was targeting primarily college age and threw\n'em your declares the second season is primarily focusing on early career is as the millennial um\nPasses through the demography uh so I think that it's a it's a very much for one thing I should also point out this goes back to something that Jim was mentioning\nAbout the uh cynicism about millennials and it's also true at all as well\nThat ah even despite that um it turns out from very surveys that are about ten of young Americans including millennials support capitalism about thirty thirty three percent say they support socialism oh those are most of them don't want socialism is\nAh the surveys show that um trust in the federal government is around twenty three percent Congress Eighteen percent state governments twenty eight local governments thirty one percent trust in the media itself nine percent\nAnd that most millennials believe 'em and again this is true of a lot of younger younger people as well ah sixty percent approximately believe officials seem to be most it mainly motivated by cell for selfish reasons\nAnd thirty eight percent believe that people like themselves um well I have no impact on what the government does and that's one of the reasons why we also see that overwhelmingly uh I think it's it's almost Seventy percent sixty seven percent of millennials\nWant to start their own businesses because they believe that they need to do it themselves because they can't trust with\nBack and talk some more about that when we come back and just a
