your host we'll talk about your life\nAnd your money it is a free call that eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five [noise]\nJason's with us in Detroit Michigan Jason welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nDave how're you doing today better than I deserve what's up uh we'll just wanted to give you all back story my uh my wife and I just moved from Illinois to Michigan a kind of be closer to all her family up here so uh you know a place for that kind of getting used to everything but uh uh I'm currently unemployed\nA new kind of be closer to all her family up here so uh you know feel a place but I kind of getting used to everything\nLike ah ah I'm currently unemployed I was just like go in the past couple of months and I'm looking for a job now I I'm an accountant and my life as a teacher she teaches special education [noise] um so she currently has a job um my question is we're living with her parents [noise] um for the time being until probably maybe next summer so until we can buy or on house\nUm we've got about eleven thousand dollars of student debt left between both of us and we've got about that it that much in our bank account right now I'm I wasn't sure obviously once they find a job\nIf the best strategy would be to try to knock that get out as soon as possible and then from there start to stay for a house or what my life kind of want to do is just put everything we can toward a down payment to try to you know\nHopefully not pay P. M. I. and get close to that twenty percent of course I didn't know what your take was in I mean it seems like we should still be able to have some sort of decent downpayment either way I just didn't know how you would feel about that\nOkay I don't recommend that people buy a home when they're broke\nBecause it'll make you broker that's why they call a mortgage brokers\nHome is not a blessing when you're broke its curse and when you have debt and do not have an emergency fund you're broke\nBy definition so um my advice to folks has always been and it's not real popular advice and your wife's not gonna like it so you may not do it\nBut my my strong advice to you is to pay off the debt\nAnd saving emergency phone up three to six months of expenses above that save your down payment and then by and when you buy a home and when you move in the house and there's ten thousand dollar still in your emergency fund after you move in and you have no payments but the house payment that houses a blessing\nThis was a day Ramsey show glad you're with us\nHeading into the break I was talking with Sharon in Sarasota, Florida\nAnd a sixty eight years or Twenty years ago they bought a universal life policy which was a type of cash value polishing a portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs\nAnd the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rage and show more and more is going to insurance cost U.S policy gets older less and less is going to the investment\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs\nSo now if you want to keep the insurance not only to zero going to investments but now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just shut all correct\nSharon yeah okay and what is now face amount of this policy eighty thousand a thousand dollars and much money do you all have\nHow much money that we have from\nYou how much you and your for one k.'s and you're now there are always\nWhen we did have retirement account how much they pay total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nWe have a ... dollar identify that prayer have to pay for good hello [laughter] kind of like\nSo you don't have that how much is on our cash value is in this how about you know OK so and you have a pension plans as well yeah okay and so you're\nLiving on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill work he um had thirty six and an income mhm any bank and Twenty one happening already\nOccurring and that's all I I don't get you in the face amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars yeah okay\nWe did look into turning Sharon for him but number one it's really a lot like ... that number two he has to answer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically you know but it was like yeah very difficult\nDifficult but we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is it a year if I don't know how much have a having a month yeah OK so eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\nA month yeah okay\nWell that's a eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise]\nUm\nWell here's here's the equation here's the way it works in your mind okay what's the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay\nAnd so is that war is eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there is no investment value whatsoever so we're not going to be the only question is you know you you don't have a huge nest egg\nOr you you've got a small stake in the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful mhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nYeah they they would only last three or four years anyway let me tell you on a\n... and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug on yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you would catch it out and whatever cash value isn't there a\nBand and [laughter] if I Would like to get it out now\nYeah more way to get it out no way to get out now as close a policy down\nRight which ...\nWhich means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money paid for house and be living on Social Security right\nYeah but you probably can make it 'cause I gotta feeling you guys are frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um [noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are I'm sure are Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they're going to shut the policy down regardless\n... well I Know I guess if we can keep paying enough that it would be over two hundred a month\nI think we could have a guy okay right or we could lower than that benefit and keep it going and they felt like they could do that which is what I wanted to go it went on to catch it out of them are we doing nothing\nYeah there there's not a great answer OK I asked him and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it\nUm ah my tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while okay I'm\nSeventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value and begin to pay the premium\n... and ... you know it's going to do is going to use up some about eight thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that and let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out\nAnd close it down but I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses health but then I was his health\nI'll have a the first time we went to the state cancer free for five years and that kind of a cancer free for two years good so I mean it goes in and get a pet and every every six months or so to make sure it's not coming back of a say aggressive\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open uh-huh if a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going at that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open and if he if he's being if the cancers come back at any stage right you can't you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably drop and at that point\nOkay that makes sense to me it wouldn't it wouldn't be\nInsured oh yeah yeah but I'm not you but but\nAlso not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous\nWith that kinda money you could throw money into a investments to start having some money and um but but at this stage I I'm I'm hesitant to cancel it it's\nIt's obviously a bad policy so I'll be saying that a bad thing but it's your only option you're stuck with me now that makes it hard to discuss and hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years like the cash value pay it at the end of that time if he's healthy uh and still cancer free I'm dropping it\nOtherwise I'm going to keep it if ... if he's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had\nThis problem solved you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance whole life life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just experienced it you should experience the back end\nAbout your life insurance whole life life insurance universal lot verbal life is rip off\nYou just experienced it your six parents the back end what happened\nTo see if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens because the money they put in that that stupid but policy will be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if I had to put it into that and a good investment instead of getting ripped off by this insurance company\nAnd if she was sitting there with three hundred grand plus the other four one K. I'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir house is paid for she wouldn't even called\nMe but instead guess who's fat sassy instead of her insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life I just try to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked because if you understand these numbers on that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself if you don't understand these numbers and you're still selling that stuff that makes you ignorant\nAnd you shouldn't be selling this stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed up way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist so most of the people out there selling this\nCrap are enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist smoke all Charlie show with Israelis and enthusiastic ignoramus\nThat's all one called Charlie we just melding right there\nDoes he's probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that share your if your friend if shares brand sold her that [noise]\nHe's not afraid of my friends like that you don't need enemy [noise]\nYou know she's good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this\nProduct alive life insurance the payday lender or the middle class aggravates me this is the ... show\nIn Arizona you were still means something for a Washington politician like Martin Sally it doesn't mean much at all\nSo you've changed your family tree having sure\nOh yeah they don't know anything other than they've been born into I've never having a credit card which is pretty awesome\nIt was very awesome so proud of you guys did you have more cheerleaders or more detractors as you went along\nAre actually talking about that a little bit earlier than that but my parents are very proud and you know to carrying it on you know some other people oh you got to poke fun a little bay or something and basically now my friends or anything like that it they don't they don't say anything now\nI guess not yeah you're sitting there with a paid for house or shut up yeah that's pretty interesting very neat\nWell well done guys very well done what do you tell me the key to getting out of that is\nBeing ... and stay on track yeah even when you when you grew up I mean I don't want to be the most is all my idea but when I Want something or I like stuff so [laughter] I always like\nThe most expensive thing and I don't want to put up the biggest fuss about waiting or you know being patient hardest thing no\nWell you dinner for seven and a half years you lived like no one else now you can live and give like no one else you're in great\nShape congrats guys who\nWell we've got a copy of Chris Hogan retire inspired book for your number one bestseller we want that to be your next chapter in your story is making a pie just make sure you're listening to his broadcast because that'll keep you moving in the right direction here in his job and the millionaire land and be outrageously generous along the way okay\nThat's how I who are I Robert analysis in Hartford, Connecticut two hundred and sixty one thousand dollars paid off their house and everything but I was thirty two years old seven and a half years it took them making eighty to two hundred a year counted down let's Sarah did three scream\nBoy those go\nKnown you guys very very well done I Love it sat right\nThen you guys very very\nWell done I Love it\nSarah is with us in Ann Arbor Michigan and Sarah how are you\nI'm a great thing for taking my call they sure what's up [noise] so I have a question\nAbout some of the movement tree the final parts of the baby step we currently are added that um\nWe are a emergency fund that fully funded we're currently trying to kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus our house athlete currently oh about I'm Seventy eight dollars an hour then our home\nGood and what's your household income\nJust under two hundred thousand a year so nominal and how much is college on our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them okay good good help for doing that so my question as they currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars in our retirement account ...\nMy husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm my company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest by then they give me ten ...\nSo that it came to my question is do I find a different way to win that that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make light of Fifteen or do we put that extra about three hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIt's four thousand dollars a year doing matter\nWhen they hear it you know your act like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nMake much better and my retirement account you know\nSo I I Want you to put a baby step for Fifteen Percent of your household income you put Fifteen Percent of your household income in retirement it doesn't sound to me like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been 'cause I'm like oh I mean and then you know worried I think that little thing is I put in my five and they put in a timely amazing match you\nKnow wonderful man to love the Mac and going to lose the match we're going to do ten percent somewhere else like you said and Roth IRAs or you can do it during the four oh one gave you got good options if it's raw for one day particularly I Would do that but I I I Would be putting Fifteen Percent of my income away in return to the point is you're going to pay off his house\nAnyway right and really the exact same speed\nBecause for a thousand dollars is what's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off\nWhat's going to get somebody that does not have paid off when you got to concentrate on it when you go a little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze some money out of your budget but ... these three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off cars you buy has been concentrating and focusing in probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get kids off to roll you probably just going to finish up the house and like that year a cause that forty you'll be down to about forty by then and then that year you'll just knock it out so\nUm you're fine you're doing really good obviously\nI mean you're doing really really good overall but I'm going to do ten percent you putting\nFifteen Percent of its been present it in their retirement\nThat's your baby step or are you survive your cash flowing sixes and everything else we can find reasonably within the budget\nHey folks day Ramsey here for my friends at imperial

P. H. D. in Philadelphia pinch hitting for gym tonight on a spectacular\n... a night of the news the midterms and all that you just heard Steve Bannon that was good stuff I'd love to get your reaction eight six six fifty gym but I don't know if you've heard of before it's a rare interview eight six six five zero five forty six twenty six get you to me now\nI didn't get into it because I Know we get into it and I I Want you to hear other parts of Steve Bannon\nBut the caravan is the big story the caravan and Mexico I've seen Fox numbers now tonight swelling to fourteen fifty thousand the caravan of migrants and who knows whom and Univision tonight had a guy in Spanish that's why we don't play it but uh one of their reporters embedded with\nThe caravan says he's met migrants from known terrorism hot spots like Bangladesh what are they doing there this is part of the fear but the other is what Trump ran on tonight in Texas we're seeing a rally that is just gargantuan is anything we've ever seen\nUpwards of a hundred thousand people may have been there all day long with cookouts and tailgating and a packed a basketball arena tonight with Trump and cruise now here is though something a little bit different Fox infringe today\nThey had on independent voters member it's Fox News channel and they were asking these people about the caravan\nAnd here's what the Democrats are believing and I don't believe them and you can tell us that eight six six fifty jumbo\nThere believing there's a lot of people in America we're going to see this as you monitoring crisis they're going to see this is evil wrong Trump I'm not proud to be an American if he stops this caravan and all of his threats listening to these independent voters according to Fox News on Fox and friends this morning\nRejecting pushing back against this caravan saying it's fear mongering and the like here's how it sounded\nLike a let's start with you\nHow big a problem is that that the United states has even immigration laws\nI I think an even immigration laws are a problem for any country and I think our immigration laws need to be modernized and updated ah ah but this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants\nStore so what should the United states do if those seven thousand people by the time it gets there could be tents\nBut this country is founded on immigration and all of us come from immigrants so what should the United states do if those seven thousand people by the time it gets there can be ten thousand going to be twenty thousand what should the United states feel about this\nThis is the ... country on the planet I think we can handle a a a a caravan of people unarmed coming to this country so Letterman and well I I'm saying to process improper John real quick hardly ever there is a humanitarian\nCrisis taking place in Central America and yet this issue gets turned into a complete political football there's very little honest discussion about what's actually happening it gets turning the talking points and\nYou know shooting I'm treating this as an invasion is is a bad idea and it's going to end hardly introduced me to such as that way so I think the ... these these are human beings coming here and there needs to be a real solution um ... offered um in in dealing\nWith who are but the backdrop is the terms and so it all becomes political let's see what happens\nDiscussion alright that's from Fox and friends is one in my audience was outraged after they heard that in Philadelphia today how about you eight six six fifty Jim let's not all political stop the political stuff this is a real issue we go back and forth with this\nWe have awkward says he said it could be twenty thousand unseen varies caravans various things come together\nJust they they're gonna punch through Mexico it appears they've already broken through and they're headed toward the border and it may happen next week tail end of next week right before the midterms\nWell this is the issue writ large in front of this goes on every day not not in the staggering numbers on mass but this shortage invasive behavior has gone on every day I've been to the border I've done shows from there\nThis is the type of thing that goes on and I think\nThis place badly for the Democrats and open borders and these independent guys here saying we'll just let them in is that the solution now you know President Trump is even talked about shutting down the entire border that's commercially and the military\nAnd the only hesitation I have there is you would meet an ass massive number of military to apprehend and stop this church\nAnd if the military had to use physical force firing on people that would not be good but short of that I think Americans say no they analogize it I've had all kinds of people tell me this is like someone just saying they're coming into my house because there's enough of them and they're going to come here and that's it\nIs that wrong\nWe do have laws we do have asylum laws we do have the ability to process this it is not just political\nAnd all this comprehensive reform enforce the laws we already have first how about doing that before we stop at this comprehensive nonsense all the time back and forth with this\nWhat would you do in this situation I got a lot more sounds on this coming up but I'd love to get you in and if you have a reaction to the ban and that was really good stuff here the man of mystery open up about some things\nEight six six fifty jumbo that will do it eight six six fifty jumbo get you to me ... this caravan story if it breaks right if they reach the border say days before the midterm election could be a game changer\nDemocrats in the media or thinking America's totally sympathetic they'll see Trump for the bully and all this stuff that is they won't feel good as Americans if Trump stops it\nI think it's the opposite if he doesn't stop it\nHe loses faith in the base of people saying that's why we elected you to stop stuff like this we don't want this love to hear from you my name is down to your data I'm sitting in for Jim go hand in on Westwood One

has legs moving right to the mid term it kind of summarizes\nAll these things that are out there around illegal immigration America First and all that so let's go to somebody who lives near this uh let's see bill is in southern Arizona near the border hey bill welcome in\nHey how's it going tonight I'm\nVery very good you know I I went to the border in Arizona Sheriff Joe and the like and we often forget about that and you guys have it as bad if not as worse is Texas and the places we normally think about\nYeah um it's manageable a at least the government was smart enough to uh inundate the border with agents are where we ah had control that better but now with these hordes coming as it's getting back out of control\nWhat would you do have a good\nYeah well here's what it is and I've been thinking about this um you know um\nHe ... the president you could send the military down there which is a smart move however listen these people are coming\nAnd it seems that that's inevitable so my thought was\nTo set up a massive refugee camp or we have the greatest military on you can set it up and no time set up with cans and with mess halls in the shower facilities and everything that they could possibly need therefore a we would not be splitting up families and so on and so right\nThere for the Democrats can't go crazy over that kind of thing and then what we do oh by the way we set it up next to a place that has a big airport so you can either do it by the even the air stationery over in Sierra Vista a default would chew cuts and here's the thing is and we used to do this a long time ago what what you're doing this\nSo these people are overly claim some refugee status or ... asylum status and\nStuff and the and what they do is they they um\nSet them up in front of an immigration judge who eventually make the determination on them okay so what they do what they should it was set up\nThese um um um\nThis racket you camp and then have them go in there and make sure everything's all co pathetic and everything's good there\nAnd sent down immigration John ... judges okay and attorneys and everything they can all legal and stuff so that dentist can't complain and then literally go through each families claim or each person's claim like they're going to do anyway without releasing them into the United states\nAnd if they go through this then we could do what's called a jeep pet flight which is a repatriation flight to their country\nAnd that will look when I'm In agreement with that here at the problem though my sense is that so far they're not going to settle for that they're saying they're just coming into the country and that's it because they're swelled by the numbers whoever's organizing this and it's going to be bigger\nI don't know how you're going to hurt them towards these refugee camps to be heard I don't think they're going to settle for that\nWell I'll be honest with you know what ... who's in charge they are are we are\nWell look so your ideas humanitarian aid\nControl your and I tell you right slumped we'll talk into those three countries in saying that we're going to look cut off your ah money that's right well that's good but they're forgetting one big country and this and that would be in Mexico the rights to cut them off to if they can't control it and they've got the military that they can control and we can control\nBut well put thank you look that's an humanitarian idea that the fly in the ointment is I don't think it's acceptable and who's in charge well so far it legal immigration has been in charge

struggling to respond to president Donald Trump but as Republican allies were casting they care about\nUh of thousands of migrants heading towards the U.S Mexico border as a failure of Democrats to help an act immigration policy in the GOP controlled Congress dumped some Democrats said Trump is vulnerable to counter attack on his ... campaign issues\nGiven that his policies failed to reduce the number of unauthorized immigrants yet party leaders and democratic candidates have been largely silent ahead of the midterms and refusing to engage with Trump\nOn this particular issue that's why we said this was a loser from the start where people were saying no what their hope is a you know before election day that these thousands will be at the border and then the military will be there and there will be violence it will be going on and it will hurt the Trump in a war hurt the Republicans\nWell that's not going to happen you know you and I were discussing before him he said well maybe\nMaybe cirrhosis will pick up a bunch of people in his private jet drop a hundred you know in order to ... and people are claiming while that's going to be the next thing they're to be driving cars whatever look the problem is if you have ten thousand that arrived at the exact same time as good a if it's a couple of hundred that's going to be that won't even be news\nNo well I mean because they're not going to be there won't be violence it'll be simply there'll be taken are gonna be violence or simply the border patrol can handle that kind of thing right and if National Guard or needed out there or something like that but it's if the ten thousand all arrived at a particular time\nThat we're a energized and well fed and old decided to run across the border at one particular time well and\nThat's that said look if you just go back to the planning of of of such an event right or just say you're\nA liberal a backer Soros or whoever and you're going to fund this and you're going to ... you know organize all this um what do you expect that is going to happen uh okay uh our plan we'll go we'll go to uh\nYou know organize all this um what do you expect that is going to happen uh

I made I Want to be fair here and there might be one senator on the Democrats' side could answer that would that would give\nYou is even if you plan is even a Joe Manchin\nSaying anything right no no no\nBecause the question is what is it really I mean the party has to promote it you're going to have to have the rest of the party obviously um and you know you're trying to get your tried to take control the Senate you think you're going to win the house you've got momentum in the house you want to build momentum and the Senate races so\nHow do you do that what's the point what measure what level of enforcement do you support\n\nBecause rally in my opinion if I were answer answering there is no half measure and the problem\nWith amnesty is that you're going to do it again later on it's gonna happen you're just saying okay ah amnesty now and then there will be also amnesty later because we'll have the same debate and we'll still have the exact same scenario or Twenty years from

I Do what do you recommend I I I don't know that I Would go into the for me I Would want medical experience first if I'm going to turn to somebody you know\nYou know for for me it's really interesting and I've been blessed that I really never had major sleep problems at all and and I feel blessed because of it but I Know last as I was telling me ... or ... the last week\nI still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time of day who the day shift so tough now I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on the ship and I remember I said I'm going to you know I couldn't\nI was trying to figure out okay what time can I sleep all I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that people that know me and to me my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up mine tire mine my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule rarely do I ever have to you know take even anything over the counter mhm anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in a while and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I've decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle of night get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nUh is asleep therapist who who uh said when I told him I scheduled 'cause he was always concern as my dentist 'cause there was also went to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduling what oh she's asleep twice a day goes when that's how the basically the caveman used to do it came I used to go to sleep like seven o'clock there is no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours and back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it ... you said so you're basically into it and he said do you find many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I've I mean it it's almost said I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me ... tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\nI'm having trouble uh getting to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my life is so busy it literally is a around the clock you know huge family or other business aside from you know this uh and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to\nThis yeah but it is but I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I Can't yeah yeah well I I'm not in my mind in\nPoint I was up to a um a Sunday Morning and uh up until a almost one PM on Monday a afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon I got up at six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes ah\nSee I I Can't I Can't I've known your long enough to know that you can operate with sleep your brain still works my brain does not work yeah the same at all if I if if I don't sleep correctly\nA parade would sleep your brain still works my brain does not work yeah the same at all if I if if I don't sleep crack it is so tough for me to to to do that so I guess the\nCell and for the ... same thing I mean my allergy\nWell yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because had I during that time I mean you know where the where the big family wedding on Sunday and I was I mean I was there until I was the last one house at night falls closing up a venue and and ah and and clearing everything out are loading up\nA but\nHad I had a well a piece of wedding [laughter] that that should [laughter] and you know what I mean cause you and and you have to know that I mean everybody was looking at me strangely although I did I take some home\nAnd I had some Monday morning you know when I when when it was time and I knew that wouldn't be that wouldn't cause me any any problems but you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me to the difference with people I Know people that can like drink coffee\nYou know full strength coffee and have no issues um it's you know comedians and cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coffee and he talks about it and he's they drink you know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups\nIf I had two or three cups of coffee in a day well then that would be no but I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I the diet it's got to be right especially during those times when I'm not going to get that sleep\nI'm going to have to really mind my piece in Houston and lots of water a\nThe insomnia thing I've I've been there\nUm and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly\nBut typically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference it it does it is you are a especially physically you're you're better\nYour\nMentally your your better I mean this has been a big issue for truck drivers for a long time because there's hours the surface to regulate the drivers and\nAnd a lot of changes to those hours of service going back to well gosh going back asking Fifteen Years and and

bit of your play by play on at the big Trump rally Katie Brennan is a woman who worked deeply for governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who is very very liberal\nRunning for president ultimately even though he's barely been in office as governor probably in twenty twenty or the next cycle\nAnd she claims that during the campaign this guy named Alvarez about a hundred and forty thousand dollar job as a housing czar in the Murphy administration after everyone drove her home\nOr you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her she gets a rape\nAh you know they were at a rally or something for Murphy asked use the bathroom comes in and then attacked her\nShe gets a rape kit done tells her best friend who joined her she's shaking tells her husband about it reports it to the authorities reports it to the Murphy people\nAnd then when nothing is done and Murphy's elected and this guy comes up for a job interview reports it all over again reports it even according to the wall Street Journal reports to Mrs Murphy Eddie Murphy's tower they'll get back to meet with her at least the governor did and then they never do\nHere's my point the national media is not telling you about this\nComing off cabin on all that we saw wouldn't this be the perfect follow up story if they were really serious about talking about these issues the only national media that's done anything with this is the wall Street Journal they gave her a forum they did investigation they wrote this up\nAnd now the legislature apparently is going to have a special team investigate this and a a former a judge is being brought in to investigate it\nBut why is the national media not interested in is even the local media only talk radio twelve ten and somewhat and Jay dot com occasionally they write about it\nYou would think this would be all the rage given what we went through with cabinet here's a woman with\nResources does it by the book\nNow Dr Ford you can argue arches only Fifteen back in the day she doesn't can't remember and all this and we're told if the woman says all that though it's true you have to believer Cory Booker in Jersey and these others right well\nThis woman said the same thing and what does this guy gets criminal penalties or not he was applying for a job in the Murphy administer a big job a high paying job and despite all these complaints they gave it to them without any investigation she alleges and that's where the wall Street Journal seems to say\nThe point being that double standard rears its head her name is Katie Brennan\nIn any way that you can spread that around tell people you see the wall Street Journal piece about it it's just one of the best examples I've seen in years of the double standard\nOf what actually goes on so standard coming out of cabin up people on the left in the media you shouldn't be on the court if a woman makes the allegation without cooperation that's just too bad it's a job interview this is hanging over his head\nHow did this guy then she'll get appointed how is it the Murphy's have not met with her how is it the national media doesn't want you to know out there in gyms audience\nAbout this nobody no follow up\nNow even if they want to say they follow the story and the woman they think is crying wolf here well that's an object lesson I could live with that if that's where they come up with a coming through the meat to ear and all that or could it be", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Glendale", "day": "23"}
