Hi\nMr Ramsey fuss fall it's such a great honor to speak to you um\nAnd my question is I'm just immigrated to the United states and I've lived a frugal life I'm like save my money ... but since I've lived in the United states um I've had my some of my clients was telling me\nI'm that you'll frugal living will make your social loud cost you ... if you'd done by next to watch and expensive cars and all of a status symbol mhm I'm you will be treated as a social out to us and I'm going to understand what would be your take on that\n[laughter] I Love it\n[laughter] or did your emigrated from a United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old are twenty nine okay and how long does your living a you cannot eleven years were you a social outcasts there\nUm no [laughter]\nWell ah where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice at a a very legitimate shitty and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal no but um I was like what do you live in the United states I'm I live in San Diego\nOh there to [laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now I'm getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have common sense as well\nSo um I don't know what crowd you're running with was there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you ran with an baths for sure uh because they have been been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider us social outcasts for having good common sense values now a that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm more\nGood well over ten million dollars is buildings worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch it pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks\nA problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I think I'm cool because I have a watch I don't think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you um\nAnd where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nIt was um a childhood dream that I hunt mhm um I read somewhere that um\nBecause this country guarantee freedoms to all people to Supreme Court ruled that no one can be false to recite the pledge of allegiance and veterans got hold of me I was about twelve years old and I tried to uh applied that\nIn my school in India or get a naive I was ... I'm ... the American constitution doesn't apply in India [laughter] and uh and I actually got um a teachable me out and got in trouble yeah I did I listen to the principal and the fact of the principal one day when I make it to the United states you wouldn't be able to do that to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are\nTrying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform\nTo something using a social pressure but not all\nOkay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought through you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom to stuff\nNot all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by things that you have or aware are not impressive people\nWhen you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and show 'em the very people you might attract by having some bling\nBy having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge price to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character\nAnd I'm the I'm ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you ... you and so forth\nUm and so you know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character in our judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you drive an old car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have been and manage them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are good or bad doesn't really matter to me\nAnd so I I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of the ... is that what you're looking answer I think I needed to hear that that will come what are you doing for a living I'm looking IT IT okay what do you do a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to national work rush\n[laughter] Saudi as an honor to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story Weldon thanks for stopping by open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five ... this was the day Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up\n[noise] um I wanted to ask if I should say my tax come here and she reported off information um on our Seventeen Pakistan and India without being being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes\nI Want to pay their taxes and penalty yeah okay I mean it sounds like a percentage on the information as well that\nFalse information she lied yeah intentionally and you get through that\nYes why we do manage\nTo get up at my money I don't know but I think that she claimed that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird yeah I mean does your husband have something to do with this\nWhen he doesn't have heat that we can see what you\nKnow I mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have an cars you don't have a knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have the church but you know trickle down a path so there was no there's nothing in them the documentation that mentioned anything about the church they use our ... our number of aid that high but when the number ... ... this random\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one C. three as a venture lists that you're being paid uh outside of the church you know you're not you don't do speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side\nNo everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and you know for the church we don't make any money for the church if only we both work independently ... another company\nActually you have your by vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I don't I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question because I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing someone would do this just out of the blue eye is not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication\nAnd so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you sign the\nTax returns though didn't\nKnow anything they don't you know but you had to see the ...\nYou you you didn't allow someone to send in tax returns are due to see Shirley Hi aid you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and asked them a hot my guess is the most you could hope to get back will be the penalties the taxes\nYou already oh and you still owe the penalties are due to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know\nDid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every\nAlmost every American has had their personal info compromised or act over\nFifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that they or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had it happen more than once she this is unbelievable wants the ... get your info the risk never goes away and they can use it whenever however they choose it truly has become an issue of not if\nBut wasn't worth a lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happened to own one of the Volkswagen diesel\nWas handle yeah you know and\nYeah and they were offering us you know we could do that by Dr that and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we get the buy back and got the cash settlement and got rid of the payment and the position that would put a fan of it actually had us at that point to where we would\nPay off in thirty six months and about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back on the phone from what I've been doing and he said he would buy us F P U\n'em for Christmas and allow us to you know to the program at home we kind of live in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would ... the next day or to talk to him and I was a little nervous because the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he\nGot you got any man that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the minivan but yet but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like most and I told them about my spreadsheet that I made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this um\nAnd\nI I thought you were you were ready to you are sick of this\nOh absolutely\nYou know and then you come home and you guys going to be Schumer city\nBut we didn't end up going to what we did it um through the program at\nHome home study gotcha yeah our church is an hour and a half away and run right\nNow now now days you could just watch it all on line but it's different than yeah very good you guys so what is the key to getting into that you made already one thousand and they do much more than ... for\nAll the votes like in the well they paid off alone as another ten thousand and then we also got about an eight thousand dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one month yes All right and then what what is the key to getting out of debt and you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um\nI Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication we're both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than in the past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nMhm which she she didn't have as good a job as I could possibly expect exactly what she was by herself but she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how was being done exactly where we were our new small numbers I did not have the big picture\nAnd you know guys being visual creatures the disparate she gave me the big picture in color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a huge last summer the control one but not in law but you've gained um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\nYes yeah it became amazing actually what happened with that with this was beyond flabbergasted me because\nHe got so on board that what went and got honestly you had a huge impact on this because he was told there'd be no more extensions and that was back like just a few months before we started and then I'm about to\nBe about a year into it\nHe gets a call he he was home during one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they just got back three weeks before but they want it needed him to come back a month early and he gets off the phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like\nI don't know do you want to go back and he's like what what would you do with our debt and so I we were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew um but I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating\nAnd I'm like you know what if you do this\nWe can be out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like wow I didn't think he jumps on board and he he actually told them that he extended for the the lines you know if they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee us to get it all paid off in that time\nCongratulations you guys were so you you've got a copy of course opens returns for books for you that is the\nBefore you that is the next chapter in

the Green Berets he is briefed among others the CIA the defense intelligence agency and the national Intelligence Council\nHis previous book is defeating ... the winnable war and a\nOne eight six six five oh jumbo is our number\nDr ... you take note of the idea that there are two spectrums of ... objective truth and subjective truth I Would contend that wild that indeed maybe put forward out there in this world of ours that subject the truth is an oxymoron your thoughts\nYes absolutely totally I I think it was incredibly telling your call this and the Kavanaugh earring the Democrat said at the starting with Cory Booker used the phrase\nA truth when talking about that testimony from ... to fold\nBuddies so telling the truth\nThere's no such thing as a truth the truth or there isn't true so yes this is this is what you get this is posed motives and this is the the the construction of the left and the twentieth century whereby there is a denial of objective truth so yes the politics there were divided into two groups\nInto two groups those who believe there is one truth and those that believe everything is relative the those that believe that everything is relative um they they create the atrocities of the twentieth and twenty first century\nWell what if I put forward a subjective truth that says that every single member of the Democratic party\nActually a communist and they were out to destroy the United states I mean I don't have to subscribe to that view although I Would to concede that in many cases they are certainly pushing policies in that direction but\nWhen I just said I wouldn't subscribe to but how would a believer in subjective truth telling me that my objective truth was wrong but there is this right\nWell you know the best they they'd have to fall into their own trap there'd be no way if they if you believe in the concept of subjective truth for multiple truth there'd be no way for them categorically to deny your accusations so this is\nThis is the absurdity of of the whole situation so yes it's it's a very powerful weapon that you can use against the the liberals the spouting it every day\nYou identify Islam as an extremely radical religion certainly as it is practiced in much of the world today that's obviously the case now uh what about those who identify Islam as a a radical political ideology or in Islam is there really a distinction\nWell it depends I mean there's there's the theories as the theology and then there's the practice so the question is what what is the practice if if if the Muslim who's living in America\nA and a behaving in accordance with the U.S constitution then there's the problem if it's a country such as Bangladesh will or elsewhere\n... becomes the legal system where shall real law actually becomes the ... of the land of such as Afghanistan\nThan we have a problem because then the the truth that we hold to be self evident the quality of the quality of the sexes these things fall by the wayside so\nYou know blanket statements ah a dangerous in this case because we have Muslim allies Jordan is one of our closest allies that is a Muslim state but we have to be specific about the context in which country and who we are actually talking about and\nBut one thing that has bothered me a great deal about where this country finds itself today with the people on the left\nAre pushing harder and harder or to outright a call for socialism I suppose in a way it's an improvement\nThat uh you have people on the left who uh or at least are saying openly what I always suspected they were thinking over the years and that is the socialism is the path to go I Do think that they've overstretched overreached I should say in that regard or is that the term socialism no longer a four letter word in this country\n[noise] [noise] yeah it's a very good question I'm disturbed that in the upcoming midterms\nFor the of the Democratic party candidates have\nOpenly labeled themselves a socialist\nA in a recent poll by the victims of communism foundation more than forty two percent of American millennials said that they would like to live in a socialist or communist America\nThis is incredibly disturbing if you look at the fact that in the last hundred years more than a hundred million people were killed in the name of socialism communism so\nYeah I think the Democratic party all the radicals who have taken over the Democrat Party have managed to socialize this would make it more acceptable than it ever was before\nAnd as we go to a call here I just have to have this ... it seems to me that what we are getting is nothing more than we should have expected we have for about two generations\nAdvocated control of the education of our young people to people especially if the College of faculty level in many cases have an absolute axe to grind and I'm very anti American ideology who are less and less likely to try to even hide that fact now\nAt a private school it's probably difficult to do a lot about that but in many cases we're talking about faculty who are paid out of state tax dollars and why the chancellor isn't presidents of these universities have not been called before the education committees of every state legislature in America\nAnd demanded to know why such and such and such and such is fired if they want to see another penny of state tax dollars is beyond me\n...

country that have taken over such a World War two America let your guard down\nNow you have to have your guard up I'm Donald Trump ... you're in the best jobs that I've ever seen of pressure to end times especially at times like Josh\nNow now you know all the other radio talk show host and all the people that are ... of the um they got in an era and on the Bible in their head on and they're Trump followers and the constitutional issue or a\n... you know ... the republic that we have here but we look to life liberty and pursuit of happiness is important in Belgium to\nAbsolutely and we got to go to the break he does believe it and that's what makes such a difference a ... it's important to understand that about the president but now you're national forecast for video wrote log\nSeen the past couple of nights some freezing rain and the area of western Oklahoma north\nString Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado but that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain\nHas moved off to the east and warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those looks down through the architects region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael not necessarily going to be associated with any rain from this from ... but\nCould see a pop up shower or to looking for rain for the mid Atlantic today all the way up into the northeast for New York city and Boston so that leaves a good portion of the country dry today the mid west the northern at Central plains the Rockies Pacific Northwest and west coast\nI wouldn't do it in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you a chance\nBut don't try to read my motivation on my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules in our procedures and it's not barbaric to say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go\nYour return\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say it or not the way they handled it not necessarily joining it in the first place separating the show around here with that but if you want to go with the separation being warranted it's the way they they ... they say half bought\nHandled it let's just say for instance the real quick I took like say the Chuck E. cheese recently I had a bracelets said one two three for example that my child at a bright says at one two three that way when I was able to leave their verified the bracelets ... there were a lot of my way they could have done something similar but they didn't do anything she's got children\nAre all really it was first of all it was done and a half but way\nWhen it first of all it's an unelected judges so you were trying to prove something by the judges if the judge ... he knows what's ... what's best for the country and what's best for the rest of us he never got elected to anything but leaving that aside\nThe parents shouldn't be bringing these and that's what I Do what you said you would do the same thing if you're a kid no I wouldn't bring my child up if I knew they can be separated from me and and once knowing that I I just wouldn't do it in the first place they're the ones that are honest and give us yeah\nYou miss understood the air if you were taking those routes or that route and your child was was ripped from you and and and taken from the border and putting some concentration camp a dog\n... on a ... year would be very well you're giving\nYour giving you you're just giving an awful name to what happened to the Jews and others were putting concentration camps these will not concentration camps they weren't close to\n... have you seen that footage where they were they were visited they were not humane due to uh to house children\nYeah well I I didn't ... that's not my impression\nOf and that ... one point one point I have on a number of okay I'm going to give you some more time there going okay\nPraise there was a there was a a press briefing had recently okay we're seven minutes and thirty four seconds long he said the ward Barry twenty five times\nOr you might be like why are you bringing us up he talks like a used car salesman if you listen to his speeches everything is very very very very\nThat one way to heart you know I'm I'm I'm a teacher I'm a teacher and I have I think I'm pretty good ... I don't care if he has a queen's English the king's English sorry\nI I don't care about that I care about what he does you're paying them saying very twenty six times you sound like all the latest you're putting them down because you're so much more fish are well here's my point no that doesn't movies is Charles me because he says very\nTwenty five times it proves he has a problem maybe with the language he doesn't speak as well as you do\nWhen we go by car the demand is going to say it could be ... or a gas mileage it gets very good he speaks in most ways very an awesome and great to\nSee a pattern of each power sharing it so\nNow you're putting down used car salesman they provide a valuable function I ... I Wonder what you'd be like if you were you picked on me what if your daughter was a used car sales person I mean what are you saying you're picking on them because of a language because he didn't go he didn't go to Harvard or something\nWhat are you saying\nThat no matter what I had a decent education he talks like a third grader\nGeez I wouldn't for do I mean come on these these are not important and relevant things I you know what\nI'll say this was a dollar in Mexico a cow and let me find themselves ...\nLet me finish let me finish you know I have a pretty high education I don't have a PHD but I have a master's degree but I don't care about intelligence as much as wisdom and what people do with their lives\nAnd he's done a pretty good job pick on something he's done as president besides that was barbaric the way the kids were treated you haven't done very very that's what you're picking on that is what you're getting them on you sound like the latest\nIs rushed tax bill ... first of all everything that he does is washed okay but it's\nNot a tax bill ... pretty much statement surely when they\nJust ... is the thing that that really irks me is the sunset clause on the majority of the tax breaks for the middle class it was done they changed my opinion largely oh here's rich friends not the average American\nOh jeez they by the way they corrected that as far as I Know the house correct that it's so there isn't a sunset provision so I think you're wrong about that but that benefit is rich friends how about the fact that I like it and I'm not rich I Love the fact that the you know the fewer regulations we have the more you get to keep more of your own money ... not the government's money\nI Love what he's done ... says ...\nOr like a tax deduction you're a ...

Obamacare is still on the ropes of the Republican Congress has passed session could do nothing it seems about health care and yet the problem persists and it's a very real problem for many many people Lawrence calls in from champagne Illinois hello Lawrence\nDid he get all the time it more orientation errors Jeannie see is that sort of like a political candidates except you're selling ideas about health care\nWell first of all his GDP a and this was as good a time as an aide to have done some explain exactly what GDP advisors is\nLawrence thanks for the question always liked outing our company\nWe are a consulting firm we traditionally help advocate on behalf of employers as well as patients and members of the healthcare system\nTo try to navigate what is often times very confusing system to do so so our clients normally are corporations that are trying to help their employees find more cost effective ways to help navigate the system\nAll right Doug was there anything else that you are you wanted to ask you about Lawrence\nGood I think I can make my contribution now\nUm I basically I'm a physician by the way I basically agree health care prices are crazy high also just allies in psychiatry back in the days when I charge thirty and thirty five forty dollars for a minute\nI actually made more money that way then over the years as it went higher and higher a I Want to express my consternation and and and lack of understanding of what on earth happen there are\nThose are days when I was very busy and I didn't pay any attention to accept doing my therapy keeping up mentally a medically competent and and my ordinary life but everything went off the screen and maybe you have some insights but um I Want to make a point here that\nOnce upon a time I think the medical world was more\nUh like I was able to do it in the early days of my practice of the people were coming in the hiring me it was their our it was their time they could talk about whatever they wanted it was my job to try to keep the ball rolling in a constructive way that was going to help them\nResolve the problems that they originally came to me for but still they were in charge in that respect I think that's different\nThan what your gentleman that we're talking about a yet I'm quite knowledgeable about the BPA ca and I understand the need to help corporations figure out\nHow to uh buy health care for their employees and I'll be quiet now and listen I have another idea or two but\n... okay well let's let's get to that and the second or so stay on the line but the your response or substance and\nWell there's a couple of things and when we're when a wry we've started to see that I go back to the first part of your question or comment warrants which was you know back in the day it seems different than it does today and that she gets back in the day it was different\nUm as as we continue to monetize the healthcare system from a business perspective I now\nYou you know we can actually draw very clear and close parallels to what we saw in the banking system right two thousand eight we had the banking system a consolidated into a level of what we consider to be too big to fail\nWe're seeing that same thing of her in the healthcare system now health care systems are run by doctors any longer run by Wall Street run by businessmen\nAnd and and the challenge that we have here is that we can say I need to see consolidation used to use it you would have an insurance company in conflict with a hospital system or a doctor system trying to negotiate contracts and reduce the cost of health care they're no longer doing that\nThey're actually working together and working together because the health ... as a result of the Affordable CARE Act\nInsurance companies are are limited on the margin of profit per the AC a at Fifteen Percent now if I'm a CFO and a CEO of a Wall Street based organization and I'm limited to a Fifteen Percent margin\nI Want Fifteen Percent of a million dollars or Fifteen Percent of a billion dollars\nBecause my fiduciary responsibility is to my shareholder not to the patient the by my product and this is part of the challenge we have an healthcare system where the finance companies ... responsibility is to the shareholder not to the consumer\nAnd so we started to see this move when I got into this business over Twenty years ago there were over twenty health insurance companies in Texas where I live today there's four\nSo as the consolidation of the market has occurred and fewer insurance companies are in the market and they've doubled up the market share and now they're going to the hospital systems and working in a line that used to you have a doctor and network with one maybe to insurance companies now\nEvery doctors in network with almost every insurance company so this idea that insurance companies have the ability to utilize leverage to bring down the cost of health care\nTrue at all discounts don't matter anymore prices do\nAll right uh the the the leagues that covers quite a bit to think that you would like to add to that Lawrence\nWell I can add and bring up the the second point a Sam ... is a thing um there's something strange about a\nA doctor's turning over the running of hospitals to people called hospital administrators are most hospitals administrators have a bachelor's degree\nOr they couldn't ever get into medical school yet or doctors who are no more interest martyr actually let these people run the entire ball of wax now related to that I think is the need to get these costs down hospitals are even worse than\nA doctor prices are the ... and the\n... were coming up on a break here that does move I Do want to hear what you have to say but we're going to have to pause

our guest the ...\n[noise] well listen I mean yeah [laughter] definitely has been the practice of the federal government for the last goodness multiple decades um to to look to move money around and and effectively just rack up the debt let's look at the national debt right now\nA Social Security and and\nAnd even Medicare for that matter is is\nReally insolvent if you actually look at the way it's structured now and the money that's going out while it may have cash and the coffers from a standpoint of we we the government reports that there's money to cover these things it is very true that they move money around in different ways they're borrowing\nAgainst the defense fund and a number of other things to make sure that there's enough money to pay for one thing that they've committed to and this is again going back to the well we talked about in the first segment why Medicare for all\nA would be effectively just a massive\nAre the only way to do it would be to massively collect taxes and continue to borrow\nI'm with the baby boomer generation where they are with life expectancy doing what it is doing and that's the thing Medicare and Social Security we're not originally set up to be this ongoing thing Social Security was originally created\nTo ensure that the American citizen didn't outlive their retirement savings\nRight and so but we distorted that in a
