[noise]\n\n\n\nSame way\nMedium\nI'm Dave Ramsey your host this show America\nYou are with us thanks for your open bones triple eight eight to five five to two five eight to five\nFive two to five\nBrad starts all the hour in Phoenix, Arizona welcome to the Dave Ramsey show bread what's up\n[noise] Hi thanks for taking my call there sure how can I Know\nI have a question are we are my wife and I are just getting started and baby step to ah we've got about Ninety thousand in that\nAnd we currently have a three vehicles two of them are mine that I use for work they're both paid off um I use a truck and then I also have a come your car that I use regularly on most days of the week but the truck I have to use one per week to court trailer\nHer car she\nOwes about eleven thousand on and it's ... percent interest we could probably get by just sharing my two year olds [noise] um\nBut we just didn't know since the car loan or they're ... percent interest should we just sell it to you know get rid of some of the dead or should we or should we keep it because it's still prefer\nThe zero percent wouldn't enter into my decision it would just be whether or not I wanted to work hard enough to pay off the eleven thousand dollars in debt and how fast you can pay it off water all three of these cars worth\n[noise] uh the truck is probably worth about fifth tune my car's probably also worth about Fifteen her car we think we can probably sell her for about ten\nOkay 'cause one rule of thumb is you don't want vehicles things with motors in them totaled up being more than about half your annual income because then you've got too much stuff going down in value\nOK okay not violating that though show or good or the second rule of thumb I use is can you be out of debt everything but your house in two years so what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and forty thousand good and how much debt other than eleven thousand dollar car do you have not counting your mortgage\nOr we have about Ninety thousand\nOkay but that it that include the car the rally the car and what is the Ninety thousand on\n[noise] mostly student loans or we have some tax stuff a medical bills\nOkay so can you pay off forty five a year making one forty and be debt free in two years my answer would be yes yes\nFive to ... to a new job in we'll talk about your life and your\nMoney Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi Taylor how are you [noise]\nGood how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for for taking my call I've been looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college money from my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby step for I'm about Seventy thousand dollars cash mhm um I Know that other than my house um which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage\nAnd when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on it so I have some you know equity um and\nUm and I had about fourteen thousand coming in\nAs a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a check five twenty nine I think for him and and kind of picking out some growth stocks mutual fund\nTo kinda see where it goes from there okay um so my question is what are kind of my\nWhat do I deal with this kind of a pile of cash that I have um you know ideally I Want to keep my living expenses for\nFor um you know having any given month is about twenty\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with her child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter] um so I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then kind of want to know what to do with the rats shake shack throat towards my how he owns a little bit every year or\nShould I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we call the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial planet tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses um that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so at twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate\nAs adjusted an emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so uh about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah yeah okay\nAll right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a I had a pension um that I put a about\nA hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it um so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nI'll tell you that mandatory okay\nAll right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent is a Fifteen Percent or Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of kind of the global and hide hundred\nFor me I'm familiar with what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo shortcoming they're they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in robo just to stay to the game there'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do\nWith some or you know in certain situations and so forth but what I Would do just go to smart pastor Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business I don't care what you do okay in fact my income at all\nBut people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you\nYou and your argument you you're married\nYet married um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you\nYou're over fifty years old and but that gets you there and fifty five hundred is eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded Roth IRAs and I would have those in growth stock mutual funds I spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend\nAnd I put a force in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it in mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart Mr pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that that's maybe step three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement\nFive is addressed kids' college and it's different in in you know number ... how many kids how old they are and that kinda thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent above that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house 'cause I'm going to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step in that's max out all retirement\nAnd invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy or which you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget almost keep jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this rate\nThat is what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional service academy or three years ago\nUm and the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal that I'm obviously much smaller so my question is I'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact it will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount in fall\nUm yeah um and what is your income now\nSo it varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be a year at least a about a hundred ... a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWow so you might learn if you guys are on the side and so what I'm going to just put this on her Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start someone thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money\nYou're going to get on a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious I'm about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies got this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nIs er so yeah a little known fact that you are just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask the surf through and lip service or you're assigned to the\nRecruitment and death\nUm and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid it goes over to the U.S treasury\nSo you have the option of serving\nAs an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge have to pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with fish I did not know that you have to learn something while well the only good news in the short story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nDealing with most homes security companies is like dealing with the bad cable company you wait around all day technician you spend hours on the phone to get your questions answered and when your patients finally runs out\nHave no choice on what happens is is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and hand it plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that I bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago but\nThat never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January cook myself you know of of her check because\nHeart when I got ... got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nWell he was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind the rest\nOf my case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to\nParticipate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom did this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent from mom of initially\nBut if you can get her ... I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and that beep perpetual\nBut to do that it was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again but you like go to the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was on a healthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but if she doesn't she going to hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen hey innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nOur now she only did he medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want them just you know you know fall the rest of their life\nIs I mean they add controlled or she has a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as a semi mentally ill and she is with she's not on a couple of different methods she does\nHer own her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen\nYeah and it happens to people all the time though what did she say right now when they call her a yacht so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you're just a you know because they're going to just I don't think\nI should be talking she should be telling\nThem either one of the American long conversation it's I got nothing you get nothing because all they're gonna badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the death right\nWell my husband thinks that if this goes on a year or two it they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months\nOh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months how they're going aren't\nPliable today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any ill so they get nothing\nThey get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people call collectors\nUntil let's say I mean showing a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight hundred there does she say look it can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they all your Thirteen hundred bucks you haven't seen any money in two years I'm now back up and working again I got five hundred dollars if

fulltime job\nUm it's been a couple of years now or ...\nYeah I haven't been able to find anything else comparable to what I did [noise] um so and I\nWill you let me tell you you're emotionally not passed that because you're the way you're describing it it sounded like it happened yesterday yeah I mean you're still would have been living in the abuse aren't you\nIn your head\nYeah I mean my kids and I we we were homeless for a while we we both are a lot and I read he tried to get custody of them I had to go to court trying to deal with everything and it's been a lot\nI hear ya so basically none of these bills\nAlso the foreclosure or all the bills that he opened up and your name have been paid for years\nWell yeah you haven't paid anything on them for years so there's really nothing on fire today that says you've got to fall by friday right\nLabor George Marshall was the lead your here Kimberly Israel in Alexandria, Virginia\nKimberly welcome to the day Ramsey show\nToday thank you so much for taking my call sure was hot [laughter] absolutely my [noise]\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nScale works He works in a steel plant\nMakes about four fifty to six fifty a week um about couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had a paid he's behind on a lot of itself had a somehow got a fifty\nThousand dollar loan from the bank and he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and some of the security and I'm just wondering what what what can I give\nAt this stage for him um I did provide him took over other bills\nAnd I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of that I'm Sorry what are you doing what the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying all and I'm paying all his self he still has about um Fifteen K left on the equity ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd how much are you able to put on the debt\nI'm putting everything\nWas a turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about\nA thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIf you will have on the car eight on a house and she didn't want to credit card\nOkay All right and it ... you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right your ankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and they still work in the steel plants and understand that right yeah ... there's going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nAnd I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent debt free house and everything you can probably make it on a Social Security if he had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what\nWe want but we can probably get there and uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency fund a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start building some nest egg for retirement but the fastest way to build a nest egg for retirement is to clear that dead and to have that emergency fund in place\nAnd he is still the baby steps in other words\n[noise] okay that sounds good well I'm asking is why a bank loan um someone at his age fifty K. animal you know four and a and it\nCould be paid off in twenty forty three knowing that\nHe went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid and the second reason is they're counting on the house I've got to lean against the house right now that's true\nAnd show the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is\nYou know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry I mean they'll they'll loan anybody this breathing or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid show there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ...\nSo the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes people go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered adult that credit card\nSo I mean dead people get credit card offers show is you know it doesn't mean anything he doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be done\nThe dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how're you\nDoing today I got to require retirement OK\nI'm here about a year ... and um I got ... venture and then I'll have a four weekends off of it pretty good way mhm I quickly here at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before we take for we have for\nThe whole time and they\nYou can run the mouse out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it say words if you're white from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more in a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and uh I I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely help\n[laughter] yeah so you got to kind of gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... death I drove a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty is higher than that because that those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got a real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Todd is in New Hampshire Hi Todd how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you\nBetter than I deserve how can I help\nWell um I I when I spoke to the lady she said I could ask your question and I just got the starter pack off of your website for myself for my for my daughter who's thirty one I'm fifty two and\nUm I've been a dream or I guess for a free spirit is you would say from listening to your show addictive Lee now for the last two weeks [laughter] I Know who you were before that it's All right but um my wife and I sat down and we've never been able to agree on money um she used to shave or um the spender\nAnd just I don't you know I don't know what the money situation is where I go and spend it [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] five we've set aside step one we've got a thousand now we've put aside to the shaving she wants to say more than that but\nShe um she's always ran the show and I've been kind of just kind of go along with her at this point um we paid off to credit cards and we paid off another credit card my question is is\nBy doing so many things right now I'm In the one thing I'm concerned me it's about down the road is my retirement and I've worked for a company for Fifteen Years and I've got\nAbout ... eldest daughter pack was the total money make over a book in there\nYes it is I started to read that I haven't\nRead it was total makeover has every detail about the seven baby steps as the seven baby steps on steroids\nAnd so it's going to walk you through first thing you do you save a thousand dollars you get on a written plan you and your wife or an agreement and we're gonna we're in agreement that we're going to work this plan together okay and once you do that then you're first goal to squeeze out of your budget as you say that that was in dollars every already got money saved\nThan we would save only a thousand dollars of it stop all investing\nTemporarily temporarily temporarily and then you move on to baby step two which is your debt snowball and that's where you pay off everything except for home busting your\nDebts smaller flaws\nWhat caused by getting rid of those that famous and now you've got the ability to invest\nSo that book is going to walk these

collusion just weeks\nBefore the twenty sixteen election and before just before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign\nWill get to that coming up falling to the bottom of the hour Haiti NPR poll out there\nYeah and that's interesting the net National Public radio poll that shows that uh the Democratic enthusiasm edge for the election has a ... and it was a ten points just a but in July right and now it's down to two which is in the margin of error which means it's a dead heat\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting because I've been questioning the methodology\nA and I mean just not that I doubt the methodology I'd just have some questions about the methodology and what's going on with the way the but the FiveThirtyEight dot com is putting together they're basically a composition type poll based on all the polls\nAh in all the districts are for the house seats it's interesting to look at it but I'm not so sure that I buy that well as of right now it's roughly Seventy five percent chance that the Democrats take the house\nUm that may be the case I'm just asking about I have actual questions about the methodology and how they're applying it to this big scale I'm very smart people at five thirty eight dot com\nOr so but I Do wonder about again the polls they're using I'm a registered voters versus likely voters a demographics and everything else so you know all that is important when you're trying to put together a something those numbers\nWe don't make predictions but certainly you look at the polls\nAnd we want to look at those ... I think especially after from Thursday last Thursday on ah the Kavanaugh hearings couple of things I Want to briefly touched on coming up on the bottom of the hour Saudi Arabia his increase or crude production why ... is from Bloomberg\nTrump ... yeah same you'd better do it you want military stuff you'd better do it that are on the way for on attracts here's your forecast\nUnusually persistent

thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers five Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nWith a frontal boundary lingering around the mid west we can certainly see the difference in temperatures in Chicago from today's high sixty eight\nWhatever they say I just want to throw right off going on over there are quote unquote good call me and they're not but right 'cause they're just you're using the term but he's destroyed that term rabbits like\nThe uh the the whole uh Brian Regan does a as a comedian my favorite I think people know that if they listen for any amount of time does a bit about the no nonsense judge\nOr what does a nonsense judge look [laughter] I mean if Brian does it a much better than I Do and and but that's the point I mean over the years we've heard well that's a no nonsense judge on a total nonsense judge\nOkay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter] it in other news of this from the hill dot com this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and the yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion\nJust weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign and former FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThat's the term used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele to compile the ...\nOf ... cooperated man never we talked about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow where colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins who we law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground above the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department have withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have\nYou have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured Warren right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be why would that be\n\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days or they just want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices this from Bloomberg now\nOh pets largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights distance from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again\nTo pressure from Trump now we've talked about this 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we know we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we'd be that every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors in all ... there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well and\nAnd you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations\nOnly the regulations were holding us back that we would start seeing the wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThat I get I give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we ... we're we're there for you all the time mhm uh and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and couldn't convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia ... pact member I deal pact member [laughter] very avail back in the field that member right Saudi Arabia or\nTo produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we've talked about when he does extremely good things we've talked about the fact that no other there was no other Democrat courses in or the Democrats there's no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um whatever wealth starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] ... babies\nI'm One of the original chair of the original terrible [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look eventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ...\nOr ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nOnly significant concession was on automobiles and parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U.S exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there is a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to ... of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico\nMay no longer qualify for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs and will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they've said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments are they basically said it's\nThey basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by it\nAnd it's subtle along a we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wonder if you went to basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we said the auto things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income people will then was it all worthwhile", "year": "2018",
