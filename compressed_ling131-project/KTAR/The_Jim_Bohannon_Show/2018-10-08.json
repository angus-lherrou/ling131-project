you wouldn't be in the hot zones we hear their stories and then hopefully we can connect the dots in our first our make stops in Mexico and Canada\nThere is a new NAFTA deal hugely under reported of course here in the United states by the popular media and of course\nThat is also by design will hopefully started to fill in the gaps for those of you that are interested in this a monumental\nA judge to achieve bench or mistakes depending on which side you're on and we will give you a perspective is we always do a foreign perspective for an American audience so you will be hearing from uh Mexicans and Canadians in our first hour about how they are viewing this new trade deal that was one of Trump's campaign promises in his own the\nCosts it's all but officially\nA been a done also we will get global reaction to the story that again dominated\nOr not all the water cooler ... talk but all of the establishment from a Washington DC to Wall Street to New York city and are popular media and of course that is the U.S Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh this past week\nIt's always interesting to see how foreign media covered this story and they certainly did all around the globe and we will bring you some of that on the program it is election day in Brazil\nWhere the Donald Trump of Brazil is expected to win this important round it's not quite winner take all today could but most likely will not we will have reaction\nAbout what is happening in the south America's largest economy in one of the world's most influential nations it again is there another move for anti establishment Donald Trump style of politics and why does it seem to be gaining in momentum\nAgain when you look at the establishment they are telling you there's nothing to worry about in the exact opposite is happening that is also coming up on today's program very quietly and hugely under reported also in the United states the United states government is announcing a second summit between the kid dictator in North Korea and Donald Trump\nHas been set my palm pay it was just back from meeting with the kid dictator in North Korea we'll have details of that also\nAnd has Saudi

right now maybe you're in Turkey or in Saudi Arabia and you're listening to us we would like to hear reaction some of these big stories and certainly\nThey don't talk to ... that uh you know immigration that's never been a favorite of the United states so they don't even touch the subject but the actual reality you know you improve working conditions in and they go less people will be tempted uh or feel tempted to go to the United states\nNow as you know and we've talked about this since the since Trump was on the campaign trail he is still publicly saying I'm going to build a wall there's this new NAFTA deal impact the demand or the requirement for Trump to build a wall\n[noise] well no I mean that Trump says that she was talking about war during the negotiations but nothing came out of it may still firmly and saying we don't pay for any wall\nAnd supposedly Donald Trump it's uh it's about to make a major announcement on the wall during the month we'll talk dog or a nobody has said any particular date\nOr what I what ... what kind of announcement of you heard these going to make that\nNobody knows that joke that he's going to make a big announcement about the war\nSo were they different government that generationally different government led by Lopez Obrador how will ah how will he uh adopt this well he'd say oh I'm happy to take it even though I did negotiate where's he going to resist\nThe he had he had his negotiators in place you know as as a president elect he has a right to participate in the negotiations so she said delegation participate it I think the labor waveform is part of what she pushed for and he got it\nThat are as you say a campaign promise\nWatch or hay and Mexico to get us started under suspicion of voice to America a view from Mexico about Trump's new NAFTA deal also Mexico's Newt after the also Canada's new NAFTA deal are coming up in about ten minutes would go up to Canada and\nWe will hear a Canadian perspective on how they are being sold again everything's a version of the truth or we will find out the hard way is always a way it is because everybody below the president of the United states is lower on the food chain so the information is coming from the people at the very top\nAnd we'll figure it out eventually but we're going to continue to work to find out how different things are being sold interesting what Jorge said about the possibility of Trump will make what he considers to be another major announcement on the wall coming up very soon and we know that our mid term elections are now just a few weeks away also\nAnd that is another big campaign promise that a lot of folks that support Trump or looking at two\n... we're still to come also boy we will take a look at what Mike Pompeo had to say

perspective for North the border on the new NAFTA deal what it may mean\nFor you and then it is\nOf course this just a warm up for Trump's biggest trade war that's going on and that is a with China related all of that of\nCourse is is the north Korea nuclear deal and a\nChina is the key player there the trade wars are ... are integral and completely entwined with the north Korea deal that should be obvious to everybody and both sides are using it as a ... tried to use it as leverage or secretary of state Mike Pompeo I just went and had another meeting and apparently a sat down at the formal meetings and then also had a lunch\nDid some of the ... public photos in in some some talk\nWith the kid dictator in North Korea and what they are announcing it again versions of the truth this is what we get who knows what happened in that meeting but one thing that they both sides are announcing is that there's going to be a summit part to as soon as possible between the kid dictator and Trump\nAnd so that continues to show at least some momentum the big question that everybody is watching is is you know is this North Korea playing their old game which is you know sure you know we'll play nice for a little while extract some small concessions by some time and then we'll flip and then you know ... will go back to just building our nuclear weapons\nI keep in mind to the entire world is going to be watching these midterm elections coming up and seeing what happens with our Congress if it's reshaped what kind of jam all that'd be a for\nDonald Trump's a agenda of what you get when you look at Brett Kavanaugh just this past week you look at the NAFTA deal just this past week it is remarkable that he is able to fulfill are so many of his campaign promises\nA in why it is remarkable is also a testimony to how little actually gets done or the intention on the campaign trail to establishment politicians to say what they want on the on the campaign ... fully well knowing that they're never going to even attempt to follow through with this they just you know they extract that pander to\nThe minute the second the moments just grab whatever votes they can and they have no intention whatsoever to fulfilling it\nWhat is different is is that Trump's if things go I'm going to tear up NAFTA I'm going to do another deal apparently he has done that\nYeah and he says I'm going to get a conservative judges in their parent Lee He's doing that he says he's going to get a wall\nAnd we'll say we says Mexico is going to pay for it you know I doubt it but you know he says this is what he's going to do but\nHe is a he is working in in some cases succeeding in what what he campaigned with and that is hugely remarkable simply because our politicians do what we become accustomed to was what they see on the campaign trail\nIt's just folly it's just talk and uh you know the idea of actually falling through with anything just it's not even we've come to know we've come to expect none of it and they know fully well but it's just a you know it's like a game of mental masturbation that's all they're doing they're just sitting there spinning in circles blah blah blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd suddenly that has changed whether it's what'd you think is good or bad will see and that's the question what's going on with North Korea also is it a game mostly for China is it a game to actually denuclearize North Korea is North Korea happy again just to play low level low level extract small concessions\nAnd then wait for Trump either to be voted out in a couple of years or six years or the midterms jam up and they'll just play the long game\nWhen we come back we go up to Canada we find out what the Canadian stick to Justin Trudeau get bullied by Donald Trump the dairy farmers actually a concede a wire the steel tariffs still in place the candidate says it's humiliating\nBoys to America where the world comes to talk\nI'm here with her who works with my trainer Carl Chanel among\nCarl shell of longevity personal training herb I understand you have quite the story\nI've always been an active person including swimming four to five days a week a few years ago I began to experience shoulder pain to the point that I couldn't swim without any pain at all\nAfter one failed shoulder surgery I went back for a second one and even then and after seeing a physical therapist my shoulder just wasn't the same and I still couldn't get back in the pool without pain\nTime for a time out and that's it you can put in time out\nYou know you're at the bottom of the food chain and you try to you know you cry or you you know you you make it you you try to jak you become a teenager you know you get rebellious\nYeah a lot of pushback it's very difficult nothing has changed and that's what we'll do our changes hard at the top of the hour with a more of that let's go to Darren now lives in Alberta, Canada\nHe's contributed this program before he has an entrepreneur and on several businesses are chatted with him from his home right for the program about Donald Trump's and Canada's and Mexico's new NAFTA deal and asked him what the reaction was in Canada\nMost Canadians that I Know of you know they really don't think there was that much of a change um you know to see that much different than after I get those concessions we gave but I think a lot of people with some sort of Trump's rhetoric lot worry it could be a lot worse I mean that turned out to be really not that bad compared to what we already had in place\nAre you surprised that Canada was willing to sign up the way that it did after being after Mexico move first with with Trump and then they basically came back to Canada and said we've got no time left you got to get on board really quickly or not are you surprised they went along with that or was that in the plan all along\nWell again if you look at the statistics Canada realizing that states but so much was trait I forget Seventy percent of our trade I think or something like that is what the US so you know you guys aren't playing park in our economy so in some ways you know you have a ... to some degree and a logical it's\nNot much surprise that we signed by the deadline on the other hand there was also some some you know posturing back and forth but\nYour Congress I think that's the correct term was as to vote on it and they wouldn't vote on it without Canada but more I think more people thought that for sure we'd better get this deal done to post you know Trump's here's a deadline and Mexico signed him because he was such a huge trading partner I Would think that was a huge impact on the line there signed a deal out of four deadlocked\nSo the dairy industry in Canada that's been a big public issue that at least in the all the ... keep talking about\nAnd it looks like there was some movement here in the United states dairy farmers are being told that it's a better deal for them that they're going to have more access to the Canadian market and that there's been some some movement there do you see it that way or Canadian dairy farmers saying that that it's going to be a little tougher for them\n[noise] well I think of all the issues that was probably the one that got the most pressing candidate because one political party wants to get well one of the leaders of political party to watch um wants to get rid of the the dairy protectionism and Canada and the and the consumer I have no idea why the Canadians allow it to continue half the prices are so much higher than if you travel and buy\nMilk and eggs and and and butter somewhere else about one part of the most press but of course the dairy farmers are saying you know the sky is falling everything's terrible but when you look at the stats it barely changed at all\nSo that was the one in your samples laws on the bandwagon I'm all set Nicholas suggesting that we had to not allow the Americans had more access there as it turns out in the fine print that was really very little change on a little teeny bit to say that we change it but\nThat was the biggest wanting Canada that people are upset that we have to keep paying as much money as they do for for dairy\nTrump's a steel tariffs and aluminum tariffs he says they're going to stay in place for now I Know Canada publicly his continued to say that this is like an insult to you've got these close allies you mentioned huge trade partners of a ... in the defense partners for so many generations\nAnd they're they still say that this is is particularly ah insulting that Trump would keep the steel tariffs in place why is that political rhetoric or the steel terrorists\nAre are are they are they excessive to the Canadian business\n[noise] well I think that the biggest thing to look at it from a ... perspective all fairly the tariffs I think it's the premise on why they're implemented and I think I can deal with you know national interests and I commend the exact\nNational someone you probably know national security is if it's a security threat\nRight so you know everybody knows that says let's be honest with the joke and then kind of a lot of national security threat to the United states and will always been there for you know really for each other and when it comes to defense matters through last hundred years or so so\nAgain you know once the deal was signed that was kind of like washed under the rug or some type of rock and you know has really been brought up\nIs some unhappiness because you know it's a big amount of money to get the care but again once they're not to be able to find on basically just thought that they did the best thing in the world than it signed in there and you can find a candidate for the next Twenty years or so so that really even come up too much you discussions I've had with people or even the press box\nWatch Justin Trudeau how is how is he how does he come out of this\nI think somewhere in between you know every not every but I think something like a year ago and you're like a two years ago seven to ten provincial governments were liberal leaning and now it's only a couple left\nSo he's got a lot of internal problems at home with you know the tide seems to be turning a little bit more towards the great compared to the left um [noise]\nYou know again a lot of people like it or not they'll stuck up for Trudeau\nNo matter what the deal is really scientifically Trump like oh shit\nYeah a lot of people were never going to forget some of the things that were said and bullying tactics that Trump was good at doing\nSo I think he gets sort of a free coughing Canada more than anything letter ... politically just because of you know people knew that Iraq against Trump can you hear so unpredictable you know what the hell is going to say an extra two so that I think helped a lot in his arms of Trump's no negotiating style in public\nYou know that's kind of the big thing that everybody is discussing here which is could this this NAFTA deal\nBe a practice round for the bigger trade deal which would be the United states and China is that the take away after all this the Trump is is a bully and a and and uh an unfair in the way that he approaches a negotiations\nI think that was good and the Senate before it was fine but then once it was fine and start looking at each of the small details it really didn't change a lot or is it like you know the most thinks he didn't really come through on\nThat he you know kind of mentioned in public or lacrosse like coca theory again and again I don't remember the percentage but it it was barely changed all the parts of NAFTA about but once they get on how you know get the\nThe biggest protection of the world like a stereo all this but at the end of the day the details say change much so um that's\nWhy again like he was a boy and the traffic and you know he's on earth rocks all that\nStuff and that's why one of the world's total comes out on top as far as well\nAt least he signed a deal and he's dealing with Trump and and that's something else you've been to China even in the new NAFTA um you know now we have to be very careful about trading partners because we can't do deals with China and that's actually been in the press quite a bit is how what kind of you know ... second guessed by the Americans\nBecause we now have to get their approval ... deals with countries like China so that's actually caught a pass or more than anything because it was on\nLast time we talked with you you told us a little bit about one of the businesses that you have it was a coffee business and how just the last year the uncertainty in the negotiations going on with all three North American countries\nHad a impacted the way that that you chose to do business now that this deal looks to be just about done well are you continuing to to do a pivot in and change the way you're doing business with some of your business is\nWell I think I Am a little bit maybe I have an unfair advantage because I went to Mexico for a number of years are different businesses and now just maybe open my eyes a little more to say hey you don't want to look around him down in Mexico I anyway so I'm not sure the average Canadian with you that there hasn't been us but because I travel throughout the world will open some ranchers maybe\nI'm just a little more prone to doing it but ever since they say it's definitely getting any more of an awareness to say you know like what you look out you know poke around more not necessarily good or bad or the United states but just you know it's a big world and why don't look around more\nAs Darren in Canada for us with his analysis of the new NAFTA deal before that we had

thinks about you and the issues that are important to you we hopscotch around the globe doctor regular people just like you and me and the hot zones\nWe hear their stories and then hopefully we can connect the dots as you just heard by the ... sound or indeed it is time for the change of heart segment this has put together and produced by the crack staff a voice to America led by vice president of technology and certified millennial a Adam\nGood morning and today the program we'll be\nChanges heart a F. and a full disclosure I just learned the meeting of a F within the last what six to twelve ... you had to explain that to one of these millennial terms\nF a we're a family program of course we'll keep it at a F word on\nCNN for instance a day that\nBut today I'm seeing a a A R C a change of heart CIA H. A. F.\nWe will hear from a venerable a popular journalist\nTed Koppel yep this is this kind of interesting now anybody under the age of thirty five you know who Ted Koppel is yeah for Nightline right yeah but that was I mean that's when I was a kid he was I mean yeah he hasn't been on when you were like two he was on\nBut this is still when a popular electronic media still had a semblance of credibility you know they still try to be that or even try any more I mean as we've said it's fun and it's fun for entertainment purposes but I mean they you know this is that that was it um\nAnd so you do what you do know who he is well yeah yeah or if he's like eighty years old though he's been retired for a good ten or Fifteen Years\nOn you know his heyday was really the eighties and end of the nine or ... by two thousand and he was the right way past just prime and you know the anchorman Ron Burgundy completely taken over electronic journalism and that's a good Twenty years ago it was already jumping to Charlotte so we'll hear from him today\nWe will also hear from a one of the favorites of the program not Philip Mudd but Don Lemon\nAnd this is interesting because you are\nThe shows the extent when we say we spare no expense we go to all links to a helping this time of Donald Trump Brett Kavanaugh of Brexit um and we said look this is our public service sector\nWhere we know we recognize we're doing it for the kids we recognize that literally not only half of the United states but half of the world is a show tricks\nDid they cannot function any longer and then the other half is saying look we we do the change happens in life where we've got to figure out the best way to do it it's like anything else you know you get hired and fired from a job you're businesses go boom they go bust you get married you get divorced you you know a family members are healthier than they die I mean this is this is part of life\nAnd you have to figure out the best way to navigate so half the people say I'm going to do the very best I can to try to work and prepare for it in anticipation the other half is just pick plus the hat and drugs and we go into a corner\n[laughter] that's the that's the other partner that's fine that's really where we are in in ... but then there's the of the different folks are trying to figure out I mean ... that's why we do the changes are because what we correctly and every day now think about when we started this ... the changes are segment\nOf not swearing on their right making sure that people don't swear on human resources director for on airs preserve the standard and called journalistic standards and quality of CNN correct okay so this is from two thousand Fifteen oh go ahead and played it\nAll I Want to get this from media and he says total both\nBS excuse me yeah total BS pardon me I did not mean that I can I said\nThat's where two thousand Fifteen yeah he says he says the word the U.S we we do we do the beeping program he apologized immediately apologized so what we've seen now is is that he was to get will give them the benefit of the doubt back to you let it slip but then apologized and said that wasn't meant to come out this is not what we do on this program\nTo this you found just what five days ago in day six days ago six days ago same guy same channel same show three years later go ahead and play to\nThis went on after the show and people wanted to get up including us because we didn't want to let them that both\nYeah and we picked it up yeah we did so that's the key point and we've been saying this forever to is there was a shift around two thousand Fifteen with Donald Trump started a campaign in Bay CNN still says their policy is no swearing on the air\nBut then that happened but we kept noticing and saying they keep telling us there's no swearing they don't support this family program gold standard journalism it specifically that word be as we said you can just CBS we all know what it means there's absolutely no reason\nTo say the whole world other than they get into chase ratings to chase ratings you could leverage it into that a for instance here over just the last two years this is all CNN program and go ahead\nHe had spent his whole life but\nHe has succeeded by both putting his garden the presidency by both thing it's very hard to tell somebody at that point the boats that doesn't\nWork and I find that a lot of hunting I Am a proud ... colors and built this country a hundred and ten years ago they were called ...\nGeorge Tenet is a first generation Greek I guess he's a ... and we're learning the same lessons that we learned when we called the Chinese Man a guy when we called the man from Guatemala is going to [noise]\nAnd we call a black man in [noise]\nOkay um\nAnd yet they say the standards are no shared at very high and here you go from two thousand Fifteen he was apologizing now there's no apology we did all the ... by the way that the point of this is we'd be put out because\nLike why can't like there's a thousand Fifteen lemon we say look we don't we this is these are our stance we choose not to do that on there but they now they're out there doing it in a while they're doing that they're saying we're not we're not doing it they're they're doing it and then telling you were not doing it\nBrian filter saying thirty percent increase in ratings doesn't matter doesn't matter how does this model\nBut it's this kind of stuff that's gotten in the ratings ... of course it so this is what I'm saying we don't do that go out there right now I'm aware and look I'm open to the possibility that\nMaybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong maybe it really is something else but I've seen no evidence to indicate that I'm wrong but I'm open to it and if somebody wants to make a convincing argument please do\nWe keep finding this and saying it doesn't make you know if somebody says we don't swear and then they swear ... that's not convincing to me that ... that you're right and wrong stealing your wallet hell but I I've been to understanding\nOr something else but you've got to make a convincing argument if I'm not one that just as they say therefore I Believe it's like you say something you've got to give me some some something to back it up you've got to give me at least common sense to back it up if not hard

tuned into the change is hard segment that will be archived you can rely on their share to if you wish you the kind of got\nMultiple global media spotlights more on our lead story which is the new NAFTA deal between Trump Canada and Mexico we've already given your reaction from some of our voices both north and south of the United states I was in our first our work on this program and you can go back and re listen or listen to it for the first time if you missed it\nBut we'll have more on how Canadian media covered the story also there it is a first round a presidential elections in Brazil\nLargest economy largest nation in Latin America and it appears that the Trump of Latin America is poised to wind down there\nAnd do we will ask the obvious questions again and start looking at it if we are being told by the institutions that Trump\nIs bad ... is bad five star movement is bad Marine Le pen is bad you're builders is bad a but\nEither the their momentum continues to grow or they're outright wins what in the world is going on somebody can't be telling the truth\nAnd we'll continue to examine that on a global basis and find out the Trump is truly are uniquely American phenomenon which I have always argued that it isn't and if you listen to this program you know exactly why because we only talked to people outside of the United states and they said you guys it's not a phenomena as a matter of fact you're behind the curve\nIn places around the world what happened here in the United states with our last presidential election I've been going on a lot longer outside\nThe United states and they certainly saw it coming but we'll be talking about that a developing story that we will continue to follow for you to is is that a Saudi journalist and a former advisor are critical to the Saudi monarchy\nA has somehow disappeared in Turkey\nAnd he went into a constantly building the Saudi constantly building in Istanbul\nThis this is according to the Turkish government and somehow disappear\nNow the allegations are a range from he disappeared we don't know where he is too he was murdered inside the constantly but this was a public narrative that is being pushed from turkey all the way up to president early on there and of course the larger question is this is a version of the truth all of it as version of the truth\nBut what is behind all of this if the allegations are true those are bad enough but if it's coming from the highest levels of power from Saudi Arabia to turkey considering what we do know about those governments\nIt is much bigger than just one man even if he wasn't journalist and critic of the Saudi Government to America where the world comes to talk [noise]\nTo Arizona is news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F. M. K. T. A. R. dot com and streaming live on that Katie a our news\nToday I'm here with herb works with my trainer Carl shell of longevity personal training herb I understand you have quite the story\nI've always been an active person including swimming four to five days a week a few years ago I began to experience shoulder pain to the point that I couldn't swim without any pain at all\nAfter one failed shoulder surgery I went back for a second one and even then and after seeing a physical therapist my shoulder just wasn't the same and I still couldn't get back in the pool without pain\nOr a little bit more than ... authoritative than their actual action on the ground but nonetheless\nHe is title is president of a Interpol which I'm finding out is more of a ceremonial role than an actual you know I'm I'm a tough this street leather shoe leather cop who's out there\nGetting the bad guys around the globe but he is also security official and he's not young he's in his mid sixties who has worked inside China and remain and maintains that I mean just stop and think about that for a second\nHow do you become president of Interpol while maintaining a high security position for the government of China I mean that's not a conflict of interest what is I mean this is this this is the point of institutions there's all kinds of conflicts of interest and why is it follow\nThe money don't don't follow social justice don't follow you know I Believe that may be in their down low or in the middle but follow the money for us but nonetheless\nIt's interesting story is just like so many a prominent people recently in China or where Xi Jinping is basically consolidated his power over the last year or two and become emperor\nAnd a ... in in ... and again history tells us what happens with that uh he was in China flew into China from his home in France ... where he lives were Interpol is is based and uh and they disappeared\nAnd apparently he knew about it it's suspected that something could happen and so he had his wife in kind of on the deal and saying you know if I don't show up or if I don't call or something like this I sense that I might be in danger which begs the question why are you going back of your life is in danger\nWhat China is now confirmed is is that he is being detained\nStill alive being detained nobody's heard from 'em but China at least invest that again there's some anti new anti corruption laws and he is being questioned uh in that we've seen actresses\nYou know in in China the their their version of Hollywood starlet they have been detained they disappear for a while nobody hears from and then suddenly they reappear and make the public apology and say oh I did wrong and I'm paying this fire I'm doing whatever and she's been paying his great he's he's you know like the kid dictator we're starting to see this\nAgain ah what just commonsense tell us when you consolidate power in a communist country or any country but in this case it historically communist country and then you see something where the very top consolidates even more power than what you've seen in recent decades\nOr you're going to you know expect these types of moves where they're going to start rounding up people and they're going to create new laws that nobody knows about people are gonna be disappeared and then suddenly they come back and they're like oh I Love the dear leader version paying and I'm going to pay this fine and name\nThe bigger question is one of the western institutions do because if you've got a guy who's part of an eastern institution a communist government and then he's also the head at least ceremony or the ... of ... a western institution based in France the democracy all of that\nMore pressure on institutions this is\nTo to me and nobody will say this nobody will see it this way is it is in another great wide open example of western institutions\nUnder attack under pressure and you know the strongman guys like ... the powerful vision paying hamper kid dictator now under the Brazilian elections\nUh this is a country that\nHas huge corruption problems which is nothing doesn't certainly make them exclusive to or any other country but nonetheless\nBrazil is a significant power not only in Latin America but around the globe economically also a and this is the guy that this band that we are going to hear this global media spotlight about both Inara was the candidate they call them the Trump of Latin America or the Trump of Brazil he was the guy that was out campaigning publicly and got stabbed in the stomach\nAnd has recovered uh let's see how this is being Rick ... covered this is from a ... the CNN of the middle east again showing you\nHow a media here in the United states are very myopic if you've been following anything over the last three or four weeks it's Brett Kavanaugh all the time only time that's the only store they can cover we got nothing on NAFTA\nWe got nothing on NAFTA we can do this for you today we're trying to get ... you know this Interpol chief Brazilian elections here we go portions on voice ...\nMost NATO has been described by some as Donald Trump meets Philippine president Rodrigo do ... and the light that he's turned the mainstream media into is useful enemy both NATO at the ten point lead in the poll in a country whose traditional parties have been sustained by scandal\nA populist outsider has moved into the political vacuum\nOur starting point this week is one of the primary battle ground in this election is social media space in Brazil\nSo say they are going to war\nWithout feel to enter the all the time I talked to him but also they don't fight them and they don't think that what the us and then you have to\nVote for NATO spent years in the national assembly as a fringe politician before becoming a leader of a relatively small party which he's taken to the writer despite being the victim of a damning last month from which he says he's still recovering\nHis critics called him homophobic thoughtfulness both for NATO some supporters are there don't find any of those things\nWhen they're reported on mainstream news because millions are getting their news straight from the camp\nOn what south or from his supporters\nWho he was not the one to build the Internet as a medium to propagate the political campaign that one but two for the conservative who found in the Internet's a medium to exchange information without\nPutting their personal security any danger that you need to be seen in the ideas that are so not a managed to integrate into his campaign or does it will ... sensors on social media and only unlike what's happens on the mainstream media today where he has no voting\nLike happening but I think is that social media is taking a cat and I said\nI said south [noise] outside the suffering and no matter how we\nCan question that they can basically of which there support this\nAnd they can counteract what's happening even though there\nIs some information available that\nTheir members of the loop\nFor sex to believe what their own tiny they ... that people supporting a candidate I say everything that goes against what they've been ... ... ...\nOh that's quite looking out for me to cover the Brazilian elections notice to whether you want to say look I Believe what's going on there I don't but this uh open campaign has been going on for quite a long time just like the most open societies you there's lots of public rallies there's lots of chances to to follow\nAnd ... ... ...\nHere in the United states we were told you two years ago a guy like Donald Trump can't make it and then he makes it in its own some type of a mistake\nOr and then if we just get rid of them are reverse it it's the same thing going on with ... were in ... people are still saying we're we just need to overturn it we just due to overturn it so the two and a half years we just need to take another vote and we get rid of it we can just go back to being normal what we continue to document for you on this program because we looked so far outwardly\nIs that this is not some story about a guy that saying oh you know we've got to forget Donald Trump in the elections under the guy that has the most traction going on right now is a guy that is clearly\nMimicking what Donald Trump in the breakfast folks did and he's getting traction\nYeah so the opposition say oh you're crazy or that can't be but then we keep seeing it we keep seeing it and we keep seeing it whether it's in Italy whether it's in Hungary whether it's in Germany\nYou know with these big open western societies we keep seeing evidence of it if not outright wins momentum and ... and ... momentum grows it doesn't doesn't decrease\nAnd yet all of our institutions tell us that's not going to happen\nOver and over and over again it's not going to happen it's not going to happen there's something wrong with the of the voters there's something wrong with the system they must not have tallies the votes correctly or a Russia must have manipulated this\nUh it's over and over again I can I can assure you that in the United kingdom they still establishment these tablets are still saying\nThere's a chance that we can just get rid of go back to and a half years ago and just reverse it because it was a mistake that vote that referendum by the citizens it must have been a mistake or literally it must have been a day in which everybody wasn't thinking clearly\nThe best we can still reverse breakfast and then of course the the carrot and all this is and then we're going to go back to where we were before which is so great for everybody\nStill going on\nAt least story was NAFTA the new NAFTA Donald Trump or just about I mean still has to get congressional ratification but just about\nA fulfilling another one of his campaign promises and of course we took a look took a look at it from the Mexican side and the Canadian side with some of our voices if you missed the show will be archived you can go back and you can listen to it but how did foreign media covered this story here in the United states nobody covered it I

Sunday Morning talk shows yesterday some we'll hear from him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witness was back again and everything else that would be interesting from what is is especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nUh women who met allegations are against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go to the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nYeah and he's on the Supreme Court to stay yes and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it they it there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it and if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the or the house yeah it's\nOnly really uh they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and give people a motivated you get to the polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or\nNot ah my I guess my question would be isn't a motivator to get Republicans out or is this because we can we we've seen it I probably in the past I Can't think offhand of\nOf of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once that happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a\nAnger here and a unity remember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party that was split and and I don't believe this is just about\nCapital I think it is about the fact that\nYou have the as I've said why'd I think we're Washington Examiner said\nA a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter and a half a Democrat but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is uh right now and\nThis and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey've listened to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to it you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThat are talking insane ... they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional issues that are just so important to so many of us are presumption of ... of of of innocence\nYeah and it's just driving the Republicans crazy for video world log here's your forecast\nBegin a week with a very active weather map there are at least three other systems in the north Atlantic that are being monitored by the national Hurricane Center but we're focus now on tropical storm Michael expected to bring to the north eastern Gulf Coast by mid week the risk of dangerous storm surge\nRainfall wind impacts continue to increase will see at least tropical storm force winds arrive by tomorrow night\nFrom an area basically from west of Tallahassee into the New Orleans area but most of South Florida can expect some ...\nOf all there is a tough pollen in the New York times today than that attacks you I Want to put something up Frank Bruni writes I Can't think of another Republican whose journey from anti Trump outraged approach from\nUps equally as soon as was quite so illogical or half a sad end he suggests that you are auditioning\nFor a play is Jeff Sessions as attorney general you're a sponsor\nA Frank you don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to the storage additional candidate whose conservative whether the Thomas lido more now Cavanaugh I'm bipartisan when it makes sense [noise]\nUh I Try to have a good disposition costs like my job but don't mistake that I don't care\nAbout the conservative cause so if I made you upset because how well not generalize McCarthyism\nThing good and I think I can survive in South Carolina is\n\nWell you know the thing is is that um I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he really thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second\nOf all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage\nThat he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day I think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried through and that attitude needs to be carried\nThrough a on important things that that ah that matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kinds of other nomination process we may go through\nA while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point or the left was going to\nYou know they used to him when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president\nAnything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left wanted to use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be\nThe by porters and willing to cross the Ohio Republican that John McCain was\nAnd in some ways he was but of course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and your outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bernie's column and the New York times that none of it relates to the actual case and what he was talking about there is it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and\nYou know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called the names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore [laughter]\nSomehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean I did it change\nDoesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\nIt really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that\nAnd I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham but Lindsey Graham's a when he issued his concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the ... and on the larger a much to a larger than\nA pretty much the treatment of capital by the Democrats and and not the not the liberals with the signs outside look right the Democrats on the committee\nFrank Bruni has nothing to the article he's got nothing while he's you're angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said\nWe discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any rational thought were critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats\nJust say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed\nAt all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case with this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every single\nEvery single point that we have made\n\nWhich are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drop them nuts and moral and correct and right and you're wrong and reading Frank Bruni column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by\nPoint and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be the line\nAt them I mean it is again a the they just lack the will to have the debate they don't have the debate cannot the debate so they ... and ... what Lindsey Graham said on that day\nSo they do what well\nHe used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominees that's that's a good nomination pick over there I like that I don't like this\nReal people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bruni can do that\nI can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham yeah and I might in the future you are you running for attorney general right [laughter] what ... what are you trying to get out of ... ... well that's it\nHe's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's for Trump\nWe've we've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple and arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that\nAren't aren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\nAnd you read British telling me like what about the allegations made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump's fought to become attorney general yeah\nYou have no evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because he was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with the Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is aguaje yes\nYeah it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the site that had the greater intellect\n[laughter] I don't tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump and now he likes Trump\nDebate him on the point made on that day Mr Bruni can't can't do it eight six six Ninety road I\nCook
