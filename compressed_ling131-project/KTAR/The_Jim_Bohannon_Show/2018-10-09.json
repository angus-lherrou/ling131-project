okay to ... so that kind of a thing a thing coming back to ... about thirty thousand others\nAnd one paid by the guy that I thought the name of the show and ever since I've been doing better than ... feeling really bad about it because you know want to say that you should never get into the factory or they\nKnow how can I help you today sure\nYeah so my question and I have a couple of course and the one thing I said\nWhat's your household income Seventy five so if I Do it and you make thirty are you oh thirty I'm sure you're oh thirty oh yeah oh yeah where you are quick you're going to pay it off\nWe are quick you're going to pay it off\nI mean if I leave with my mom like greeted with it and maybe I maybe I don't know how\nThank you for joining us on the Jesus is with us in Los Angeles time a gene how are you\nAre you better than I deserve what's up\nTalking a psychologist or just come back right after the shopping [laughter] so um I graduated high school a few years ago and I decided to go to community college in community college um I work I went to a\nWork [laughter] um I did about like thirty hours a week for the community college and it wasn't an issue and now I transferred to a university I'm In my first semester right now I'm In classes are you um you know it's a little bit harder\nSo my question what do you think I should quit my job and focus more on school for the last two years do you\nThink I should just I'm just trying hardest and uh ... what are you studying accounting\nOkay I've got a finance degree and I worked forty to sixty hours a week while I went through school and for years and at the university level so I'm a it's doable um you are you know you are doing a lot of studying and not a lot of partying for sure oh I'm the I'm how are you paying for school\nUm I go to I get grants and now for um ... the money for\nOkay so you're you're not going into debt\nNo yellow okay\nSo if you quit work how would you pay for school\nI had a money saved up from a working for the past year I don't mind my thing I think it will probably like call of mhm oh you left me a year year and a half no I think I keep working okay\nIf it ... last year if it costs you a half a point when your grade point average um\nYeah I heard about it like cheap yeah\nYeah I graduated with a two non seven\n\nI missed it as a magnet by a missed making about ... still piss Thirty years later but [laughter]\nBut you know what I have never had a single caller asked my GPA before they asked my advice [laughter]\nAnd I actually I've never gone on a job interview where they asked my GPA in my entire life ever in if you're willing to go to work for one of the\nTop accounting firms in the entire world they might ask your GPA and you might actually be in competition or GPA might actually matter on your very first job but after that it won't um and it it has a whole lot more to do with did you learn how to do accounting than what your GPA is and will you work hard while you're at work and that kind of stuff\nAnd so what are you doing for work right now\nUh I work at a bank mhm okay good\nOkay a poke around in the accounting field and see if you can get on with one of them making about the same kind of money one of them might actually be a four year degree\nYeah that's what I was thinking too\nYeah wouldn't hurt anything to ask around and see if you can make a job James and make about the same money and get free tuition or something that'd be very cool\nOn top of it but I'm I'm\nYou know you're not working a hundred hours a week working thirty hours a week twenty hours a week you can do this it's very doable and most people work when they're in school it's not that unusual\nReally by the way when I when I Do and I was in\nI was just in San Francisco this week and we're doing an event we should ... ... the audience were three thousand people there how many have you work when you were in college I mean it's like Ninety percent of the audience raise their hand\nNow maybe the people that didn't work when they're in college and listen to my show I don't know but it appears that most people work when they're in college that's what it looks like and so um I I think if I'm you I'm going to continue that route good question thank you for joining us a ... is with us in Houston Hi Lucia how are you\nHow I Am doing well thank you ... and I hope I get back on here and I had been an eyelash babysat ... getting out at that rally ... called me and them for a down payment on our ... ... adults that we're looking right now at about a\nGreat thing about them I frequent down um our household income before\nUm sonics back when he was about one twenty five an afterthought Knesset move cycles app one thirty two and so I'm trying to make sure that I like them about like how much how I um\nI ... and that we are understanding the average\n[noise] I I I think you recommend and afford to have your take home pay exactly at okay and so I wanted to make sure that like right now where I pay with a million markets calculator and right now we're kind of had a funny one country um I have a badge\nOn and kept up like a reasonable comfortable amount house on a fair number have little or\nNo it was big now that it's a lot better when you're paying now but if that's that's a fourth of your take on pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the math spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that the most\nYou should do so you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put on a shorter term if you want to and you know I'm about\nLess house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with Bert on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow\nMoney at all for anything ever is a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay Luke is whether it's in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the day Ramsey show\nID very better than I deserve what's up [noise] so\nUm my wife and I have a rich moved to you for many years actually I my dad got me let's see what I was a young kid and I'm like stupidly I did not take her by her and I have to do and um we we are considering taking a cash out refinance our house\nTo a knockout the high interest you know ... and ... are paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much they want to get your mind certain loan but you know she um read it forty eight thousand drank and what's your household income\n[noise] fluctuate between takeover forty to sixty show on my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably doing I'm probably going to bring culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in a twenty six years I've never told someone to refinance\nActually take care of to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure and you're facing neither ... show on now I I've never told anybody that\nOkay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years um you've got to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life but then you're going to be debt free except your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm\nFrom there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be groups but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nWe're going to go in and also fast it's like you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful where Donald in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can with your business to increase your income because you need to clean up a student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of there and work to get big your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron excitement that we all make which I'm digging out a whole you're not digging out of hope you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper\nAnd she can't dig out of all you have to fill in the whole I get to climb out of a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China and work so no you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nLittle on the sand and say well now borrowing money\nEver ever ever\nDishes that I ...\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing\nFrom listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare\nI don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team\nCome out with Romney where you were how what light bulb moment that you have a ha moment where you ... oh\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of an\n'cause we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much did everybody had\nAnd were like wow like you know there's a support group and you know this is a great way would start with the baby steps ... and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just Kickstarter bizarro intensity and it really helps how much uh we had about ten thousand and so\nThat was hard for a nerd was Raja check it out and\nClean up as soon as it\nTakes your breath away so Veronica spend or go to class you go to class but then you get in there and there had to be a moment where you go oh I'm sure I like this ...\nWell it wasn't so much\nThat I didn't like it I just I felt like\nI needed like I said strategies to help me because I I didn't want to be in that either and I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway ban where you went oh I see that now\nEverything about it was awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles\nAnd and with him being there that he is and then me and just coming to my senses and saying you know is this is this material things something that I really need to have\nUsing the ... system really helped me\nAnd I'm not out our budget and ... this is the amount of money we need to pay for our groceries says you know this is how much we we can get to the church and this is how much we can give people for gifts and whatnot and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those steps\nYou know we're just looking\nAround a little bit like ritual ritual group little budget is permission to spend\nI Love your daughter permission to spend okay yeah yeah and that's exactly what it is I never sometimes when I just felt like\nWe didn't have any money and that's the mindset I had to get myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we want it ... you know when I'm On a budget\nBut once I set about whether control me I don't know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader when your brother was a cheerleader and you had the community that you've got plugged into Richard leaders who else would your biggest cheerleader\nAnd uh I mean we're really close to our family and my family they're\nAll of them are very supportive of us we we both come from five brothers are\nNot five ...\nFive kids from each family so two brothers and sisters so we have we come from a big family but and they were all supportive of us really in our friends and as well so\nSo what do you tell people to key to getting out of that is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ...\nYou know communication is key and you know we went to the money and marriage last week and we were listening to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial peace but they've gone through a lot of seminars ... and I think if they had gone through a seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page\nAnd it would just really explode once they get through that and and follow the ... the steps yeah and just\nYou know riding down our goals was really important for us to do and once we had that you know are very cool driven and especially being in sales jumped you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and so just staying focused and dedicated and discipline I'm really really helped us\nWealth on you guys from Bert proud of you very well done your shrunk couple a lesson Rachel at the marriage money thing or it's but virtually stand up comedy 'cause they're both a book

... ... [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell come back to the gym haven't showed one eight six six five oh jumbo when they've six six\nFive oh five or six to six our guest is Dave workman senior editor at the gun at ... dot com and we're taking a look\nAt things that are might possibly come before new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh including mainly gun issues in this particular instance in that scenario of course where there have been many many resounding battle that has occurred at the Supreme Court Charles calls in from Springfield, Missouri this evening hello Charles\n[noise] Hi there how you doing Mr Bannon I'm fine thank you [noise] um I was listening and I you know you hit on a topic that's always been a kind of a hot button for me and that is how\nThe liberals always do get these ideologues that you know completely side with them but the um you know people get\nBored you know anytime that a conservative tries to get someone that really is on their side and not some halfway you know a ...\nA you know the Democrats are an absolute fit the we the the conservatives do nothing they they have constantly there the the party of appeasement and they need someone to discuss some fight and then in just says no we're we're going to fight for this\nCan we just haven't seen it I mean I look at the Democrats and how they treated cabinet and that'd be despicable and either party however why don't we ever fight\nFight they put up\nYeah well that's a that's a good point out what our guest to address that I certainly agree with the Charles uh\nAbsolutely uh Dave in regard to the motion of the next time there's a a a Democratic president if they put up a liberal justice so we start coming up with the stories about how they uh they uh they litter or have overdue parking tickets or what have you I think that that is a ... noted that disgusting practice\nBut uh I was wondering uh have Republicans fought hard enough regarding some of the more liberal a recent pick say for example a Brock Obama's pick some of which I I think sailed a ride through I mean it seems to be Republicans tend to follow the the the victim\nIt's the president's choice when it's a nominee as qualified I can go with it whereas Democrats followed the victim uh I disagree with that person therefore anything and everything is fair game\nWell I I think if you look at it from the perspective of Republican credit full of the constitution a little bit more than the Democrats do\nAt least in this issue and and the the or a collegial bunch of people which I'm not too sure that pays off in a more collegial being college oldest work too well when you were in a bar fight\nAnd that's what we just witness frankly you know I I remember back when I was in high school and we talked about all this stuff in American government and and you know I had some good teachers back then people who were really afraid\nThere weren't really afraid to ah to speak out call a spade a spade and say look you know if people do this but it's wrong it's not the government is supposed to work now days or ... it's almost like a a a pitch battle you know a food fight\nAnd what they tried to do to Britain cabinet or the Democrats\nAre with this eleventh hour Hail Mary thing bringing up a um [noise] uh the forward accusations and and and frankly I have a lot of sympathy for I think she got thrown under the bus a fifth of the dogs the ... just in order to uh to try to derail Kavanaugh's nomination\nUh they were both ... and it would probably be the the Republicans now especially if they retain control on Capitol Hill after November\nTo launch some investigations into just how did that become public or what we witnessed with the judge cab mental justice Cabot all or was it just deplorable if not despicable\nAnd ah you know I wrote about this I've covered this thing for liberty per person the gun Meg and I'm going to continue to cover it\nBecause I think what happened there was wrong and and certainly the polls seem to be indicating that to the public is just roiled up this really has fired up the Republican base I think\nIt's bringing people out to vote who probably wouldn't have voted at the midterms but Jim they're angry and and they have some people that they were angry at they can identify the people that they're really mad at me and I kinda think the Democrats are they might have blown this\nOne well we'll see you certainly both bases seemed to be quite fired up we'll see who does the turnout trick the best Sharon ingrained Missouri yellow\nVarying I can um you know I Hope that justice Kavanaugh\nJust vote the constitution that but I Want to get today I don't want them to make I don't want them to be the best on the court I why ... pilot okay\nFor some time not going to be happy with that although it may go against something that I think back in ... and then I Will I Will abide by ... and support it I hired\nThis\nCork a making law than they are not supposed to do that that is Congress' job and I want everybody to do their job Congress to do their job presidents that guy and they did they show branch to do their\nCan for those in the judicial branch who do not do their job or I Would keep in mind one thing uh Sharon and I'll just notice do today was well you look at the constitution that information constitution\nOf the house is spelled out in the constitution the Senate\nThe president's either the chief executive officers the cabinet heads in the like and then you come of course to the article three the judicial branch of that is is particularly interesting because it says the judicial power of the United states shall be vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such inferior records as we Congress may from time to time ordain and establish that is to say all of the appellate courts the disc records are creations of Congress Congress can simply repeal any of those courts anytime it so chooses Dave\n[noise] yeah and I think we also know if you if you study the laws really will judges are on the lower federal courts in and there's even been some mention nothing but ... in New York\nThey had to that is the liberal democratic congressman going\nOn yeah and it it he's apparently already talking about a trend to I'm a recall or get rid of justice Kavanaugh you\nOnly do that by impeaching him convicted\nI Know and and and just you know impeachment is just ... that came right out of left field but I think that shows just how extremist some of these people really are on the D side of the aisle and the country is looking at this and they don't like it\nNo I'm I'm sure they don't and I'm sure this appeals to the base which increasingly has to have Democrats rather nervous or after what happened to Joe Crowley the New York other New York congressman but again keep in mind as in the case of the presidency\nIf the Democrats get so much as a bare majority in the house yes I'm sure the articles of impeachment against the Donald Trump and possibly Kavanaugh they'll never get sixty seven votes in the Senate to convict so it's not something that I'm going to lose any sleep over\nYou back and just a moment Arizona's

there's a silent mask free treatment option available right here in Phoenix and Tucson it's called inspire\nDid this the tough questions but I frankly I think\nWe just witnessed with the cabinet or a confirmation process the rules just got changed even even Senator Lindsey Graham who is\nTypically a laid back guy he ... his things were out the other day he was\nFurious at his Democratic colleagues are on the Senate Judiciary committee and I don't think that's going to go away I think they changed the rules and you know what they're going to have to live with that for a very long time in ... when Republicans\nCome back and say there is a Democrat is president uh sometime the next four to eight years and we'll see how that works out uh if if if someone is nominated\nTo a vacancy on the high court I think the gloves could easily come back off again and and what is what good does it do for the country I don't know I don't know what some of these people are thinking\nWell I I I can tell you what some of them are thinking and then we'll take a quick break your but a lot of Democrats are really running very scared right now the below happened to them is the same as what happened to Joe Crowley the prominent or a Democratic House member many thought might may be a successor to Nancy Pelosi has Democratic House leader beaten by this Alexandria\nOcasio Cortez\nWho doesn't know as much as they used to pick to pass in eighth grade civics class back when they had such things\nAnd just just cleaned his clock\nAnd now you've got to of course Dianne Feinstein let's not forget her situation in California because of that law out there where everybody runs in one primary and the top two finishers\nAutomatically go on the ballot in November which means that the Republicans this year have nobody on the ballot for Senate you've got Feinstein the incumbent and you've got a Democrat even further to the left than she is and the California Democratic party endorsed her opponent\nA lot of these Democrats I think in their heart of hearts are probably not thrilled with this but first and foremost they want to keep their jobs and they are running hard scared because of their own left to just imagine a state in which\nDianne Feinstein is considered just a little too conservative we'll be back and just a moment\n... theory or through a deer\nRecovered it talked to farmers we

Dave work many senior editor at the gun ... dot com we're looking at possible Second Amendment issues which could come before the Supreme Court\nNow than it has it's night justice Brett Kavanaugh who officially shows up for work tomorrow today being a Columbus Day a federal holiday now this was what ... going back to the D.C versus Heller\nA decision and this is what a judge Kavanaugh had to say in the twenty eleven\nIn and I'm quoting here from a cabinet position and disapproving D.C.'s ban on handguns in approving a ban on machine guns and in approving longstanding regulations such as concealed carry a felon in possession laws\nHeller established the scope of the second Amendment rights and plus the constitutionality of gun bans on regulation is determined by reference to text history and tradition\nUnquote Brett Kavanaugh as an appellate court judge seven years ago or your your thoughts about that as a as a a philosophy going forward Dave\n[noise] well I think that it is one of the keys to white Dianne Feinstein and some colleagues were just going berserk over the idea of a cabinet or a sending to the Supreme Court\nAh I think he looks at the historic\nA way that firearms have really been a part of the American fabric uh you know we talked earlier about a\nA law enforcement and and how the country didn't really have a law enforcement until the early Eighteen hundreds and I checked the Texas Rangers\nOr were formed Eighteen twenty three places\nAustin now All right I'm\n... the idea that uh one of the constitution was written\nA it was commonplace for people walk around in the village they they'd go to trade they do think they had a firearm without a and it might have been a Flynn lock or or abrasive pistols or something but they had guns with them\nEverybody behaved ... most people behave themselves\nAnd uh I think he looks at the historic context of how firearms were were really part of the ... the American fabric and and how we advance as a country he also said something in in that ruling into this little Evan\nThat because semi automatic pistols or protect her so also should be semi automatic rifles\nAnd you know that's in some of the Democrats into orbit\nThey'll try it out the term that they could define that their lives depend on what about assault rifles and now I can define an assault rifle for you right now and that is it's a it's black and sinister looking it may have a pistol grip that that's an assault rifle go ahead\nUh yeah I think you just paint that because quite frankly the term is an invention by the the the gun prohibition lobby it and you know they this dates back I didn't twenty five thirty years\nWe've got to demonize these things and and really make people think that their machine guns and this was the strategy back then and when when Dianne Feinstein opened her questioning\nOf a judge Kavanaugh\nOr the first thing she turned to was guns and and the ... he is a a dissenting opinion which really was in two thousand eleven and what he said about semi automatic rifles\nAnd and then she said something that just is bizarre I called her on this in print she said what about the hundreds of school shootings that we've had over the years involving assault rifles that was just hogwash\nAnd I don't know where she gets the stuff but the too many in the media especially the median ... bill

talked to John proud about\nHurricane Michael a a a coming in we had a discussion on on on Hurricane Florence ... you and I talked to briefly not we didn't spend a lot of time on it about\nThe Washington Post piece remembered that said the Trump Administration was complicit in that in right in the in Hurricane Florence ... uh you know we talked about you know the president\nDoing something on that but all we're really not sure but allowing the the the increase to happen initially up and all was supposed to be about reducing global warming\nUntil they found out from farm to tank it actually produces more global warming gases because of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president doesn't bring up global warming is just oh the government needs to uh get involved in this in order to help the far right um\nAnd then we have the United nations coming out and saying we're doomed\nBecause of global warming that we are uh you have a Al Gore\nTraveling the United nations as well that we have twelve more years yes we'd twelve years now I I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah you'd ever was but this twelve years they mean\nAnd so so how do we solve it well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax on carbon dioxide admissions would be neat to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the\nEnd of the century to effectively limit global warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax\nOn gasoline in that year huh now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah in twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as\nFifty five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine

elections so the Democrats got to bring out the old standby\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increased

for the American people how much they are forking over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it again after a hurricane Michael mhm uh again the blaming of President Trump oh sure and that's why like I said during lumbering if you want to check out his stuff\nUh he writes some great articles and he does believe\nAgain or he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it\nBut he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong but do we have an ... interesting prospect yeah do we have an impact of course we have an impact but we're part of this life cycle here on this planet yes I Do as people

Hi\nGood morning guys our very good at\nAll right well one of the reasons they start incorporating ethanol or allow all into the fuel was that they used to use what was called MTV metal tribunal ethylene an anti not anti knocking right around about it yeah it turned out it was a car Senate envy and put out into the air so they started replacing ... at all alcohol\nYou can't have two hundred proof alcohol it ... it absorbs moisture from the air so the most are going to get it's like maybe one Ninety five Ninety something like that so it's great for the farmers to increase the percentage of our all and the fuel bland\nHowever alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy right around them as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so it's screwing the consumers what that's doing\nWell look we we had no problem with the we we had no problem when we talked about this report with that but all four of the anti knocking capabilities that's not what a temper sent exists\nNo that ... percent mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah we ... we have no ...\nOur problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry down on that kind of\nMonopoly great government dictates All right you need to do this

dumbfounded golden couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general an off the subject was Doug that's the role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this\nAnd tell me what I can release\nAnd what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact\nYou use that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence your CIA director and uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now you know the secretary of defense\nThose are the people you would go to ... to ... to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies\nOr didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the and we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at\nBut yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you are looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general the apartment of justice\nThen you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said they X but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of a Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud or a rounding option and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff\nOr Kelly as well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusions from this information or by de classifying it and we see the on redacted information here\nIf we jumped to the conclusion well first of all the executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial\nPower there you would have to go through a the the department of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on the plate of the inspector general's office ... you would start with Michael Horowitz it's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played\nIt would be well the president saying this\nThat's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena and that's exactly what you do hear think about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even that could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee\nBy the president right while our layers supposed to be a ton of us\nAnd you know ... and for which is someone that's been in place since\nBefore he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly I that's that's a key to opening the door and ending\nThe discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you add the fact of what the inspector general was designed to do in the ... report you might see\nFrom the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report\nOr on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now if you're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrow\nBasically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation or was handled into and then part late into the Russian investigation and all of that now you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information\nSo now ... having already done the investigation on the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation\nNow has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lend support to this new investigation um and it's I think interesting and I think very key\nThat the president turned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands of it for now\nAnd I think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes the perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claimed are familiar with the matter a believer in and he is a former prosecutor what he believes his that he believes there is possible perjury in the fact that\nAh the Pfizer warrant and the supporting documents with the Pfizer warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research and when the when everything was a redacted excuse me on redacted\nWhen everything was opened up and declassified so everybody can see it ... how they got the Pfizer warns application the surrounding documents the three oh twos and the communications between the higher ups of the FBI that somebody in the administration said don't release this Mr President because if you release this\nIt'll be viewed as political you solve with Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released you what they want to really solve it\nNote if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believed they believed because you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... either something extremely wrong or crimes have been committed\nAnd you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unwritten pact that evidence that you have but he can go look from anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case\nHe has access to the documents that the ... the ... the oversight committee could not get from the FBI\nThere is no process that stock Horowitz from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time he has direct access to all of that information\nNow I Want to read a parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI have tried to thwart President Trump on releasing the evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even leave him vulnerable the accusations\nThat he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information on the other major episodes in American history from the bay of pigs to nine eleven\nConsider or any does the the chapter on the house intelligence committee's report earlier this year on Russian interference\nIn the twenties sixteen presidential election until this past week the footnotes really had garnered no public intrigue in part because the U.S intelligence community blacked out the vast majority of its verbiage in the name of national security before the report can be made public\nFrom the heavy redacted arguments all one could tell us at the FBI general counsel James Baker met with an unnamed person who provided some information in September of twenty sixteen about Russia email hacking impossible linked to the Trump campaign\nNot a reporter a policymaker would have added an eyelash over such a revelation than last Wednesday I broke this story John Solomon\nThe Baker admitted to Congress in a non classified setting repeat and an unclassified setting that he had met with the top lawyer at the firm representing the DNC and received allegations from the lawyer about Russia Trump and possible hacking\nIt was the same DNC along with the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign that funded the unverified salacious dot CA by the British intel operative Christopher Steele that became the central piece of evidence used to justify\nThe FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign and the final days of the election he's been following this but what are you saying here's another example again at the FBI and the department of justice\nThese these things aren't top secret about national defense no it's about covering their posture barriers otherwise Baker wouldn't have been saying it in a non classified setting that was the point [noise]\nSo are there you go just a little bit of an update on here and we will keep or we'll keep you updated on it because we believe it's the most important unreported

that only ... and and we learned after a while it there was a lot to that\nAnd uh so the game I see the size is one that the sizes change dramatically the talent level but if you look at it from a from a spectators point of view\nYou're looking at a different game everybody turn that television on everybody comes out\nPretty much in some kind of an offensive formation where they spread the field they got a kid sitting back there seven plus yards he's a quarterback but he's a tale back in many respects\nAnd if he can run in through the ... he creates more problems defensively they spread the field they throw the ball around and it's nothing\nFor people to score forty fifty points a game that's the big change and I think that's what's happening in the game that they've uh they've made it more exciting but they've got talent level that permit them to change the rules by putting excellent people on the field\nEverywhere and uh and move that pull up and down the field very variance\nIn addition to the principles that come forward in the book first forever there are some wonderful anecdotes\nAs a a Bob Garfield was careers inter effect intersected those of book of many
