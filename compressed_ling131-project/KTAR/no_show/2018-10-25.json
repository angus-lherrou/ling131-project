show the thing is joking ruler don't look at it from the snapshot of which is I'm Talking to people yesterday saying why do we care about this guy I'm like it's not just this guy\nRight thinking about the bigger picture when it comes to Saudi Arabia their new leader all of this stuff this is just a nother thing to add to her\nOriginal concept was carried a poorly\nAnd the cover up was one of the worst in the history of cover ups for some bad deal should have never been thought of\nSomebody really messed up and then divorced cover up ever and were should have stopped is at the deal stand what when they thought about it because whoever thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\nAnd they shouldn't be in big trouble\nTrump's like look I Know BS right like I I I Am a showman I Know how to work it exists didn't even pass my smell test this was awful\nNothing that they've done that his government has done well certainly has not been spoken of properly they did the wrong things even thinking about the idea they certainly did a badge of execution and they certainly disadvantage of talking about it or covering it up and he's like to say that\nBut I wouldn't say it was a total fiasco\nAnd I'll say it because you guys all thought of it I think they did a good job in the execution I just think it was the story that was bad and now the crop without so then I got a new as the crown prince spoke today and apparently look a show these kids was there and gave him as you so eloquently put up with is your fill the sting guy\nI spoke with the crown prince yesterday and he strongly said that he had nothing to do with this this was in the lower levels\nYeah that's the new thing it's at a lower level it's ...\nAnd he's come out today it's awful it's horrible it's file it's disgusting it is we're going to find out who did this\nWho did this General McChrystal\nDo you believe in an operation like this could be carried out by rogue elements without the crown prince of Saudi Arabia having knowledge of it or approval of it I think maybe in some states could in Saudi Arabia I don't find that credible if that's not how Saudi Arabia where now I mean the crime\nKnowledge of it or approval of it I think maybe in some states including Saudi Arabia I don't find that credible if that's not how Saudi Arabia where now I mean the crown prince has an amazing at about a power and he has been pulling power him for the last couple of years so the reality is I just not fun they'll find that convincing\nNow now I don't either the guy knows everything that's going on there period case closed and the story he knows everything that is happening there\nEverything everything\nIt's not somebody ... and the fact that they Fifteen people flew in\nDifferent times all of this
