face when I'm going to be an stable enough to commit violent\nHe's right this coming from a guy who was attacked by his neighbor right he was attacked by its neighbor\nAnd also there was that incident at the baseball game you remember that\nThe guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot [laughter] clear who's almost go he was yelling this was for healthcare hit a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill these are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nEver reason for or a means we're trying to resolve things\nNo it's not but that is I think what we're headed to and Rand Paul's right both sides\nNeed to take it down a notch I'm looking at the Republicans I'm looking at the Democrats we've got to have some civility and the fight that they think they're taking on you understand for a lot of them and we've talked about this before here\nWhich is you go on these shows and you you scream and yell at each other in the back a green room there you're talking about hey what are you doing this weekend as your kids you know the whole nine yards the problem is not everybody buys into that\nA lot of them they take it seriously a lot of them look at this WWE Shakespearean kind of theater that's going on

be killed [noise] and ah that those who are ratcheting up the conversation ... getting their face ... bears some responsibility of this over extra power\nYeah let me ask you this let's just say for the sake of argument right that somebody goes out and does something from either side of the aisle that says something that that energizes enough people that they go out and they do something right they kill somebody\nYou think at any point in time that any of these\nPeople are gonna look though you know what maybe maybe maybe we may maybe this is a little too much maybe maybe we need to step the thing that I don't know if it's going to happen that way you know one of the things I said is when I watched that whole thing with Jeff Flake and and several of these other senators and stuff for people coming up and screaming getting into their faces I thought to myself\nDidn't we just have an issue with ... and the shooting and it just seems way too easy for somebody to walk up some of these people in the anger that they had and it's a very interesting situation but civility we need more of it\nAnd I don't think we have it and I think some of the stuff that I talk about ah with people is they are worried about the tribalism in this country they are worried about the way that the country is headed they are worried about how we're talking to one another\nThey're worried that the tools that we have that should be fun and enjoyable have now become tools we can go after each other Twitter Facebook all these things say horrible horrible things to each other with zero accountability and zero worry for anybody coming after you and that\nTo me is not good it's not this mob mentality and mob rule is not good for anybody and it sure now not good for the next generation but I agree with

something and that they do something and they kill a politician and we're like wow\nBut it shouldn't be a surprise it shouldn't based on all the things we're seeing and hearing I doubt it's a surprise

Trade Center in Ninety three they weren't really woke up and aware until nine eleven happened and the same way I don't think that the moderate Republicans were aware that there that that\nExtreme left wing extremism is at war with conservatism until last week\nOr not what I mean there's certainly not not only conservatism just anybody who is opposite them even\nA a a poll politically yeah not necessarily any logically but no it's I don't think it's been planetary what you said because remember in the nine eleven commission\nWhich was put together a bipartisan they said the problem with the United states was they were at war with us and we weren't at war with them right uh and that was added like an ad like so that came from the nine eleven commission so there's nothing inflammatory about that and and I think we're\nYour analogy I I think if you look at that I think also which I think it's correct that the Republicans many of them and the center now are clearly no I mean when you have to think about this when you have a Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins\nBeing the ones who were the ... that really carried if it but not so much with columns but certainly Lindsey Graham touring the conservative torch\nThat's when you see definitely that awareness is is is in full play now and that's where you also see Lindsey Graham saying well I'm going to campaign anywhere and everywhere I can a purple states and and everywhere else\nI think you have to include Susan Collins in in that well I knew she wouldn't dare they ought to do that will be remembered though was gone for it in terms of their mark\nOn this event no doubt her speech for the most part no doubt um she didn't carry she didn't carry the way I guess Lindsey Graham riot but yeah I Would uh she would do that I wouldn't have seen comic I could've seen\nIf you were to ask me maybe weeks out and told me about the situation coming\nI could've still seen as a Collins going well no I'm going to vote no and then a a hike camp voting yes right mhm so I mean that that would have been or somebody if you would have told me that's what's going to\nIf you would have told me that is what is going to happen I was like oh okay I see all the way we never talked about\nI don't know what the even what the numbers in terms of overall numbers of sellers on Amazon\nThe point being is that there are things coming from all over the world that are sold on Amazon and so it would be impossible for although because those has done other things [laughter] that people didn't see coming uh I don't think any time soon he will have he will control completely his own his own ...\nUh but he is doing that more and more and that was to shut out more and more the the the um FedEx and UPS\nDelivery that was costing him more and more costing the consumer more and more and he said this is not about shutting out the little guy if in fact is about creating more opportunity for the little guy and now they they you can go out and get your own local delivery\nUh buy your own local delivery a set up for a for Amazon and by the vans and everything else\nAnd be a part of that and and there's opportunity there it was about creating a a ... basically the ... the ability or more and more to control pricing said keep prices low on Amazon according to ... he's\nThe U. S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise\nPrices on Amazon they do want to do things\nGet rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or\nThey pass it along to the consumer ... plain and simple or\nThis news item the cofounder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier ... for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about uh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians\nTo hack and or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm ... who paid and opposition research from a ... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got or information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of the well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nI don't really know the average Virginia Republican subpoena Simpson on September twenty ninth or after\nThe lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons firmed a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nFusion fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele to conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign\nAnd the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the ... say they're trying to find here's our ... are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a ah\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought\nThat up I I don't think so what are they going to ask him about money I Would I Begin to ask him about Kanye West probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion jeep\nAbout fusion GPS and their\nRole or\nIn the\nUh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and\nAn associate deputy attorney general\nAh\nThe inspector general would have than access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he\nWhat he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes because it because it while they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and and again if\nThose are ... that that's the number of it right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut ah so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were were into communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm you just have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand ... what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't\nLet let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer then what do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at our is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a mall or investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did\nNothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know I'm One I don't know where there was any evidence of it you would uh concerning you know get gathering information and getting the money from ... they're an opposition research firm that just on the level is is ... that's what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you do up as well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell ... Anaheim during the time it gets interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior out testify I'll go under oath I'll do there are plenty of people that go on to row mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis farm yes\nThose are the questions that what they are those are questions on the investigator would have running through their mind ... yes that's all we're not indicting anybody yet [laughter]\n[laughter] ...

tempered today is the hope that a a deal it's going to be done yep yep\nYeah 'cause you see a sell off like you saw in the past couple of days and that's about people losing confidence in those companies that are issuing concerns over those raw materials especially but terrorists overall we'll see what happens with China for on the tracks here's your forecast there's been a\nBig drop to the south of where we've seen snow so far this year we're now talking about Colorado Nebraska portions of even western Oklahoma and north Texas where a snow rain line is set up for the early morning hours and we will see rain pushed to the east\nThen we will see rain pushed to the east we can describe the snow area as being between I Seventy to the north I forty to the south\nI thirty five to the east and a twenty five and the west snow mixed precept and then all rain as you move closer to Texas a small band of snow will be moving out of North Dakota\nYou know in a time she focused in on the Republicans but at the time she did not when she well term crazed\nShores so as soon as she because she's probably\nGoing to say well Republicans are crazy but she's ... that\nThat might be how she defends himself which by the way well she does well that would hurt her beak yes she is trying to position herself as somebody who was by ... so just assume that\nOkay because we can you can hear it already she was just talking about the crazy Republicans\nWell not for somebody who says they're going to be a moderate and work with both parties\nBecause keep in mind I mean this is a the Jeff Flake seat but it's also the state that was represented a by the late John McCain and the left hailed him after after he passed for being someone who essentially rose about politics and work with both sides actually that was\nNot the case in the end and they weren't describing it his behavior in the Senate correctly he moved to the left they didn't move to the right\nTo be clear but ah they on that on on that point\nShe is trying to position herself and appeal to the people that might have supported the John McCain\nRight yeah I looked up\nCuomo can get away with same conservatives are welcome in New York\nRight yes even the ones that are there because we know that and and writing and just being on you get ...\nYou can get away with that New York yeah you can get away with probably saying it in\nCalifornia right\nAnd you can be a Democrat said look I Know all of people are nuts everybody here's crazy or not right and still get elected as long as you promote democratic values might be a little bit different in Arizona\nThat's that's where the differences because you had essentially to a historically speaking and soft Republicans\nI remember he said he epidemic stream conservatives in\nA who oppose abortion and support gun rights have no place in this state yeah that's a huge number of people in New York state\nDeath either by the way um you know this and this is that's that that terminology thing and I I Know I'm splitting hairs and preaching to the choir in terms of our audience not gun rights it's my rights\n\nAh yeah the guy doesn't actually even doesn't that right I was going to have any right by the gun has no rights and gun doesn't have any rights\nI assume all of the the guns rights when I put it in my cold live fingers\nIt's the people's right yes a very\nInteresting I just want to get to this topic because you happen to bring this up and I didn't know about this many employees on the Las Vegas strip fear being replaced by robots and you were telling me there is actually these and I'm looking at it right now that they've come up with these drink robots that will make bartenders obsolete\nYes and you can come as the design I've seen I don't know if this is in place in Vegas just yet\nBut the design of St also includes you walk up to the kiosk or the kiosk is even embedded into the counter like they do the are they actually have like a a if you go up to a bar and a gambling city or for those who don't gamble or never been\nWhen you sit at a bar you can get your drinks actually for free if you're gambling and they'll put the right there\nAt the seat there is a video poker thing you can play mhm right by the way the drinks not free [laughter] it'll cost you whatever you lose and\nVideo [laughter] to be clear you mean they're not giving yeah anything ...\nNow that uh uh just that they don't just buy a bunch of alcohol and lose money on it no I'm\nThe those are the [laughter] getting back to the robot thing\nI'm a I'm not sure what the strippers will look like I ... but but for the bar is they'll move away from ...\nOh man oh no no no no right now bartenders robot brothels\nYeah I I guess by the way we never really talked about yeah we didn't talk about Houston didn't we talk about and we did last week uh well I mean you know if you think about remember the old but I guess they still have them the coffee vending machine where would make you a cup yes yeah I always go back to terminate her to the security guard making the or it\nWas a ... that went to make a a cup of coffee didn't work out too well known as tea to walk up behind them and then became him\nWhich was weird but you think about robotics in serving food that's been around for a while but it will be\nI'll but it will be different in a bar like this where you go up and you basically\nUh order it you know and you know the type it in a you're going to insert your credit card and then all of a sudden the drink is going to be made and even delivered to you depending on the set up on the counter ... by automation\nYou know I think John ... a guy who has a pretty good uh business uh or has over the years in Las Vegas and also from uh the the bar rescue\nYou're never going to see a well first of all there's no way to steal from the till I'm not blaming bartenders from for that I'm not condemning all bartenders but that does happen in the business and you know ... caught it\nWhere they were you know skimming or whatever from from the register but even to a greater extent pouring way too heavy right ... robots not going to do this well either one\nBut I here's the other point because I was thinking the same thing I'd ask John tap for how far can you go with the robot bartender ...\nKind of regular Barbie all robots right and just a person walking around or do you have to is is there a 'cause he talks about the science of a bar mhm and the science of the bar is about people and interaction\nAnd wrote a a a robot can't be pleasant trust me I Know a few of them\nWell a robot also can't be angry either right MBA an angry bartender right or can't can't be a drunk bartender [laughter] well that's that but\nHow how far do you go with the science of it you mean I I can see this working totally in a place like Vegas where the focus is gambling not not communicating with the bartender or not walking into your corner bar\nSo my wife and I uh recently went to a place that had\nA robot roulette wheel now we walked by several times we didn't we didn't look at it\nBecause it was often like they have a a a a what would you say it it's there's there's there's poker and blackjack were you walk up and the screen has\nYou know a dealer but it's it's animated right and so that you know the the whole tables animated the cards or animated\nWell on this roulette that's what I thought I was ... that I thought it was all animated it's actually it's it's an actual wheel in the center and you don't you're not close to every one it's not crowded like a real roulette table\nAnd so we thought okay let's see how this works and it was interesting we played it for a few minutes and it was interesting because I said you know that's that's not the animation thing is still gives you the view of a real roulette wheel right and that's important for a lot of people they don't trust right ... well\nIn in the case of a a a Vegas in in a in a bar setting there's a couple of settings you're going to be a nightclub kind of setting in night clubs are huge in in Vegas um where they don't care they just want to drink\nIt's not your pub writing where is that where the bartender right things to be pleasant needs to be a companion for and carried maybe a little bit of a conversation on with you in Vegas it's not that\nIt's not that for the most part it's either the gamblers or ah like I said the nightclubs and no one cares anything except about the alcohol when it comes to the bar is all about the alcohol or it'd be interesting to see how far this goes\nI Want to be alive when they come out with the home version of the robot bartender\nAh yeah going you're walking your house and they basically you've got bottles that you insert vodka whatever I mean right ten different types of alcohol that you put in their right and the mixer and everything else and then you just walk into your house and\nYou say Alexa give me a screwdriver\nThere you go oh and then she hands you affiliates\n[laughter] now so [laughter] I doubt it oh my God [laughter] and then its eyes I profile alcohol Alexa drinking out [laughter] hey

avoid it will die and we tell folks to avoid that we try to take the other way we went through to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one once you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of debt because when you don't have any payment you know what you have money\nThe bar or a slave to the lender so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar Paul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit you are used as a rule of thumb when buying a used\nCar um\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point it's going to give me trouble so the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it\nIn other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's my called smart anymore so I just give you that example so no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built let's say a higher in nicer vehicle or they're typically well built I mean ... again Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products forge building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck for truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that it's got easily another hundred and it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that we kind of depends on your budget and how nice of car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so it was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to\nWhat is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more than ... miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I'm just I'm just really don't know I Can't because I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how are you\nTaking my call Sherman what's up I'm\nSeventeen years ago and I cook a near I've got about three thousand dollars and like I mean the count out donating shut eye in bed and I knew what China and\nYou're going to college\nHere I mean the college with a pilot program in St Louis and olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... served maturity and I keep program at the community college of either and you're at first\nYou know you know I Will be true if you get some search someone certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that\nCrime so that's what you want to do you won't be a programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever\n[noise] okay uh and the community college is paid for\nAnd for as long as you keep an eye plus yeah um you can invest it all\nRight here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine\nFinish college and all your education was he wrote that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you Dustin as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about studying which is a very usable\nField of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement\nAccount at this stage uh with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal for you is your friend is for you to get your degree in your field of study whether it's a two year or\nThe certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that three thousand dollar spent on that is more important than than the mutual fund so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route [noise]\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nOn Gray Davis it's an honor to speak with you you too sir what's up in your world\nMy wife and I are currently on baby step forward in time for retirement and we're using the access our budget to pay off our mortgage early cool and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay our dilemma is when we say an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from August coloration so when we say the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage to toleration so is it okay to do that or him recommend saving their twenty four\nPercent now they mandatory amount that you're putting in our ... are you vested in that is that a a ... choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGet the answer is no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct that the weight on sixty seven or okay uh and it's nine percent nine percent\nYeah okay so the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct\nCorrect guy I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like\nThe pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its horribly run state\nAnd now we're ... those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so ah but what I count some of it yeah some of it I'm not going to count it as a whole new line what if we counted it as a four or five if we count as a for then that means we need to put it in ten percent\nRight you got a million and not you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood is I'm not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois it's just horribly run and if it was ever going to fail anywhere to be there\nYou know so um that that that's the truth and you know that show a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit our show and just round numbers was put in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only are satellites\nYour mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it was a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nI'm you know go\nThat that's that's what I Would do a backing off a little bit\nAppreciate you joining us this is that I Ramsey show [noise]\nNever more than Fifteen minutes away from today's top news stories Arizona is breaking news and traffic leader with Arizona's

program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four\nAnd it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own as to if you can come together and really get on board it can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know one of the main\nThings that someone needs to do to get out of debt\nAnd budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just fly out the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend too much [laughter]\nWell that's true but generally true okay soil I also think that they need to focus on why they're doing it so to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that\nMy reason why it might not be the exact same reason it hits y but at the end goal that that way in front of\nIs what we're both gravitating toward ...\nOkay cool what was your why\nRight here I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I listen to a lot of your staff and a lot of other um had
