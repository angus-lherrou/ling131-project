human being and people that are real\n\nAnd I appreciate that I think you're absolutely right let's go to Howard in New York City you're on with mark\nHi I just wanted to cover for items would prove about the Democrats the first one is one Obama went up people didn't listen to what you get get his number right away when he made a speech in Egypt in March of two thousand nine\nBasically what he said in that speech was\nThe U.S was to blame for a lot of things instead of saying the U.S made that ... some mistakes and ah we we we meant well but we didn't do it he was knocking to us at knocking it down like he was the enemy of the u._s. people and then he he uh\nHe uh didn't invite my beret the head of Egypt he violated his enemy there so he got to get him overthrown\nAnd then Chuck Schumer in two thousand eleven locally said that we got to do something about the first amendment\nOr here in New York you know because of that but in two thousand her life and it didn't carry much weight because we weren't that liberal at that time uh we have to control it because people are saying bad things about uh candidates\nAnd then the the third thing was\nWas spending guys he when or when he went off and he went to a after the four people got killed the next day he Wendy was scheduled to go to raise money on the coast that he's still went and blame that on that disk you know the thing and the and the one that he really should have gotten impeached for definitely\nWas when the when the insurance companies say at one or two and a half billion dollars more for Obamacare now maybe they needed it and maybe they didn't that someone at that point the Congress wouldn't give it to them\nAnd he took the two and a half billion out of the treasury which he has no authority to do it all and gave it to them and eating they did nothing about it and that's a\nMinor stuff 'cause what he used to do Obama is every hour on the second he would lie to you and people were that stupid because they're not detailed when I Try to explain something to someone because I'm a very detail person\nThey don't want to listen haven't got the patient so maybe they have an IQ of mine is forty\nThank you

six six five oh Jim both what eight six six five oh five or six to six on live five as a jumbo had a Joe dot com you can follow me on Twitter at jumbo talks\nWe will talk in this part of the program about the American role in the world and that is of course has been the subject of controversy from the ball but this country was founded\nAnd it has increased in importance over the years as the size of the power of the United states has grown our responsibilities\nAnd it has increased in importance over the years as the size of the power of the United states has grown our responsibilities have grown and this old world of ours has shrunk because of\nA jet aircraft in satellites and the Internet and the host of other factors we are a part of this planet and a major part of this planet whether we like it or not and so we're talking this evening\nWith Robert Kagan he is the freedom and senior fellow with the project on international order and strategy\nIn the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution a columnist for the Washington Post author of a number of books including his latest the jungle grows back it's published by cannot and sometime America and our imperiled world Mr Kagan thank you for joining us tonight\nThey round me\nThat's a quite a title the jungle grows back and what's the derivation of that\nWell if you think about the fact that you know the world have been living in for all its flaws it's been pretty good uh but you know there are forces out there in the world a forces coming from China and Russia\nOr Iran and terrorists that you know want to sort of destroy the world with ... and that's what I mean by the jungle growing back and we need to continually push back against the jungle or it'll it'll take us over the Gulf us\nAnd and now of course there is a a view that has a at various times been the stronger or weaker but it's never disappeared in that view I guess can be summarized as a none of our business\nNone of our business let's just to stay out of the world to uh keep an arm's length here will just to sit back on our own shores and make our country better and we won't we won't go meddling is somewhat but it\nDisagree strong he was proud of is ...\nThat we should intervene abroad in various places specifically in the middle east\nHaving spent some time in our past life in official and unofficial as the um I just disagree with his premise that the Iraq War was justified way that we should be after I started at all given the fact that we've been there now for over Twenty years we've had changed a darn thing you of the country\nYou're a sauce police are\nWell I mean we have not been effective in Afghanistan you know let's not forget why we went into Afghanistan you know we were attacked so there\nAre I think we would have been done better if we had taken out of out from Afghanistan or they had an opportunity to attack us which is something that we bought a at doing during the Clinton Administration you know as for Iraq I Know I'm not going to go back and say that everything that we did was right in Iraq but I Do think\nI I I still have a hard time believing like better off if we had Saddam Hussein in power\nThat would be yet another vicious dictator or that we can now at people who are now carrying out assassinations or in other people's consulates like the head of Saudi Arabia or we would have Iran still and so you know we make mistakes of the country uh I certainly make mistakes\nOr think about what we should do but the real question it seems to me is a are we going to deal with the threats that are out there are way and ah unfortunately in the middle east there are real threats that we already have seen on September eleventh that come out and attack us and we have to deal with them they're rather than having to fight them here\nAnd to keep in mind also are the areas that were brought up by dock\nOne as regards Iraq Saddam Hussein did not only have programs of weapons of mass destruction but he used chemical weapons against both the Kurds and the Iranians he had a nuclear weapons program and let's not forget that\nAh as for a Afghanistan that was again the headquarters of al ... which was so inextricably mixed with the government of the Taliban that it was hard to tell the two apart when the U.S forces finally reached a\nUh cobble a in some cases or a Taliban government functions were funded\nBy Osama bin Laden and al ... money let's not forget that we had every reason to go in the problem I think we have in many cases is thinking that we could do things like this on the cheap and the quick\nA particularly the second ... Iraq War the notion being that that will go in will pull out the uh\nThe underpinnings of the uh Saddam regime and the entire country will rush to the notion of a free pluralistic western style democracy and as we have learned a lot of parts of this world a culturally have a hard time going down that road [noise]\nThat's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson\nThat road [noise] well that's exactly right and I think you know sometimes you know we we we learn the wrong lesson or whatever mistakes in Iraq\nThen let us to do nothing in Syria where now we have Russian forces we have Iranian forces and we have terrorists horses or you know threatening us our neighbors sending hundreds of millions of refugees are in Europe and I think you know we can't we can't do everything and we should e everywhere\nBut there are places where we're gonna have to address some of these threats or they will in fact affect us directly\nOne eight six six five oh Jim Boeheim when eight six six five oh five four six to six as we go to a Marty who calls in from east Texas and oh Marty\n[noise] yeah Hi Jim uh it it's a I always enjoy your show you know you it's like I'm I'm working on a thesis right now is a historian that the arc of history actually is\nInevitable there was going to be somebody who discovered the new world that was going to be a country that um\nThat are not a country necessarily but there was going to be powers that\nMap to the world and that brought marketing pillows and and and commercialism around the world that we're going to map where they were discovered the world that we're going to be part of the progress that brings us to the point that we are today and I feel that is inevitable and America seems to be the\nUh the chosen vehicles or the inevitable a position that we find ourselves in the world today where we are combating a individualistic notions against a you know I'm collective is notions and that's\nThat's something that I think is important to consider\nAll right let's let our guest to comment on that are your thoughts about uh the the arc of history if you will\nWell I I don't know about the arc of history because I think a lot of things are contingent and and I really do think they depend on human actions but there's no question that the caller's right to say that\nYou know the United states found itself in a particular position or that do other country was in and I some of that have to do with geography you know we talked about\n... surrounded by two oceans which gave us a certain degree of security but it also gave us the ability to send forces at maintain stability in Europe and Asia and prevent or is there\nA that would eventually engulfed us and it gave us the opportunity to to affect\nAn international economy in a way that benefited our road so I think that's you know there is something special about America we shouldn't forget about it whether you know whether there's an arc of history I guess remains to be seen by a certainly United States has been shaped history with its within since well yes\nAnd in and of course it is that this might be if there is an arc of history we certainly aren't yet in a position to be able to ah accurately predicted\nOne eight six six five oh Jim bow and of course we are a little uh uh to be heard not only in our affiliates stations but also a jumbo hadn't show dot com which means or anywhere in the world and the skill joins us from the Philippines where it is a broad daylight pillow gal\nHere's Jim I'm just want to comment on uh on on your guest's views Philippines for like a Korea and like Japan has um treaty ah arrangements are with the United states and under certain conditions we going to be a trip wire\nFor the U.S to enter into a into another major conflict with his his ear or Korea or or or Japan were attacked and a lot of people don't realize that are not that many years ago this war's United States territory\nUntil Nineteen forty six that's true although in the case of\nA of the Philippines I'm not sure how many a potential major conflicts exist and that is to say no true just exactly how many countries out there\nOr are covering the Philippines these days\nWhile they are they we we do have an ongoing problem with the Chinese building artificial island into\nAreas that are ... are claimed as a either territorial waters of other countries such as the Philippines and Vietnam or a areas which should be considered international waters\nOnly taken All right let's let our guest commented about that that notion of a of the some of the a bilateral arrangements we have around the world with the countries such as the Philippines or with the Japan with the with South Korea\nAnd the possibility that that these arrangements might drag us into a large conflict and Robert Kagan\nWell I actually think you know are they actually have the opposite effect if we are reliable uh allies we will deter a China from attacking them whereas if we are pulled back in ...\nUh allies we will deter\nA China from attacking them whereas if we pulled back in ... and those kind of a bit but\nWe will encourage Chinese attacks and then I get drawn in to conflict anyway I mean the fact that we are reliable allies out their means that we can maintain stability and maintain eat and not have to get into\nWar is if we think that we could stay out of the conflict that involve China and Japan and Korea and all those other countries out there I think we're kidding ourselves we've already discovered\nA twice over the last century that we can stay out of those conflicts\nAnd if we try to do so uh uh if we tried other words to go for quote the peace and honor in our time will usually wind up with either one\nThat's right and you know people talk about or offshore balance but that's what we were in the Nineteen thirties so the consequence of that was we went up a fight on shore so I think it's better to ... ... the security arrangements\nStay with us or more to come but one eight six six five oh Jim ... is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Robert Kagan our guest is the Freedman senior fellow\nWith the project on international order and strategy at the foreign policy program of the Brookings Institution online at Brookings dot edu is a columnist for the Washington Post author of the return of history at the end of dreams\nOf dangerous nation of paradise in power and they twilight struggle you served in the state department and the

to six more from our guests Robert Kagan and your calls on the boat had a job in a moment\nArizona's news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F. M. K. T. A. R. dot com and streaming live on that Katie a our news that\nI don't want to be pressured into buying something I don't want to have any really good at\nIt so much easier when there is someone I trust to help me out just one person who actually knows what's going on it's all I Need\nOpposed and didn't have and you had an meat dividing line and in fact Thomas Jefferson said\nYou know in a way it's precisely because there is such a neat dividing line that makes it impossible to avoid conflict eventually you know the divisions we have today they're like\nNeighbors disagreeing with neighbors you have people in the suburbs disagreeing with people in the city it's really hard to see any kind of geographical line uh and we don't have the kind of fundamental institutional difference that we had between a slave holding south and a capitalist north so\nI think we're we're obviously in great disagreement and we see polarization uh but I don't see a civil war I think that was a very special circumstance\nWell I certainly am happy to hear you say that and I certainly hope and and I actually think that you are correct Carolyn ... Pennsylvania now but even Carol ... you say that it and you need to keep that radio turned down Carol this could be a very long call [laughter]\nCarol [noise]\nI don't want to say much all I Want to say as I Am against the United states going first strikes well\nOkay I'm not sure that uh that we have any comment plated or as a matter of a of a your thought process Robert Kagan\nA I guess we would have to define a further first strike I doubt that were of a mind to go around and let's say when they first a strike a nuclear option a full scale World War three type of should of\nOption although my guess would be that there may be places and circumstances in which ... proactively engaging a problem before it gets worse and something less than the nuclear level might be on occasion the

right there is a ... you know the human species are definitely in pervert veteran were highly competitive but I see a comparison in the original ashtray or the tragedy of the comments\nAnd at times when you have people that are vying for specific resources\nA vote they will come to conflict rather than a compassion\nAnd unfortunately a classic example of people that are still deep rooted in hatred among each other is the conflict in the middle east because it's so biblical so I mean people just don't get along at certain points in times when they think something of\nOf reserve a value of

away and jeopardize\nLet me offer a thought here about two areas that were bound to be conflicts forever one would be the war in Northern Ireland which of course did not last forever\nAnd other goes back to some years ago when I was working with a young woman who said that she wanted to go cover the next war and she was moving to South Africa\nAnd at the time I said well first of all I was just back from Vietnam myself I said I'm not so sure you want to cover the next war but knowing you maybe you really do I said if that's what you want\nThen that's probably as good a place to go is any of the only place I could have put on a par with that I suppose was was somewhere in India or Pakistan well of course India and Pakistan have not had an all out conflict in quite a while and there never was a full fledged war in South Africa\nIn which the south Africans ever had to use those nuclear weapons that they in fact a later admitted the existence of and dismantled so uh if you want to look at those conflicts alone or South Africa which is still troubled today to be sure but there's been no all out war there\nA Northern Ireland which still has its problems but again the vicious gorilla fighting has gone away and I'm not sure what Robert Kagan I Would buy the thesis that some conflicts can never be resolved\n[noise] yeah well I mean I think the conflicts can be contained and that's what you know we've done for instance in Europe you know when I when you talk about the middle east and help people of Haiti and show there forever in fighting each other forever\nOr you know in the Nineteen thirties that's exactly what people said about Europe and it was true you know Europe and Europeans have been fighting each other for centuries and people said well how can how can we expect to bring\nEurope to peace and yet and yet we were able to now I'm not saying that that is you know whatever we did in Europe we can necessarily do in the middle east it it may be more than an effort that we want to make but I agree with you Jim that you know you can't look at any of these conflicts in Northern Ireland is a perfect example\nA and say that there's no way of of putting a lid on it maybe people might still hate each other or not like each other but it doesn't mean that they have to be at war with each other and I think sometimes outside forces can really play a helpful role in that regard\nYeah and then they get I get it boils down to the fact that perfection is not the litmus test here ... things are made better I think that's a much more a plausible a litmus test for any
