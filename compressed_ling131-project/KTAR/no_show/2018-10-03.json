to chose your Twitter you can\nTweet at us so I [noise] I I\nFind this to be interesting I said something last week about the fact that when you look at ... at all the things that struck me most is it is for all intents and purposes\nIt's the John Hughes movie of the Nineteen eighties remember those pretty and paying some kind of wonderful all of those movies that were as it was the rich kid there was the poor kids was Molly Ringwald it was all of this stuff and lo and behold people talking about\nSixteen candles might be one of John here the seminal cinematic classic that that doesn't mean every aspect of the movie had age well in fact there are a lot of scenes in the movie that are more likely to make you cringe than laugh\nSure it was a product of the era that some of the movie moment of cultural insensitivity are just plain hard to overlook upon a modern review [noise]\nCome on\nYou're ... years ago so cool violet hurts in order to [noise]\nOkay so that's the retro rage modern sensitivity who's an average but that's what a way it was in modern sensitivity\nModern sensitivity [noise]\nWe look at things now we we look at today's world\nAnd we think that everybody should have been as woke as we are today ten years ago Fifteen twenty thirty forty fifty years ago doesn't work that way that's what ... ... ... is that is like looking back when the first time we've crawled out of the ocean right and crawl around the land that you should be involved in woke us that's ridiculous\nWe evolve not only physically we've all we've evolved mentally socially\nRight\nNot only does he gave her the cold shoulder just because of another girl has shown interest in hand buddy even encourage the desperate freshmen had to take her home because he's trying to death out on her with Sam and predict shell needs to be drawn to tell them apart anyway\nJake early freshman so she was she will know the difference\nOh my God he's a horrible guy horrible horrible guy can you believe that but this was\nUnderstand to what they tried to point out there was this it was this weird world of of nerds and ... freshmen and yet there was former head and that was Anthony the whole there and and and you know it was the rich kids and the poor kids and how they came to as all of this stuff\n\nIt wasn't just socially it's horrible remember the donor right\nAnd all the things I mean all this stuff that goes into these things\nAnd that's the thing I mean I look back and I think about all the movies now that can't be made that we look at and go oh producer Phil here's one Blazing Saddles could you do that today oh hell no hell no no chance\nAnd I'm waiting for them to go you know we can't sleep we can't do this work is every once in a while you'll see like in the summertime the like hey we need on Tuesday nights we both Classics We can't play these things anymore because of the cultural sensitivity today we're already changing things in colleges\nThey're changing Mark Twain's books and others were books we were getting rid of Laura Ingalls Wilder books because it was culturally is not sensitive to the day's world and that is insane\nYou know I\nMovies with John Hughes um his intention was to not make Porky's or Animal House um but I think you know as everyone says and I do believe is true\nAs I Do believe is true that the times were different and what was acceptable then is definitely not acceptable now and nor should it have been then but that that sort of the way that it was\nAgain yet Porky's I I don't know how many times I've seen Porky's support is much Animal House one of my favorite movies of all time\nAbsolutely these movies were a little bit they they were definitely different it wasn't just teenage aunts there was all kinds of things that they were going through were the other ones were just anxious and it was craziness and it was wild was about the drinking and all this go revenge of the nerds is another one\nYou look at that and that was another movie that I ... a lot of us watched and we'd like\nDon't look at the end retro rage back to back then you look at it he said that's what it was back\nThen obviously we've we're more will today we're more socially ah we've evolved in so many ways in ... that's white comedy it should be comedy is at the height of where comedy is in a way that hasn't been for years and at the same time more and more people will try to stifle it\nMore and more people try to shut it down because they don't like what people said well there's Dave Chappelle or Joe Rogan or or Daniel Taj are a lot of these people that you know you go out there like ... they just they don't care\nBut they get destroyed for it right we can't do what we can do these things like we used to be able to do these new to me go and look at something like even\nA guy was that movie a few years ago with the ah got what they got crazy in\nVegas I'm trying to think what it was when I got lost their I forget my my mind's blind [laughter] drawing a blank but can you do that's ten years on right Fifteen Years on its retro rage\nI feel very differently about the movies now and um and and it's a it's a difficult position for me to be in because there is a lot that I like about them um and of course I don't want to appear ungrateful to\nJohn Hughes but I Do oppose a lot of what is in those movies\nThat smaller ring well well guess what you're famous because of those movies you're famous because of those movies\n\nAnd I'm sure if we look back I watch shows all the time and I looked at the way that that that that you know whether it's Archie Bunker or The Honeymooners or or gun smoke and the way that people talk to each other is a totally different world\nI get that but that's the way it was then\nLeave your modern sensibilities and home and just admire it for what it was at the time\nI Believe that there is still a lot of good and the sounds a and there's a lot that I'm proud of and I I feel like in a lot of ways they've\nThey've touched teenagers and and sparked a conversation that is important and having a a teenage daughter and myself I Know that it's not always easy to get teenagers to talk\nNo it's not because they're too busy playing on their damned phone's right that's what the movie would be today that wouldn't be any of that because you mean girls today comparatively do can you a lot of the things that we look back on oh wow Heather's or a lot of these other things that they it's just it's a different world it really is\nBut I can look back on it for what it was at the time the problem is people get separate that any more\nThey want it to be they want to move their modern sensibility if you will their inclusiveness they're all this stuff and they want to they want to move it back to there and say look how horrible you were on some kind of wonderful is one of my favorite movies of all time I love that movie\nI feel like the movies that I made then we're very much representing the culture at the time [noise]\nYou know and and I feel like that is why they resonated with people because it it was their experience and they didn't feel like they had these films that were that were real they weren't they didn't have that sort of after school special\nFeeling where somebody was you know teaching them a lesson and you know it didn't it didn't feel like that\nNo no it wasn't it was interesting it was fun and it wasn't an afterschool special it was something more than that and I don't want people attacking my childhood and sick and tired of it\nIt was what it was that was the time in the Arab trust in fifty a hundred years are great great grandkids are going to look back at our kids and go wow they were not woke as we're woke\nFunny let it go three two three

protests of the national\nPresidential election or excuse me presidential alert system that election system [laughter] that was ... ... the presidential alert is similar to the state level systems that led police on local authorities send out amber alerts and weather warnings the biggest differences scale\nThe nationwide system is designed to blast a message to all two hundred and twenty five million smartphones in the United states reaching about Seventy five percent of the population news of the presidential alert test drew almost immediate criticism\nOn social media was some people vowing to turn off their phones believing wrongly that they will be a captive audience of president Donald Trump\n[laughter]\nWe're worried that the system would allow him to tweet every American mhm or text every American it's a tweet here in the story yeah\nOr the federal emergency management agency ... and experts say the presidential alert will not be Trump's personal megaphone\n[laughter] yeah but I don't [laughter] I bet they are a lot of it they argue\nThey are arguing oh they're ... yeah\nA necessary twenty first century update to the emergency alert system that has for decades allow the president authorized broadcast on every television and radio in the country and in the event of a national emergency so uh to Eighteen or this afternoon ... will send up the first message testing\nThe new nationwide presidential level wireless emergency alert it will go to every smartphone\nIn America that has turned on and within range of a cell tower there is no opt out originally scheduled for September twentieth\nThe test was rescheduled to today due to Hurricane Florence ...\nThe message to smartphones will be followed by an emergency alert system message broadcast on every TV and radio\nAt ... pm eastern time\nIt will feature a voice that says this was a test to the emergency the national emergency alert system the system was developed\nBy broadcast and cable operators and voluntary cooperation with the federal emergency management agency and the Federal Communications commission and local authorities to keep you informed in the event of an emergency ... if this is about an actual emergency an official message would have been followed a the tone alert you heard of started a message\nAs as we said with the you know the on the uh the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada mhm ah by the president coming in and and and stating\nA that there has to be more American or should be more North American materials are in these in all the vehicles and all the three countries and setting labor standards and some wages in Mexico\nWhat you're doing is you're going to be driving out the lower uh the the the the lower worker and expect to see a ton more automation coming to Mexico and the United states lowers your workers will be again right a lot lower overlooked lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked\nAnd they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because\nFewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada and that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the president's ... main goal we talked about this yesterday\nWas to have companies in the United states producing it here and selling it elsewhere\nWell by doing what he did you're going to get the opposite right there's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell\nMake cars here and sell them elsewhere and because of all the rules and regulations we'll put on cars and all of North America and Canada and I have to say North America and then say Canada Mexico and not in the United states because they have\nChanged North America to that in the actual name of it and and so you know we discussed it a yesterday I not the wall Street Journal and others you don't have that discussion saying look you're actually going to hurt\nCar production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico or there's something in a safe fine you're gone automation you know automation a comes in ... comes into this particular point\nAnd in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to\nDefeat all the cost of the regulation from government\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating part in\nIt and keep in mind and two thousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash their their foreign arms their foreign business was what was\nKeeping them alive you you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here ...\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect mhm based on economics which is how people respond to incentive and disincentive ... not my opinion it's how people respond yeah eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting

saying okay I'm not sure maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done\nRight\nSo that sixty five percent of American of voters favor or that an investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it's late ah [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency\nThe first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and oh I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n\nOr ... you know it's interesting that seems like a after a two years Americans are paying attention fell into the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice\nOr to see how the investigation started ... a is a is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said that believe that Trump committed collusion and they want to find out later on and they're willing to release it to ... to ... that he committed maybe there's a couple of people in there that actually\nBelieve that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nA you know beyond that a typical party line number of just ... you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so\nThat goes to sixty five which means there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that and who knows why they want it but yeah maybe they think that it's going to show that he's guilty but we but we've been saying this it doesn't matter\nWho's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparent\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to or we talked about it earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant application and and and those Twenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey just disappeared president says going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story\nRight well we did a a early last week when we said because we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guy just started talking about it casually on the air and saying\nI mean what in the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies or we're going to release it ah but ah we're\nA it but we have some objection from our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the saying an expedited way and we went inspector general inspector general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because it's former CIA director and talking about OK what our ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and an information I'm Christopher Steele that they didn't want released but we still started thinking to ourselves\nWait a minute why would it go to the inspector general inspector general ... we don't understand that doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh\nYeah so in the un redacted version\nThey have found information that they wish to give to the inspector general of the United states whose ... the inspector general of the department of justice and whose job is to find corruption and the abuses in the department of justice\nBecause you look at the aerial imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that and certainly a you have Kelly in the room with him and then that advising as chief of staff where do you go with this I could see General Kelly looking at us and and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nIf this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the Obama administration\nI'm a administration if that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here than this actually will require Horwitz inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes but\nYou take the politics out of it because you let the G do all the investigation on it tell us what happened here because the I\n... going to have access to records keep in mind what it was like for Republicans on oversight committees and really the White House the White House has been calling you know ... echoing a the the uh the the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that yeah gee has access to it directly yeah\nSo the I. G. takes this and the president because of the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this\nUh on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president while the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to declassify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents but the I. G. has access to everything in the department of justice\nAnd any kind of trail on devices and everything else that the president would ... ... ... it would it would take a million years for the president's call for that and for that to to be handed over\nAnd you take away from Adam Schiff the accusation that you're selectively yet just declassified part of life because when you give it to the inspector general\nHe's going to cover that part of it okay what is the context of everything that you have released let's expand the investigation and all of a sudden everybody went quiet and the interesting thing is we talked about\nUh uh that you know Deborah Nunez initially was asked about what's going on here I mean they they could have done this thing and why give it to the inspector general and then he's gone quiet and everybody has gone quiet on this you hear nothing right and\nThe media is not covering it really the mainstream media I haven't seen one story in the mainstream media about why did they give it to the inspector general\n\nWhy is the inspector general looking at all this they don't have only looks at corruption\nRight that's what he's still he's looking for corruption in the department of justice they redacted this and all of a sudden they don't release it and it goes to the inspector general well did they find out that it's that the the redacted part is things that the inspector general is actually been looking at right now right\nAnd so it goes to it goes to either help assist in the investigation or the fact is he's got all this material has looked at it already\nAnd it's part of the when you talk about Russia probe Trump didn't say what Russia probe right which one which one because I read it and said oh Russian pro which Russia probe\nWe initially thought you know because because I I'm On the one time they said well mothers in but\nThere's this limit for Mueller's investigation right but on the tweet he said Russian probe right and I went oh that must have been Mueller investigation that [laughter] right might not be you know it may not be the investigation that they're talking about you did what any mother said Russian probe I'm like whoa now look at the\nPattern of behavior in the in the entire history of this this whole thing starting in the beginning of twenty Seventeen right yeah what was that pattern of behavior leaks to the media how many of those leaks favored Trump\nOr almost or maybe exactly zero zero\nSo you have this situation there are people on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department that are not obviously not Trump on Trump's side\nIf if this on redacted classified material had damaging\nInformation about Trump wouldn't we at least start hearing those types of rumors the sources say it's very damaging on Trump and if that were the case would he also turn it over to the inspector general if it were\n\nIt wouldn't serve him politically I don't know it's not required to turn that over ... right but I don't think this I don't think any of this has any information that Trump was involved in this was all the up yeah in the department of just I Know but what I'm saying\nIs it would be damaging to Trump that they were finding something on him ... OK okay then about what it was actually want to go show was legit right that is going to go OK okay right that it is that the whole thing was legitimate and it was based on something\nEric hardly here

hello overly him into welcome to have you with us\nThing uh you know on this subject a rat I you know they weren't that stuck out for me when people\nTranquility and you mentioned as we had our nation America\nOr that would be one nation by did as ... ... ... and we'll find with low ... issues whether it's a cabinet off or immigration or Republican or Democrat\nI was hearing what ...\nIs an independent hey it's like well they will make\nA law of their own name we should look at her own in Ninety\nEight and say OK\nCurrently I'm living in Florida that'd be Republicans have a certain philosophy\nPhilosophy of the way they would like to see things yeah maybe we should make Florida and fully a Republican state\nDemocrats have a certain way with which they like to see things done or whether they care about the environment or support abortion or what have you maybe we should make 'em heck this democratic state\nAnd maybe if we had each individual may have the Democratic philosophy for Republican philosophy people that have those philosophy belonging to Democrats or Republicans couldn't live in that state and there wouldn't be all this animosity and great\nWell that assumes the course of the people who are extremely mobile and also assumes that we can simply dictate what state is now granted election returns may also indicate a which direction estate goes but uh the notion of of officially establishing something\nOr how would you feel in Florida was determined to be the opposite of you what are you going to just pack up and leave\nSure I Would say that there wouldn't be more peace and tranquility in a day that whoever supported\nThey they ... they whether it be bought abortion or offer abortion people living in that they wouldn't be much happier and it wouldn't be in line and much more productive state\nOf the most people have much closer ties to a locality than that I mean he grabs your quite willing to move wherever whenever but other people have\nFamilies they have jobs they have the traditions and and the like and and they would not certainly it would not be all peaceful if suddenly all the Republicans are in a\nA Florida in let's say were moved to Georgia or something where you where are you going to do to the point of a gun I mean I mean it it just it honestly Ilene strikes me is just a tad unrealistic really\nAs long as you have a free society now of course if you are if you didn't have a free society ... it'd be very simple but\nPeople are much lower than they\nAre going on not some are some many or not\nI mean don't you think that's a matter of choice and one's individual white it's kind of like if they don't like it up north because it's old they'll St Louis downtown\nOh they can but you're talking about the forcibly moving them\nOh no I think for moving them it would be held in ... well that they're going to be happy where they live well\nBut they're they're going to be more unhappy if they they feel like they've got to leave their their view I think would be fine somebody wants to leave the others leave\nAgain that would be an optional thing either they can choose to leave a well let's say that would support their values are just being aren't used to be happy because I didn't\nBut of course you know election returns will change what a given state happens to do and then that's kind of an American viewpoint or so of again a I'm not sure that I see that as as a solution may do draw lessons from it to your arm\nSo I I I think he'll win raises an important historical point the United states was\nA as you know originally Thirteen independent independent countries briefly and the ... the deal that brought the United states together under the constitution\nWas a was a deal that was supposed to allow\nExactly the kind of
