color so far we really appreciate it thanks to all of a couple of other stories you want to make sure we cover them back to your calls and\nComments on the political divide in America\nI just I traveled over this one on um MSNBC and on Saturday chore read and the panel were in a discussion on voter suppression you know they've got the very tight race Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp for governor of ah of Georgia and then\nThey're trying to make a big deal he's from voter suppression voter suppression are talking about the fact that ah there's you know there's a law in Georgia\nThat you have to purge the rules and they got it wrong it said after every two elections it's not up for seven years and by the way a lot of people left have got that wrong except for seven years you have to purchase it and they're like\nAnd voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression voter suppression\nThe law was passed by Democrats in Nineteen Ninety seven that you had to purge the rose after seven years if you didn't vote ... if you didn't vote so so Democrats passed the law it's like\nYeah but he wants to do it [laughter]\nWe passed that we didn't really mean it means they make [laughter] we're Democrats we passed the law to purge the voter rolls if you don't vote every seven yeah\nBut he's actually doing it and he's a Republican so that's bad he's surprising the vote I mean this is help by the way if you want the most bizarre issue out there it's the claim of voter suppression by the Democrats\n[noise]\nThat is when you think about it how bizarre that it\nYeah um it's it's just like the money in politics we hate it if the other side's raising more money\nWe love it if that though is raising a ton of money\nSo and then a Casio Cortez she did it was very little money so they're not ... they're one more example of them just\nBasically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and well well we need to change that\nWell that works against us\nOf them just basically reaching out every time they get defeated they'll reach out and we'll well we need to change that well that works against this\n\nBy the way voter fraud doesn't happen the story's a couple of weeks old but I I Want to bring it because we we got involved there were so many different topics going on we were on vacation never got to this a couple of weeks ago for women were indicted in North in a north Texas voter fraud rang\nProbably a couple of hundred thousand people maybe even more that are voting for Greg Abbott but will not vote for Ted Cruz ... there are people out there that are voting for Greg Abbott who will vote for federal ... why would be my question mhm\nRight because there's such a disparity if if there is and\nAnd right now ah ah with real clear politics or he's roughly up a a Ted Cruz roughly seven points\nThey they moved it I think in our cp though as to now lean it's not a close to ... Republican ... uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only get six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz\nAnd have it once by twenty huge number of people we voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question well\nYou know we have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in and the you know part of the answer that uh that you would get if you were to learn that but we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the demon oh uh yeah I agree with you know and and you know I mean back when banner was\nWas speaker of the house and and you know a ... there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the our and see if the convention in the summer of twenty\nSixteen yeah but without the age but now he's beautiful ... yes right well because now he's useful but if you decided to challenge the president away to managing and twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I was better find was that it seems to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but\nIt it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but in that setting it was about his lack of endorsement and now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me even though the president is with him in Houston\nI'm not I mean I I think you would probably again with some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott and are not going to support\nTed Cruz for one reason or the other and it's it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen\nI Would love to see those votes how many votes forever but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate mhm\nYeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered that in fact have been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and that and and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what word comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott\n... wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip

this guy\nOr whoever it is the most recent was there at the current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with that is by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the ... out of the mindset of group think that if I'm if I'm involved in group think if I'm being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin and then my mind is still in the plantation\nAnd that that's what I Try some of the other for your your your according to figure out a a Republican plantation what I'm saying what what ... are you a ... on right now that one out loud here it's a fake as you really think because\nWhen that when you talk to the right folks about the homosexual affair and the marriage thing or whatever\nIf you talk to the mission by issue as they lined up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best hope right brainwashed into fishing or racism racism racism racism you know it clouds their their their their judgment\nYou know I I Wonder because you know we've talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats and and the identity politics that have really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's must\nAh recognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and when I started thinking about that and wonder\nHow many 'cause we said this we said what the trans gender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there standing wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay\nMaybe this is time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nBecause it's a challenge is so what does this fight band for a way yeah was it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender ... there's also a trans racial Islam and they want you to believe well if you'd that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights at the protected groups created under the civil rights act if there if you can belong if anyone\nProtected groups created under the civil rights act\nIf there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group then there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups\nThen the civil rights era is done it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era that happened there all that entire battle this we're not\nAnd not only that ... into the uh the civil war was for nothing and when you fight\nAgainst other oppressive a governmental systems\nYou know why did we fight you know just to say oh it's not that we should have done that uh we're we're on a different path now so I'm like no we are America this is America when I say that we're as individual is better than anybody or any of the country\nWhere say our ideas are better than everybody else in or out of the country\nYes and ... and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas\nIn in in the constitution where they they don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives in at the right that you ... you won't acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous racism in slavery and Jim Crow was\nAnd I don't know any conservative that which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can't have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative\nBut he left the Democrats that well I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with somebody and he died before I got to ask him but I said would ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but\nWhen you think of what they what the Republican but the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about and then the identity politics where everything\nIs about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe the woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be a must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence\nAnd what I find in credit is what I find incredible as the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming\nFrom the Democrats\n'cause when I talk to black men about or that situation um they fully understand\nThat the uh 'cause I don't you remember it was all white lady that was several years ago she ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every\nBlack and we know that within the city and okay but under scrutiny and that came out that she just wanted to run away or you know so\nSo I'm like no you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system would be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against cultural for which\nJames uh thank you so much yet saying some reshaped writes thought for ... than\nThe\nYeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me I'm a conservative and live my life well\nYou know it's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often\nAnd and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor who's been my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years at the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the street corner not not our street but the the the cross street there is a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign\nAnd another conservative that's running on the state level for for ah for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level and I just I just wonder I haven't asked him yet 'cause I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative and I haven't had a chance to ask him\nHas anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs you know from your yard because he has them right there on

one who's not got the credit that she deserved and uh we have a call for our guest Jason ... from Lawrence in the champagne Illinois Lawrence a good evening and do welcome to the program\nThank you and good evening in both I wanted to share a some information about what was it may have made that original comment\nA ten or more years ago I was watching a historical presentation on PBS or CSPAN\nAnd uh what was portrayed was it was no less than Benjamin Franklin\nWho approached John Adams is to make a comment that an apology was in\nAnd of aid for John ... get onto apologizing or how they're he had spoken negatively about certain other members of the convention his wife\nA menu of and said that a famous line apparently that gentlemen don't read another man's letters to his wife\nWell who knows that may have been the the the origin nation to that it is a credited ... living in in general but of course the the important thing is is the notion that somehow that uh it's an sporting a I guess in in times of winning or potential war when in fact\nUh it it it may not be quote sporting but this uh this is a is a serious business\nWell I just want I mean\nYeah ... but again in terms of the origin or perhaps so I I had not heard that particular story Lawrence but thank you for sharing a I Want to take a look at how you came across this story a Jason\n... shirt so are you talking about surveillance and wiretapping and sort of American attitudes about all of that I'm In twenty twenty Thirteen I was reading about the Snowden leaks ah you know the Snowden story he revealed that the national Security Agency was gathering\nOr a you know communications records of millions of sort of ordinary Americans and this is a very surprising a lot of people surprising me and I started to read about the essay and history of being a sec when you read about the history of the NSA\nAll roads lead to this guy a William Freedman Elizabeth Friedman husbands die he's considered to be the godfather you say if you go to NSA headquarters at Fort Meade there's a large lord\nMan by the way as in Maryland directly between Baltimore and Washington but go ahead\nSo if you if you go to and it's their headquarters there um you know there's a bronze bus William Freedman head outside of the auditorium there's named in his honor\nSo he's he's considered to be the man in reading about William a who was a code breaker famous code breaker I started his wife Elizabeth was also cook brick yeah that's interesting right how ... how many husband and wife or could raking teams can possibly be a and so I started looking for more information on that um and there wasn't really\nThat's been his wife a cook raking teams can possibly be a and so I started looking for more information on that\nUm and there wasn't really that much out there but I did find a link to a library Virginia private library that that happened to have twenty two boxes of letters and other materials that she had lost their before she died in Nineteen eighty so one day I just decided to drive down I Lived in Philadelphia\nSo drove down to the library and I I went inside and I said hello and ... I was curious about Elizabeth Smith treatment collection and and they were very friendly and they they brought out box one\nOf the twenty to a boxes that Elizabeth left I started reading her letters and ah it was just one of these moments in in your career that you'll never forget because as soon as I started reading her her handwritten letter Sheila hundred years ago I was just\nA immediately taken with her I mean she's such a such a vivid kind of voice on the page and and the materials that library had where\nA or were the kinds of materials that any journalist and author would would walk to stumble across it was her original college diary was there it was you know love letters that she wrote to William early in their relationship some of the letters were actually written in\nCode what one of the ... not read the letter of guards who else would do that right\n[laughter] right yeah no I mean it's it's actually it's actually kind of a are you this lovely 'cause we we tend to think of\nSecret right writing a secret message as as a way to\nUm as a way to hide things but for them it was a way to flirt let's bring them closer together and uh it was just that the the texture these materials was was just a very cool to me and I and I realized after spending some time with them that uh there was an untold\nStory here they're really good needs to be cold it was a story of you know this amazing hidden woman who was behind the developments of American intelligence and the twentieth century it's just kind of a genius\nTo solve all kinds of problems and fix all kinds of messages and you know the more I read the more I realized that she she's kind of like a figure and American intelligence sister she's\nBeen able to I Want to come back and continue that thought or as we will continue right after these messages\nArizona's news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F.
