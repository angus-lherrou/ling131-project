California a mark Marty welcome higher and run I run You're welcome to the show\nYou guys great show as usual thanks like I had a\n... and I don't know if that's relevant but I think that if mark judge were to possibly\nA super slander against stunk report or other not whatever his name is uh\nUh I think that some I think I think that may slow them down a little bit in their efforts because I agree with you guys are going to continue to this guy um but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen yet he ... not the same rules of capping off now or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was then I\nBrought it and I think it would slow them down that we give them food food for thought\nYeah I I mean you look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically not pursue this any further um\nMaybe there's something there may be there's the they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is\nFact is that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but um he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ...\nHere's what's interesting you the names were brought out as a result of the leak forward as far as we know she didn't leak it\nSo if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it\nBecause what responsibility do they have in a case brought by ... by march judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked it to the media would also be partially responsible\nAre forgetting his name out there\nAnd that you could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case yeah that was that was him yes you have in any case eliminate because I think they're getting the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right I the only possibility of backlash when I'm ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy ...\nThey already the right is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that there was a destroyed this in spite of using his buddy to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out uh in every ... ... a predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come they use our imagination to come up with things\nAnd and thank you I'm ready for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as the capital capital did and and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of 'em are judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that is that survived at all was Dr Ford's claim and and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so that's\nWhy I Am and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so she wasn't trying to link\nIt to the ... a a media but in the ... in any case yeah to me that would even be a ... and again\nI don't know who leaked and so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm using right that that is a possible exception here right ah but with the other any case to me that's clear I mean\nGoing going after cabinet all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law views them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know things like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out in print that right eye and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat says then you've got to make your case and say worst probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I'd like to just to having any personally\nWell I mean well because [laughter]\nWhere the ... the claims that were carried out\nWere carried out and how he pursued this\nWhat role did he play in pursuing this in the media pursuing this and charging you a ... and in filing sue the New Yorker sworn statement the New Yorker ah for publicizing it and and and publishing it that\n[laughter] Hi how are you ... got his um\nThe Republicans they keep complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody like for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or a guy and find sent and so on it's like telling a a a bank robber I'm complaining about it we were both well we're not going to hell\nWhoa whoa where's the perjury potty approved the perjury\nHow do you prove the perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one guy and finds fang\nOkay well I Know I might have ... well my point is we go point by point by what you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge for who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with her ... she has a spy a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe that yes of course right\nI I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that and I believe they have that in their promise their their ... I Believe they are promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge very kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell ... that's ... that's followed that wasn't Republicans fault no\nThat was the guy that was combing who clearly was politically driven and and that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWhat do you expect the the Democrats just stop doing any of these you know with I don't which are\nWhat are they would get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe've set about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with ah with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's which wasn't enough itself a crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email a investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted\nWe said well it what matters here's the court of public opinion what you did and ultimately she lost in November twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call it is not\nAlways that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House you know here's here's\nUh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding ... sparks Nevada was responding to when we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following\nA defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened\nA he said she said all of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level\nOf perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it right uh you know or it was you know I you know I I don't I'm\nI'm trying to think of wins you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm\nUh and and so my point was I I don't know the doctor Ford situation\nIs there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah ah any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can cooperate and so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nAnd and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats and that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed mhm uh and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that your punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explain Clinton was in the ...\nExplain Clinton wasn't the Republicans ...\n... if you're angry that justice isn't always done all I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged is because there's a majority there's there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\n\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nA ... for example Susan Rice sure if I'll be lap when you said she said you know that that she would like to ... she would consider running against colon seems like an excuse me you're on the line item on ... no it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line about a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone\nIn the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody wouldn't agreement that is what she did and they would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn anything is that the truth is told ... I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies that don't want us to relieve some of this information and\nUh those so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make ... Michael ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from like ...\n[laughter] do you have to my colleagues miss them and I don't have that [laughter]\nWhatever you do give it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went data mhm 'cause it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story has been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to\nThe inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd\nSo we don't know what's going to happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing\nThat's on that yeah and that's\nThat that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency on on all of it the whole Russians scandal thing\nWe said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as it as fully transparent and the process the American people can decide because we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really want an investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is that what they really really want\nFrom three witnesses with no cooperation at all who stories were slowly and sometimes rapidly falling apart because this is this would play out in the public\nOver and over and over for a very very\nLong time eight six six Ninety red eye [laughter]\nSix six months he wrote our phone [noise]\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accidents three miles than registered and joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThe tough tested Bowers lead is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows truck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to read I radio for up to date information and be sure to follow red eye radio and tough tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter\nInstagram and Twitter for information on tour stop of events and promotions if you see this truck take a picture posted on Instagram and be entered to win great prices at hashtags attack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you there's never a bad time to get your top back which\n[noise] man have you heard about transportation nation dot com what's transportation nation dot com transportation eastern dot com it's fucking first news and entertainment website like Netflix\nYou can watch brand new original trucking shows and videos me just for us truckers and you won't find it anywhere else all the transportation nation dot coms trucking shows in videos or on demand so you can watch whenever you want\nOr you have to do is sign up and start watching plus it's free that's perfect I'm going to go check out transportation nation dot com right now\n\nArizona is news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F.

to the right for generation in Washington ... reporting\nAnd let's talk a bit about this tonight in the context of a gentleman who's written a most interesting book David Kaplan is the former legal affairs editor at Newsweek were recovered the court for a decade\nAnd he's written a number of uh uh important books of the day the latest which would be the most dangerous branded as published by crowded subtitle\nInside the Supreme Court was sold on the constitution or David good evening good to have you with us tonight good to be with you uh what the assault are you speaking of in particular here\nWell I argue in the book that the court has been to interventionist too involved in American Life for half a century or in cases that liberal sometimes\nLast night that was what ... mine's zip right when you know it was five for five or okay I was where I was led\nBy Justice Kennedy with chief justice Roberts close behind a project of the current chief justice is to deregulate campaign finance entirely and I think the positions hypocritical if you preach respect\nFor legislatures and the Democratic process\nAs chief justice Roberts did so eloquently and two thousand Fifteen in that same sex marriage case a burger filled why doesn't that apply for campaign finance regulation his argument would be but it's conclusively because the first amendment says otherwise but as Elana Kagan's pointed out you're just weaponized sing\nThe first amendment and listen the we we could you and I could debate this for an entire semester right this is what law schools\nAre students debate it's what constitutional scholars debate but the rest of my book I dunno scholar I'm just a journalist with a law degree who worked at Newsweek for Twenty years is that on balance we've lost sight of why we have a democracy and I was struck by\nBoth in two thousand sixteen when ... when Justice Scalia died\nAs well as during the first round of the Kavanaugh hearings there were lots of questions about abortion and presidential power there was barely\nAny discussion at all about the role of the court and nobody would say judge Kavanaugh when you think the court did best by not getting involved that's not asked him to discuss the specific case it so when there's the court best do its job\nNot intervening ... thousand sixteen liberals and conservatives Republicans Democrats all agreed before\nSchool his body had even cool ... that the next justice could determine American social policy for a generation why do why do the rest of us all\nAcquiesce in that kind of power for the court\nAll I viewed question will come back and talk about it just a moment\nI'm going to tell you something personal I take ...\nAnd it's so amazing it makes me want to tell strangers on the

former legal affairs editor at Newsweek the author of the most dangerous branch\nPublished by crowd you might say the this was a ... a ... book weighty yes ponder is no\nFor example page two hundred twenty five there's an old joke among state judges saint Peter is running things at the brigades when three doctors arrive and ask to be let in\nWho are you in St Pete harassed the first I was a

questioned saint Peter asks what about you\nLike I address you don't need me here actually we do they beat her answers we need someone to talk to God he thinks he's a Supreme Court justice I like it now and\nThen I Would say I would say in my defense that the last hundred pages of the book is just an index and footnotes or what not to the book isn't quite as thick as are with us or otherwise appear\nThat is true but it's kind of book I must say that a debate tournaments I used to actually wave a book like this after the audience ah when I Would make a blatant assertion [noise] and and by implication people would think that I was quoting the book but I digress a uh this this is\nHim a chapter titled revenge of the right and it was the chapter about the two thousand presidential election now given your central concern here about this most dangerous branch I'd be curious your thoughts about that because we had reached a point at which somebody\nHad to say something did they not and and was not the Supreme Court the natural place to turn\nNo this is the easiest question of the mall Bush Gore was the worst decision of the court since Dred Scott in a ... each have a civil war Bush Gore was the easiest case\nI'm a at a at to stay out of because the twelve amendment to the constitution explicitly states that when there's a disputed presidential election it's up to Congress to decide and after\nThe disputed presidential election of Eighteen Seventy probably something not discussed on the show much\nCongress passed a law further stating\nHowever disputed presidential election\nOr should he should should play out and the court back then considered giving the Supreme Court or oh this was easy an originalist a troll ritual is ... you know reading the words in the constitution and in the statute ... would agree in a heartbeat this was not a matter\nFor the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court got involved because she could that's the problem the problem is we assume that we need the Supreme Court to save us we had a system set up for what to do\nIndeed got your word but in what you I gather think is a chaotic situation of the country given what was going on in Florida wasn't chaotic it was democracy in full bloom you had a tight election\nIn the country in Florida and it was up to the Florida courts and the Florida Legislature to fight it out and if they couldn't resolve it it would go to Congress that the system we set up who didn't Supreme Court justices think they are with Justice Kennedy and the lead saying\nArrogant ... it's it's our responsibility\nTo decide and you know in the years afterwards Justice Scalia would often say when he was asked at a law school or on C SPAN money or show perhaps why did you get involved and Justice Scalia would say with a smart we were the laughing stock of the world who bought us\nI've checked my constitution many times I Can't find a national laughing stock clause\nNo there is that's not a basis on which to get involved\nYou your point is again very well taken have a call from Joel in Johnson City Tennessee for David Kaplan author of the most dangerous branch good evening Joe\nOh
