as Sunday\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between felt that you know if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure as being done by the campaigns right and you would have the better you know a better guest sat that right yeah it it gets here\nIt is a a a Dems mid term advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP these seven point gap is narrowing from a twelve point kept the Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk about likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking\nAbout this it has changed since the Kavanaugh confirmations leading up to ... cents I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's\nMotivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the rights is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I watch it on the might call before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because my was not driven to call based on what we had said and therefore he you know became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion\nAbout the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and his feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we ever started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike ... I don't think honestly\nNow we've covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to mankind and we do think that we have looked at more or as investigators in partisan\nAnd we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warrant in and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already the only evidence of colluding with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving the money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS it gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious on verified information\nOr I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin right so the only people that colluded in any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um it it could it is\nIt an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who really brought to light\nAmericans are conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it\nBut\nIt could be there again is that underlying motivator that's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that\nThey then alleging all this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president uh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing\nI think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now\nI don't I don't see it I look I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included\nA ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thinking how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's partly what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month in the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference\nIn keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion\nRight or the mall or investigation at all or not\nAnd see I don't know what a a a more report does the if the if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would ah issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the midterm\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not as that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't ... you might get out of a report I don't think they do it's it's incomplete um what I Know what the report right now it's not going to even talk about that and and that's that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even gonna talk about the possibility of Trump looting with the Russians I I just\nBecause where where it would be the evidence if there's not going to be in the movement on a dime\nIf it is just to report a chrysalis over at CNN a former Washington Post I ride that you know where he said you know I think it's a it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while\nIt's it's ultimately just got to be a report it's really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing\nEntering were coming out of us probably will never see this ... right because in and that'll be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's not a delight to be done the last two years yet accusations gone just as\nAn owner except for the fact\nThat you have the I.

bosses\nNever had your job you know some people get promoted into being a boss but they never actually had the job that they used to say I don't even know what it takes to do their jobs that the

her know what it is that you're doing all the time so here's how to do it it's really it's really simple but I you you see people don't really do that's okay they'll get a face to face meeting with the boss put it on the calendar sit down for half an hour\nAnd an avid meeting about how you can work effectively together right I mean ideally you do this when you start a new job but I think it's worth doing it and your current job paying when it made about how we can work effectively together\nAnd then during that meeting ask your manager how they want to be kept in the loop you know hey I'd love to um give you some regular status updates you say you always know I'm here in the loop about what I'm doing it must be like okay that sounds great I'd I'd love to know what you're doing\nYou can
