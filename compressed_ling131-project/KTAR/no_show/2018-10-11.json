a the grow as fast as this thing did and it absolutely has\nTo be a store three days ago [noise] not a hurricane and grew and grew as rapidly as anything they've ever seen\nIt has but here's my question and I've got lots of listeners out there in Florida I've got 'em over the country is is the fatigue\nThere right like I talked to a lot of listeners\nToday who who's you know and I've got a couple of friends in Georgia and we tax back and forth and I asked them I said are you worried\nAnd they said you know it's a nuisance it's it's it's a nuisance it's awful and and this thing is bigger and and you know maybe the the boy who cried wolf because too often we think it's the biggest most horrendous thing and then we'd find out it's really not people get frustrated\nOr the fact is this is not one of those situations where it's not going to be a waste and palm trees and stuff it is ugly it is nasty and it is it is it is ferocious\nBut when I talk to people there are um like that like this is part of living here right part of living here as we get the beautiful weather throughout the year and we get to live and enjoy all of this stuff we've got the beach in the sunshine and all of these kinds of things and there's some stuff that goes with it like everywhere else\nAnd it is it is it is crazy but this thing has picked up steam and it started out as a storm thought I was gonna be tropical storm our big thing we talked about yesterday was as it rolls on and is it going to do it in the Carolinas which is essentially stole right there and the Trump just copious amounts of water just drop it everywhere just dump it everywhere\nA and the next thing you know it intensified and it went from a tropical storm to a two and then we're looking at a forward a potential five\nWarm

right\nI mean it's it's it's not like it's not going to happen again I can tell you right now in the future there will be more hurricanes maybe some this year maybe not for five or ten years but there

that that America's does doesn't really care but you're right and it is not an American doesn't care is not that I don't care anybody listening doesn't care what it is is kind of accept that risk that you live there were behind you but\n\nIt's like\nHow sorry to people want us to be mean does anybody really care if there's a massive earthquake in California it'll be on the news and maybe that that first one may get some love but fires the fires that devastated the west\nSome of them are still raging by the way and they've been for months some of them are still going they're still trying to put the handle on some of the fires\nIt's one of those things could you imagine a three month hurricane\nSo it's it's one of those things where as Americans we kind of figure out okay where can we put our love and that's why it last year was so big with the damage in Houston all that stuff because it hasn't happened for a while but these arrests that everybody takes to live in certain places\nAnd one

the most are those who have lots of flights in the south east mainly delta American and the regional carriers Atlanta's airport have seen some cancelled flights because they fly down to Tallahassee in Pensacola all flights in and out of many Florida Panhandle airports were pre cancelled and passengers knew they wouldn't be flying today\nYeah yeah it's going to be tough will say along that\nUh how long Michael sticks around because the big fear a lotta times was storms and you talk to do do a lot of these people in my\n... my best friend just got back from the Carolinas he got back on I think Saturday and now he's getting ready to go out to Florida he's an insurance adjuster goes out and check things he says the thing that's the worst thing that happened it's not the when all the debris and depending on how hard it is that causes issue it's the flooding\nThe massive flooding that does the massive damage and that's that that is this going to move quick and dissipate as it gets out over into the land or is it going to hang out and that was the fear originally as we talked about yesterday was Michael was going to come is going to be category too but we'll bring a ton of precipitation and just kind of hang\nOut and dump a ton of water and then all of a sudden overnight it went from a tropical storm to category two to ...\nWe're approaching category four and five so

the thing is going to get your vote\nAre going to say you're not talking about the issues that they will talk about on the news all the time the Russia investigation of some sort [noise] you don't watch us [laughter]\nNo they don't and look I get it you know Donald Trump captured all of a a generation of people that followed him because he made\nPolitics simple\nHe spoke plane he came out he was a bit rough around the edges and even though he was a billionaire people can relate to him he kept that simple stupid I get that\nBut they were trying to understand and I understand that somebody like you know Instagram influence there is this stuff and that's what they are the influences can influence people to do things and it's great that you want to be a part of it but the reporter for the reason\nYou know you're thirty seven year old man it's got a small business and a wife and a couple of kids you're saving up for college and she's in school part time and she's working fulltime and you've got a small business you may not understand the ins and outs of committees and culture and stuff like that\nBut you understand why you're voting and ... and and you don't understand that the the the weirdness of the politics and the rules and the and the other and that's where Trump came in\nAnd I get the fact that she's got to influence the issues are why are you doing it\nWhy do you have to be coaxed into doing it and that\nTo me was the issue and I love with this person says and this sums it all up about the generation that will do\nAnything for this could be your first election [noise]\nAnd ultimately you can decide whether or not the house of representatives democratic or Republican control\n[noise] are you thinking about what\nI'm currently maybe if I took more time like inform about like what's going on right now I'm On the are you going to vote where like the most unreliable voter demographics I sent home to like in other words you know well that's what the Democrats won but they can't get on your\nOther people and they're going to keep an eye on\n[laughter]\nYeah but you know what tell them all they want they may even go register and they'll be excited about it for thirty seconds\nAnd then it'll fade away because they're on the fourth night there on to school there on the Instagram the wrong to all of the other things the influences out there trying to influence and I have no problem but instead of saying something like hey it's\nMy way what you should be saying is hey get educated understand the issues don't be in a whole do the right thing\nEducate yourself it doesn't take long to educate yourself on certain issues and making real honest decision about something it's vitally important to who we are as the country and where we're going\nOh man it frustrates me that I might\nGo vote for who do I have both parents with no you don't\nWork [noise] touched us be crazy\nI was sitting there last night and I'm and I'm On I'm seeing this and people are all excited and you know and the the Twittersphere in the Instagram and all of this stuff is happening and they're all talking about this and that and people were energized by it and I'm thinking to myself you weren't energized before because you don't care\nAnd sometimes people care too much and you know sometimes I care meters broke my pockets\nFull there's only so much I can care about but if this is what it takes to get you cross the line and you weren't going to cross the line in any other way shape or form\nAnd it needed\nThis have happened I don't want you to vote

years and they vote and they try to get you know caught up quickly in in the world and and they don't have a lot of information or an understanding of politics is crazy and again it's it's so so you
