that anywhere between eight and ten thousand depending on who you're talking to and\nAnd it's you know it's funny\nThis is where like the the crazy right and the crazy left there they've always got the conspiracy theories you know and\nThe [laughter] it's it's for owes the Soros is funding this or it's you know the Democrats have put this together and so what you found ten thousand crisis act or people that are willing to make a treacherous walk\nFrom wherever to here is is that what it is I'm just I'm curious like I'm curious\nAbout I'm not saying that there's not people along the way that aren't there to help but I'm saying how do you go about in doing that how do you get that many people that are willing to to jump on board is their contract you sign\nI'm just you know it's it's curious\nI think we're allowed to be curious I I don't know what's going to happen and they're they're having issues\nSome small towns have taken some people in the custody I don't ... in the overall scheme of things\nBy the time it gets here I don't know how big it is going to be and\nIt's going to be one of these things where this will be a little something for the next few days if that the bombs have overtaken it but eventually unless there's more bombs and they don't unless they find somebody it'll dissipate and then it will become this again and then this will disappear and then it will get bigger as it gets closer\nTo the borders and I said borders because I think eventually it's going to break into bits and pieces and you'll find some staying towards the Texas side some will head towards Arizona some other ones are towards California\nBut I just I I don't know\nI don't know and this is one of those things where it's like as a perfect example where I was talking earlier to somebody of of\nYou know most of the time when I talked to somebody who we differ politically\nOn certain things and I think most of you guys\nIf you you were smart enough to understand that because I like to think that my my my listeners and people to pay attention or smarter than the average bear and even if they're politically they slant to one side and it's pretty solid they're open minded enough you know more often than not we want to get to the same place we just differ on the directions we want to take\nRight\nSome of us want to get there as an individual some of us want to get there on the bus some of us want to get I mean some of us are going to walk there we we want to get a lot of times the same place it's just\nThe way that we the route that we're going to take how we're going to get there and who's going to pay for it along the way\nAnd I think that the more if we start looking at things like hey that's a that's a good you're right we do want to get that we do want good education we do want how I have yet to run in somebody in in on the Republican side of the aisle if you will but says oh I Would like for for nobody to have health care\nI think everybody would like to for everybody to have health care it's just the way that they want it done is they like the individual to be a part of this and they understand but there are people out there that are capable for whatever reasons in certain circumstances that they're never going to be able to themselves and\nThey got no problem and the other side is like well everybody should have and we don't want the same thing it's just how do we pay for it how do we get\nThe other side is like well everybody should have and we don't want the same thing it's just how do we pay for it how do we get there what's the best route to take where's the compromise in the same thing for immigration I've yet to meet anybody on the left except wackos\nWho won't open borders right\nIt's just different and how they want to enforce these things it's it's the same you know it's it's that kind of issue we\nShould be talking about our cars okay we we agree that we shouldn't have this so how do we go about fixing three two three five three twenty four twenty three actually had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you each and every day\nIn the United states of America at this very same time we like to roll something out to you that just lands at your feet and it's even got a handle and you can pick it up and you can use it how you will we called us or urban where does the day\nIt's half of the urban word of the day I Am\nThe topic a little more on the street ... can't understand a word your science for\nNow this was very interesting I was like oh wait what because I heard this I\nAm a ginger right so ... you know the red headed person that changes the genes used but somebody\nSaid to me [noise]\nI heard this I'm like what is this like it's each rancor ranger I'm like what is that they're like oh that's another word for changer like wait wait how did you get to do to how does this happen for for ginger but like yeah you didn't know that I'm like you know\nYour yeah your ranger I'm like with a W [noise]\nThat means you're a ginger I'm like I have no idea you guys come up with stuff every day I'm so glad I get a loop every once in a while [noise] ranger your urban word of the day\nThank you for saying that in dated urban planning so that our understanding that there was an urban were other day we damn stress shore cranium\nIt but I Will say that they said you're a ranger kinda ranger like because it also means somebody with ... and ... and I never had ... now I did get a\nKnock on the line there but I didn't have painted now my sister she had red hair and she had the ... and when she got like\n... when she got signed oh goodness me she just went she with super frankly I never had that issue three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet at us so your bombs mega millions gone but\nIf you're not okay so it wasn't that big a jackpot but now you're thinking that you really could have used that more than six hundred million dollars would last night's Powerball drawing\nWell you get another chance knowing matched all of the numbers in the multi state lottery that means Saturdays jackpot grows to an estimated seven hundred fifty million bucks\nYeah so a lot of money right I mean it's not that kind of money\nBut it's a pretty it's a pretty big amount of money crazy right I drove by today\nThat said seven hundred and fifty million on this thing but the other one always said forty million the mega mines like oh that's kind of sad three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows you where you can tweet us\n... Megan Kelly right you thought you were talking about costumes the next thing you know ... you're on your way out of here talk about that ... [noise]\n\n... adventure and show [noise]\nDid you know you can vote with your dollars by switching to patriot mobile patriot mobile is so much more than just a cell phone company they stand up against the crazy liberal agenda every day by donating to conservative causes patriot mobile provides nationwide reliable service with unlimited talking tax for less money and no hidden fees\nSo they do that\nYou had a lot of people were on there that were jealous over who weren't huge fans of her anyways and she came from that place that dirty place that dirty\nEvil place it's on the ride that dirty even play so she'd you must be taking\n\nSo she's going to get sixty nine million dollars or what's left of her six million dollar contract to walk away to negotiating a settlement and and\nSo she's going to get sixty nine million dollars or what's left of her six million dollar contract to walk away to negotiating a settlement and and the settlement may go she'll get\nIf you do thirty five they may say we'll give you twenty five but we won't restrict you and what you were able to do meaning you could go back to Fox which is what the rumors on the street they have been a negotiation for this and the thing is it's her numbers weren't good\nWinning so a lot of things we forgive people\n\nAnd I look at this and say the way that the people at NBC has come after says to me\nA lot that maybe she was in his lights\nThere as\nShe would like to have been some of that may be the fact that they just couldn't stand her\nAnd others might be her attitude was horrible and so because if your loved and you do something and your numbers are good people are more apt to forgive you and also people are more apt to come out on your behalf and say oh this is stupid I Know so and so I haven't heard a lot of that\nI have\nNow do I think it's ridiculous of course I absolutely don't you I mean can you be honest with yourself that you kind of thing is a little ridiculous right that you kind of just a smidgen like this is major of of insanity in something like this but we live in a world now where this is what it's all about it's all about\nPunishing people it's all about the punishment how can I punish you what can I Do to destroy you I don't just want to\nGet you to apologize I Want to destroy you I Do and here's the other thing she comes out she starts to show off like this\nI'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nYou may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness\nAnd Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it'd ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another black person making their faith later or white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume and wound okay\nWell I was wrong and I am sorry\nAnd I thought to myself who you apologizing to\nCurious we see all these stars come out and apologized like Roseanne had a human being she should've apologized right when she did that tweet so you understood that\n\nBut you apologizing to\nAnd that's that's one of those like we we want everybody we we demand everybody apologize\nRight Samantha be does what she does do a bunker Trump you need to apologize to her doing whatever way you want you want to come out but the whole may cope with the world is if okay good because I couldn't go to work unless I got that apology\nBecause I was underneath the bed curled up in a fetal position terrified for my life but now that you've apologized whoever you are apologizing for for whatever you did aids okay\nThank God oh my God I was\nSo worried [laughter]\nThis is the stupidest thing in the world is like when when nor McDonald was going to go on uh the tonight\nShow and then people came up and they had reservations about him coming on after the whole ... thing and there were people that were well they were they were visibly shaken up but I think if you're visibly shaken up by what nor McDonnell had to say you need to go get yourself some help\n\nYou need to get yourself some help\n\nYou don't understand what don't I understand\nThat a celebrity who you've never met\nSaid something that you don't agree with and because of that you're upset to the point of visibly shaken has anybody listening ever been visibly shaken up to the point where you could not potentially do your job whatever that job is because somebody tweeted something said something\n\nAnd I'm not talking about your wife or your husband your girlfriend your boyfriend your son your dog whatever I'm Talking about a celebrity\nHave you ever been and felt that you were owed an apology [laughter] never\nPut his Avila I Will ask you have you ever felt you were owed an apology for something by somebody who was famous no out there we go so there's two of us I'm sure somebody's got to join me ... you just don't understand [noise] no I don't that's why I Want you to explain it to me I Want you to it's\nSomebody's got to join me Chad you just don't understand [noise] no I don't that's why I Want you to explain\nIt to me I Want you to explain it to me\nAnd I ... but this is the power and and here's what it is and make no doubt about it is a power play\n\nFor a lot of these things NBC did not she struggles just\nBeen at NBC right her her show and her numbers of kind of been in the bumper\nThere and part of that is because in many ways she type cast herself as the person who was on the right and the whole nine yards and because she was on Fox so by default that was going to happen\nBut also because she dealt with a lot of political stuff that not everybody wants to come on your show that that trust you because of Fox 'cause they're all caught up in you know this crap so\nThat was a bit of an issue so nobody really got a lot of people couldn't see past\nThat point of who she was\nSo her coming and saying let's talk about recipes or let's talk about online dating people aren't buying that\nEven though that's what she probably want to do she wants to be the next Barbara Walters the reality is is people never got past\nSome of that and I don't think she was from what I understand and this is only a couple\nOf people that are that have worked there a is across the board she was not liked some people were jealous because of the massive salary and felt like whoa we were here and this is what you're doing\nAnd other people were like she wasn't really love there and she didn't really and Gracie it herself on a lot of people and she wasn't super humble about it and she made her presence known and sue [noise]\nYeah [noise] I don't know a lot to it\nThree two three five three eight twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter somebody's totally gonna tax means\nTo you know what I felt I was deserved and apology I've never felt like I deserved and apology for anything you don't want to you deserve an apology\nIs one that star or a celebrity does a movie and it sucks and the album socks and like look we're sorry that sucked\nSo we'll do better next time I'm like oh you don't have to apologize but that's nice right or when you go to a like like how many times you seen this your team sucks it stinks they're horrible Arizona Cardinals right now\nLike they owed apology to a lot of people who pay good money to go watch them and they've they've really not done well there's an apology there I can understand that we apologize to the fans and I because they pay good money to come here and we let them down because we were all\nRight okay okay I maybe understand that but\nI ... when when somebody comes out and apologizes I'm like who [laughter]\n... is there is there's somebody in particular Valerie Jarrett and and and Roseanne I get that but\nThat was to her it's not like everybody else was like oh good we got our politics right Valerie good 'cause if you're not good and we're not good\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three that she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at me\nSleeping is vulnerable I like to do it and one of the things

Politico\nHouse Republicans frame Thursday's private interview with former Trump campaign advisor\nGeorge Papadopoulos is further evidence that there is no solid justification\nFor special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation Papadopoulos of foreign policy advisor to president Donald Trump's twenty sixteen campaign began an hours long meeting with members of the house judiciary and oversight and Government Reform committee he's behind closed doors Thursday morning with Congress in recession until after\nThe midterm elections however only three members were present Mark Meadows John Ratcliffe both Republicans and change we're asking of Maryland medals called Papadopoulos a critical witness noting that he's\nThe person who supposedly was the whole reason that we have this Russian collusion investigation going on Papadopoulos was loose talk\nOr overseas about Russians having dirt on Hillary Clinton prompted a an FBI investigation into election interference what we're finding out\nA without talking about specific ... what is going on is the whole reason that this investigation was opened\nUp was certainly not built on a solid foundation metals told reporters he added that some Justice Department an FBI staffer should be referred to the department of justice's office of professional responsibility to determine whether proper protocol was followed and I'm certainly willing to encourage that\nThe Republicans and Democrats are painted partisan portraits of Papadopoulos as a witness Ratcliffe describing him as very forthcoming he's providing as much information as he has Ratcliffe said I think he's trying to understand how what Twenty one year old or to me at twenty eight year old\nA campaign advisor who'd been on the job for less than a month has been embroiled in the highest profile investigation in recent times\nHis testimony here today is certainly unique an eye opening and very different in terms of what I had come to understand from other interviews seen it from other interviews that we've had as it relates to FBI agents and department of justice officials metal says\nTo see it from his perspective gives me great pause and concern raskin meanwhile reminded reporters a Papadopoulos his conviction he pleaded guilty last month to lying to the FBI about his communications with the foreign professor and was sentenced to fourteen days in federal prison\nHe pleaded guilty last month to lying to the FBI about his communications with a foreign professor and was sentenced to fourteen days in federal prison suggesting his testimony should be taken with a grain of salt ah of course I'm\nAs we know there's no evidence of Russian collusion right [laughter] so that's [noise]\nBut ... the ... office can walk in and can obtain those documents and no one can stop them why has doing why hasn't the conservative media from the very beginning talk about the fact of why this went to the inspector general for that the inspector general because we were still we were both on for the first\nTwenty four hours not understand why says inspector joke doesn't make any sense doesn't right\nAnd all of a sudden one day on the air mhm is what I think it was the day after or whatever we said well wait a minute 'cause we're we're we're we're like baffled ... because they were making the explanation is if we can't do this because you could be due dead do damaging\nSome of the top secret store allies and therefore we're giving it to the inspector general more like why why would you get to the inspector general if\nYou were oh wait a minute the inspector general mhm looks at corruption you believe there's ...\nA a because if you look at the the\nThe scenario and the great possibility of how this went down it wasn't our foreign uh out it was it wasn't our allies it wasn't you know Great Britain or anyone else that was that was starting this in order to derail trumpet it happened here at home\nWhich means that someone in the Justice Department in this case I quite possibly was was beginning this entire thing so worrying about what our allies are concerned with really wouldn't concern the inspector general's office at all not\nAt all will try to keep you updated on it right because we know that our listeners want to be constantly updated on that and that's why I said I'm getting constant communication people getting frustrated saying what's going on\nYou know I thought they might use this with the midterms are coming up now the inspector general now that they're\n... it's outside of the authority now of Congress because the inspector general right as a part of the executive branch so whether the Democrats take the house or not is not going to stop the inspector general right but one wonders that before we lose\nIf we do the if the Republicans lose the house that this all stops just investigation stops\nSo you better if they win you better get as much information out as possible you want out to the American public ... otherwise the fear is it will be buried mhm and the American public will not know the truth because of the Democrats and nobody's ever argue this when we have said this\nThe Democrats actually do not

really wasn't a dry your two hundred and ... yeah that's what I mean you agree but you get a chilling now look at all of the probably not but up until now look at all the attention for Steve Bannon right once he was gone for the White House I was like\nAnd as we said before the true growth and if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent\nUh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democrat president or the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the true expansion of well\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy is doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a\n... growth rate of of two point five six percent up from the two point two percent from the Obama administration\nThe point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels which drives the majority of\nThe private sector increase in GDP that's still what driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector it's still not as much as government spending right since April of of twenty Seventeen\nThat's how much you know we have increased government spending over the last roughly year and a half\nWhen that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism from people who used to agree with us but now disagree with us\nOn the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost in good in the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple and so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade\nAnd about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services when we've talked about the president\nAnd the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what what he believes he has done to the car industry which will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder\nTo sell that product made in the United states overseas\nWhich was what the president claimed he wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president does all over the place and when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well\nAs we are break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so\nAnd the way that there's this long lead and then they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then his actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty so what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the growth is in the private sector\nOr where the lack of growth\nIs in the ... in the ... that you do yes you you do have to\nSeparate the two because government spending even for\nA quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not ... it's not why you do it but also that is\nThe majority of that money mhm of increase in that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the that we are putting on future generations\nSo the economic impact overall may help now but down the line the burden of the debt is going to hurt one works against the other one the other thing is the multiplier effect\nIs not the same as in the private sector\nBecause a multiplier effect in the private sector is if you build something that makes somebody else else's life more efficient or makes their business more efficient they use it and it's the combination of building that good in service and the increased productivity along that private sector in line that really boost\nIt really is the true economic engine that that shows that you are having an economic growth thinking assume our society thinking a smartphone yes you know\nLike it is so that that is that that great demand because it's at that because\nIt's\nCreate that efficiency and society and and and productivity increased productivity and that's where you see again that multiplier a big create that huge expansion in wealth and and ripple out you're not going to you're not going to see that with defense spending\nWell defense spending you will build the initial product mhm but the initial product is used for what that's the cost of doing business mhm what your ... and so yeah we understand how that helps the GDP but you're creating something\nYou're using debt down the road it's where yes in the ... the funding ... write long term debt to to pay for it but then that actual good or service is not used in the private sector to improve the efficiency\nAnd productivity of other businesses down the line\nIt stays there and it becomes a a burden of the cost of doing business on an entire economy yes\nAnd that um indifference you could make a a very indirect a link to it and say that it preserves capitalism in general yeah in the roll right but it but that does not have the same immediate effect that the private sector\nMultiples are do and that and that and that's why when you look and that's why when we bring up the tariffs and the cost of\nHome building now when the cost of of of timber because those terrorists from what I Know ... until the deal is signed are still on with ah with with Canada the increase you you're talking about the two biggest drivers of of when you talk about what ... what the consumer marketplace of drive the economy it's housing and cars\nBoats have been targeted by terrorists ...\nWe haven't even talked about food yet and what a drag that might be down on the road and the big terrorist Evan even hit yet\nAnd that's why we are we are so concerned with the direction of this White House when it comes to economics and I have no idea where has has the ... Congress talked about and ... about what they're going to do with the new NAFTA there's been I don't know I well zero talk on\nWhat happens if you because they want to get this\nDone soon and what happens when the house if the house goes to the Democrats\nYou know can they get this thing done by the end of December can they get this through\nThe end it because we're talking about what to the Republicans have they feel about it right we're not we're not rich or young even forget about what we talk about the the house turning blue\nWe have to talk about and that they the Republicans right now and given or of assuming that they might try and vote on it by the end of the year\nAnd so you have to ask what are the plans because the steel and aluminum tariffs still stay in place right\n\nAnd serials was in ... you're you're seeing some of the earnings reports coming out from major\nCompanies um a number of them uh the that was\nA certain ... or or that came out uh and\nI'm a number of them\nAre the that was a certain ... or or that came out a and you had Ford you had a with their with their foreign sales as a result of brutality retaliatory tariffs a caterpillar and others\nThat are talking about business losses as a result of the terrorist situation but material cost I mean what about all the smaller companies\nAnd we talk about the contractors you know Lockheed Martin is a given right but there are many smaller companies that are included in that tire process hundreds of ... hundreds of company and the same with manufacturing right on the on the private sector side with terrorists\nThe material costs we started hearing from a you know the makers of appliances washers and dryers and everything else\nAre you and I both about the same time went through a the the uh water heater a purchase a few weeks apart from each other and we were both told by you know the powers that did the job\nThe costs are about to go up I Know for a fact I I have a family member who's in the commercial H. back business and their costs are going up the businesses is still doing strong\nBut that cost cannot be denied and the question is what impact overall does it have

place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse in\nA place where are you going to be totally scared and and ah you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a park and\nOff for the kids and of course you got the ... do you uh Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes or over the other thing uh some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations have the ...\nWhich is your cleric classic scare zones all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the ... the the sewer soles in er which is layer and places like that um\nAnd of course the the point has got hollow ah weekends\nOr with the great pumpkin fest that goes on there are ... high school shows the entertainment is absolutely amazing my daughter actually had to audition for one of these shows at Six Flags are and are they really are they really get into this big time or I mean even the chain stores\nSound extremely we'll plus even changed the names of the rides sometimes\nAre for example over its heroines a which is that Carol wins in Charlotte North Carolina uh they've got an actual fleet street uh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows\nAnd zombies and ... and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters are\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this or and or they're just uh yeah the rise are still open the weather is fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's ... basically Anaheim a we mentioned to the ...\nLights over Kenny would on how the screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens are and of course ... and he's not so scary Halloween all these places that we've mentioned plus others um during the day you know during the day it really isn't like that or it all happens pretty much\nThere's a during the day you know during the day it really is it like that\nOr it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and there's ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places you you have kids in there and they're pretty frightened you probably don't want to go at night to these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zone their actual zones\nWhere you'll you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the mazes and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will or will tell you it ... it ... easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or or having a kid had a traumatic experience with that\nPart of the way that the lawyers have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call a lawyer\nAbsolutely I mean at the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and now there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know they're they're probably not going to\nTry to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gal or or something along those lines so you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know it ... if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I like uh he's in he's in parts of what they do and how they train people\nIn order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many uh and again there are there are there are scarce zones and there are ... are you know if you're going into a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nAnd when we come back and to take a look at that in greater detail in just a moment\nArizona news news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F.

what extent a pizza view go have we become jaded and all of this that is to say uh you have to constantly come up with new things that the the been there done that syndrome is that something that plagues the people who who will run the thrill rides\nWell that's the that's the key I mean going back to the Y. Bosch animal that you rode over a um I guess as to be at least\nThirty years ago in order to do that or you know from now take here um you know people that love to ride roller coasters or or or get you know that that that Russia or whatever you want to call it um they want well of course they're going to go higher they want to go faster and the manufacturers have a real problem because\nYou want to keep your writers conscious during the entire ride on their body in\n[laughter] so so you really have to to walk the line and of course with computer technology now uh it's actually a lot better know how many how much cheaper for so many G forces body can take\nNot a pilot somebody who's experienced and trained to do that and in good physical shape so that's the big key is\nTo be able to make it stimulating exciting at the same time but not a you know have any problems or have any negative effects that are that occur and that's why stimulation rides there actually is very big these days\nAnd what I mean by that is the track never actually really moves\nWhat happens is you actually have you with a three D. or forty glasses or you actually sit in in a compartment or that looks like it's actually moving for example storing is a classic example over at Disney where you think you're actually on hang glider and and being a pilot I can tell you it looks very real\nOr that this is all happening so the simulation right take much smaller footprint there are a little less money uh but at the same time you can get that same impression and if you don't like the right just close your eyes and it pretty much all goes away\nInteresting ah if you buy that we've never experience these are these the virtual environments that they can be pretty intense I I have a chance to do that a number of years ago and I can only imagine how much a better they've gotten with the passage of time [noise]\nDo any of the thrill rides a emulate a a real life version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters and what about video games\nIf version of let's say a video game but we mentioned a movie like a like a ghost busters and what about video games\nWell not necessarily video games because I'm their life since then and then there are certain details that you need to to follow but but you didn't mention ah like sitcoms like The Simpsons for example or or or different events like ... of course the movie you'll find that a universal studios\nAh but as far as an actual mimic it it does mimic what goes on in fact nowadays the big thing happens to be on the old would roller coaster that really are not intense\nWhat you do is you put on the board the glasses and they cover your entire face a wire going through a small a roller coaster and feeling the wind in the breeze and to your face\nOr what you're getting is you're actually getting a simulation ride or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour and goes up and down maybe a little bit\nAs now more intense also that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from ... in Dallas on the jumbo have showed one eight six six five oh Jim bow and our guest Pete tribute go Hi

then\nThat's an interesting thought utterly of to say the least uh and encouraging one of the safety in general a tribute goes that some people it's practiced and all of these are major theme parks and ah and scary rides\nYesterday that absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park is directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidents of problems that occurred at a particular place again you very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen\nIt'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News or one of the major networks because it becomes a
