I mean does that will be there's like invested ... million dollars what do I put it to invest it I said that's thirty five percent of everything I like\nIf I put it in Germany at trial or the German uh and were shipped to that down and we're seeing a massive\nA diversion of a foreign direct investment [noise] out of your it did I get a for starters there was a a five hundred billion dollars half a trillion dollars in the last six months which was earnings by American companies\nOverseas and we used to have a lot until the Republican tax reform\nThat punished you if you brought laid back that states they left it oversees this maybe three trillion dollars to the left over Shays I'm partly because largely because our tax policy said we will hurt you it's going to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay ah so ...\nSlate because our tax policy said we will hurt you it's going to bring the money back and if you don't bring it back that's okay ah show three trillion stock overseas because our tax policy and we said you know what we're not doing that anymore if you earn money in states with tax yet but if you're in print French people take some\nAnd then we have got to bring up a holiday America good they'll ... they'll probably no penalty for bringing back a bit about that as a\nWe've seen a tremendous again half a trillion dollars by it and come back the last six months and an apple they said look we have two hundred and Ninety billion dollars of earnings overseas they ... billion right back\nAnd said you know what because it's no longer had allies to boot buddy from London to New York or Texas um\nWe've read all back now to talk on the act but right now they leave that in the London back because it doesn't matter in terms of our access to capital whether it's in London or in Arkansas are whereas before it did\nShow that money might as well are ready to be back but we've seen a half to try and come back a lead it late and we'll see more as a as we move forward\nAdded that guy's overseas you know German and French people and Brazilians making decisions are shelling that money to the United states rather overseas is really irritating your pets because we're much more competitive\nThan we used to be and that's been a big help\n[noise] yeah I Know I can see why is it just seems so obvious all these things seem so obvious to me I have a couple of more questions and we're going to get some of the callers questions for you also but\nRight now we're going to take her get our national forecast for um detracts\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots of showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nAnd again for Texas but the good news there is showers won't be wrapping up today mainly for central and north central Texas we're going to get about another inch of rain today\nCalled the phone and said if they did if you didn't withhold taxes out of their paycheck every two weeks\nSince dad once a month we said send the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send the check for the whole year and the ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the the paper ours right he said there'd be a revolution it\nOr not they would think if someone had a right you know check my little one ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or any of these days with\nBarry yeah it make it clear that it's like hey\nYeah let's go I promised a color to mark in Albuquerque New Mexico you're on with mark and with Grover Norquist\nThanks ... I'll tell you what you just to work right out of my mouth and here's what I've always thought flat tax and it's ... percent a\nCross support it don't matter whether you're a Warren Buffett or whether you're the guy work down there like Donald seven percent you'll eliminate every deep Doug shoot that there is\nAs far as they are with tech fuel eliminate all federal tax whether it's the fuel tax that we pay or whether Social Security\nIncome tax you name it if it's a federal tax it no longer exists you will limit the sixteenth bad but and that in order to raise taxes if you're going to do it as Congress that\nMeans you have to have a super majority of both the house in the Senate to foot the bill on the\nPresident's desk for him to sign up\nFor it be for it to be come a balanced\nStill on the president's desk for him to sign up for it be for it to be come a ballot or election of on every two\nYears that's what they're going to do and it requires a super majority of all register voters in order for the taxes the ratings\nAnd I think you know and as you just mentioned uh it does it come out of your pay check you write the check\nEvery month or every quarter and believe me when people realized how much they're paying out taxis they would they would there would be a revolution in this country like you would not believe 'cause I was self employed\nAnd I had to write that check every quarter I couldn't believe how much I was having to pay taxes\nInteresting Grover what do you think of that to his idea\nI think he's right and a number of the ideas you put out there are in state constitutions or in California in Nevada or if you if the government wants to raise taxes state government wants to raise taxes\nIt's a two thirds voted legislature because taxes are about as permanent as constitutional amendments which usually take two thirds\nOr to impose on people\nAnd if you say it takes two thirds to raise taxes it really slows with the tax and spend down doesn't stop completely but it really slow it down it has to be a really good idea it has to have broad support a to an act and it I think\nA flat tax with a super majority to raise taxes\nUh would dramatically change our policy curious\nWhat do you think about some people would pose the sales tax consumption tax so what's your response to that\nWell in Europe they have a value added tax which is a sales tax at every step of production if you're going to have a twenty percent sales tax is on the Afghan countries do you really have to you can't just collect it at the supermarket 'cause everybody would buy their stuff and\nDown the street from the supermarket out the back of a truck\nOr so they put that twenty percent at every level of production the farmer pays that the guy who trucks goods into town pays\nA twenty percent on his value added to where you get ... percent tax\nBut yeah a little ... amounts and there's no one place we can avoid ah the difference between the United states and Europe is Europe\nAnd has a sales tax of a national sales tax a value added tax which gets every level of a production [noise] ah it's why they have higher taxes than we do they have stupid income taxes that high\nIncome taxes you can only get so much money out of the income tax people will quit working they'll work around that\nHide money [noise] um when you add to that the difference between the United States Europe is that we don't have that and they do we don't have a sales tax they do tend to say no no no we want to sweat whether the income tax and have a national sales tax tax\nIn stat well it's kind of what they promised Europeans and the Japanese and the Asians and the and the Africans when they put that in overseas or it will be in addition to it will not be instead of and if we could and I'm for\nBringing that income tax down towards zero I'm\nWhat you want to do is we just spend it not just turn it into a different tax what who cares if you got rid of the income tax and took the exact same amount of money out of ...\nHow would that change anything it's the same amount of money out of your pocket or it it makes you feel better somebody else's writing the check\nEverything you buy from your house cheer car tree or tear food your clothes would cost more but at the taxes would be hidden in that so um I think going to a single rate tax income tax ah and reducing spending is the route to go to that if you got taxes down enough\nThat you could shift from a ten percent income tax too you know a Fifteen Percent sales tax just got it's got to be brought or a bad yeah I I wouldn't mind that but you got to get the government to half its presence size before you could\nRisk that and you really have to have protections how do we know we're not going to end up with both an income tax and the sales tax true many countries have had been hit with that\nAnd there's no incentive in the corner politicians because they get their money campaign contributions right is part of this have you know give me this donations ...\nAll tissues because they get their money campaign contributions right in as part of this have you know give me a this donation someone in a lower your taxes this they don't want to things solved eventually rights would reduce their campaign contributions as we thought on my part\nHaving taxes that are complicated allows politicians to raise money ah to protect people bit by bit where everyone's paying a one percent in the same percentage less ... less opportunities to make money for politicians\nAnd lawyers and accountants maybe my final question for you well maybe I've got two more what about the mission or um how do you know what do you know if if the Democrats ... take the house what do you think about what's going to happen with the tax situation [noise]\nOr if the Democrats take the house there'll be no tax cuts for the next two years or they will do push ups for tax increases that while at least a trillion dollars and higher taxes Hillary ran on raising taxes by a trillion dollars over a decade\nAt least to try and I'm from where we were we cut taxes a trade and a half ... they want to raise them I Try and why we worship that's two and a half trillion dollars in taxes\nFor a decade that they want to increase\nTaxes belly pushing for that I I think with both Trump and the Republican Senate that they will get a tax increase but they'll sit there and say hey if you want the military to get paid will only do that ... only passed a budget\nOr the soldiers and airmen tenant by it if you get made action because they ... they spent two years\nTrying to get a tax increase [noise] um I Hope they will fail that is what I Will be working on 'em but Democrats\nOn the tax issue like teenage boys on a prime day they keep asking for the same thing in different ways they just again and again and again that keep coming back but they weren't one thing going higher taxes\nAre and they will ask that question twenty different ways of the green taxes it will save the\nPlanet that will be\nAnd the taxes that only paid the other people a day while we pack against the same tax increase\nAs always\nMaybe maybe a new Supreme Court tax to pack the court who knows they can come up with anything the quest talk\nAbout it really I didn't hear that yeah yeah yeah\nI hear a lot of us want to get out of it and they want a repeat of breath proposed a tax foreign Grover Norquist president Americans for tax reform of people get in touch with you\nAt our website it's H.

like if there isn't irreparable divide between the members of these two dramatically different ways of life American cities in American farm land has so little in common when it comes to the daily grind political leanings interviews on money and\nWorking hard in this curiosity has come a boom of books about the residents of rural America the latest is like author and journalist Sarah ... marsh\nSo I grew up on a wheat and cattle farm thirty miles west of Wichita\nAnd in some way or the child in the eighties and it can age are in the nineties and by that in our center major technological shifts going on in the country but because of our economic station we didn't have any of those things do and how they're conditioning have cable TV and have a computer in the house or

ways my upbringing on that farm was more like a Nineteen fifties childhood than the two thousands childhood maybe\n... writes about her upbringing and life in rural America in her book heartland a memoir of working hard and being broke in the richest country on earth\nIt was actually a pretty beautiful thing I was a pretty solitary kid by necessity to start sort of geographic isolation but I always had\nAnimals and nature to interact with meanwhile within the walls of our house there was all sorts of strife and dysfunction much of which had to do in my view with economic struggle and so that's part of the story too but you know I it is an experience this\nThing we call rural America that I actually\nFeel quite privileged to have lived in that is an increasingly rare experience an urbanized country\n... book is about growing up on farmland in Kansas but more than being a book about geography it's about what do you just don't like to grow up poor she says she was inspired to write a memoir because of the way she sees America putting such important son wells and status\nI Can't say that in those moments let's say as a child qualifying for\nSchool lunches or as a first generation college student not knowing what the term graduate school man when someone talked about applying to graduate school\nNot having the right clothes and so on those are things that I see now looking back that I did feel discomfort Shane embarrassment I was not necessarily conscious of that I wouldn't have necessarily articulated it that way\nBut the thing is we live in a society that is full of messages for people who struggle financially that that your value and worth is somehow tied to your financial value and worth and if that's the case in the context of capitalism that in my family and I are pretty worthless\nThat's of course the impetus for this book is to provide a sort of corrective of that deeply ingrained social attitude I think that even politically liberal and progressive people I find sometimes hold\nSmart said it was her experience as a college student but really taught or what a disadvantage being from a poor family living in rural America truly was\nI was a first generation college student I had already been working as a teenager for years and really also hustling as a student to work hard for the scholarships that I knew\nBe my only ticket to a college education so by the time I showed up on campus at age Eighteen hours already tired [laughter] and then those years they're double majoring working to make ends meet keeping my grades up to maintain the scholarships that paid for my tuition and and all those things as a financially independent Eighteen year old\nWas you know while for some of my friends they might remember college as the most carefree years of their lives for me they were really the hardest years of my life\nAnd that's the class divide in this country sort of manifest in my life\n... book is about much more than having to work her way through college and not having as much fun as her classmates she says that some members of America as upper class don't recognize the full scope of what it means for others to live in poverty\nThe most crucial thing to point out would be just a very physical nature of poverty and the dangers often mortal ones actually that come with that life so\nI when I was in second grade and my dad\nWho was a farmer and a carpenter do couldn't make ends meet and those two industries for all his hard labor so he took a side job driving ban for a company that basically picked up
