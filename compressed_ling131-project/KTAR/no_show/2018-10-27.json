that direction so I Need to be in this direction\nMarriage equality or traditional marriage right now I'm all traditional I could grow in a few years and depending on which way the wind's blowing or I could be on the marriage equality it's the game that people play and it's that's how it's being used and it's frustrating\nIt is absolutely frustrating or we need to figure out what we're going to do with this and my frustration comes from the sense that we know what's coming\nAnd this is a small thing\nThe caravan compared to the overall but the optics of it or bank\nAnd as they're coming here what we're going to have is two groups of people Republicans and Democrats who are going to argue it's two people reaching for a glass of milk milk falls over\nThe glass falls to the ground one of them says you\nGlass of milk milk falls over the glass falls to the ground one of them says you did that you need to clean it up the other one says no you did that you need to clean it up and then it goes on and on and on and all the while the glass of milk\nAnd\nThe milk itself lays on the floor he doesn't go anywhere and they argue over it and eventually the people arrive and what has been happening will continue to happen and that is the frustration that so many of us feel out there\nThat is it and the Democrats there they play the game they play the game remember what they said and this is what Tucker Carlson said because\nIf they're talking about a wall if you're talking about immigration reform in the way that they don't like you get called certain things\nAn Asian laws it

live south of the Rio Grande\nYeah\nBut we heard what the others said right like you know they shouldn't come here and they just can't\nIt's it's a game it's it's an absolute game and depending on which way the weather and the wind is blowing it's the way that they're going to go uh I don't have any of these people\nI in fact empathize with these people\nIn many ways I can look at it and and think to myself my God we have people who have been stuck in the Midwest and in in in the rust belt for years who can't get off their ashes at times to go hey maybe I Need to go somewhere else where there's actual a work and potential and they'll stay there\nAnd I and I can be honest and say you know I'm not a big fan of maybe you should go somewhere right if it's not working for you there maybe go to another pot\n\nBut they have the right to do that these people don't have a right to come in our country\nSome of these people probably do need asylum I'm not some idiot that they'll take some of these people are some of these people are all just you know some of these people probably are and potential danger because of the corruption because of a lot of stuff that's going on down there the the gang warfare the drugs all that stuff yes all of them\n\nBut it's a game and nobody is going to do anything about it and come December first ... give or take a few days\nThey will arrive some in

I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank\nIt would it would be a bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm I like my life and I don't want to change mhm\nAnd I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I\nA a friend who uh a friend or family member who a bat at one time was working for a a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time in the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener thinks we are\nUm but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on\nSo much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes ah you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else though to know\nI could have lost anyone that do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nYeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because I said you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone or I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nRaising the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you've got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job for out what to do even if you're not going to give it all away that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I liked his life five right now it's like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's play out of a let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I miss this is one dumped ... mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other low we've we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up until today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really I got it it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse that where the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go home to ... that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for it\nSo I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else that become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business\nAnd personal life well you've one point six billion all that goes away and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I have on one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things that I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you\nKnow I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it ah I I I don't know I'll I'll have to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game\nFor two billion dollars and his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a rent just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy and he had nothing in common\nPearl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living at a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was what I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has ... security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against you all the\nTime is one of the that story that I read that you read that you mentioned earlier talked about the guy who won the big lottery ran was actually what the uh kidnapped or some of his family was

I agree with President Obama one hundred percent uh you know we talked about this earlier with the caravan of slowly moving across\nMexico won't be here and time for the uh for for the election if if they ever ah you know get to the border in any type of organized fashion at all if that ever happens\nThey're stopping of bookies in Mexico city that's going to take a few minutes\nUm but as we've said this is the time\nOf weeks before the election to take it to the Democrats to say this was the Democrats now to the Democrats still believe this this is the time to challenge the Democrat leadership and say you keep talking comprehensive immigration reform but you never tell us what you what\nI Believe and so to the American people that you want to open borders if you don't want to open borders well then come to the table and tell me specifically ...\nWhat type of enforcement you will put on the border if you want to plant\nAnd we've talked about the various plans everything from citizenship to amnesty which would be citizenship to legal status without being able to vote right\nIf you got bad than what level of border enforcement would you guarantee the American public please be public and tell me we are willing to keep the door open are you willing to talk or is it\nLike we all believe that your party is the party of open borders and if you are the party of open borders have the guts\nTo sell that to the American people or attempt to sell back to the American people that's what I think the president should say that he's already halfway there with this yep you're now and and by the way you can you can get him you can get Feinstein how many oh you're going hello street right\nThat sounds really over the last Twenty years it sound exactly like Donald Trump does on illegal immigration right exactly why he does make the comparison hit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say\nRight exactly why he does make the comparison hit them hard you've got the bully pulpit as you know the press pays attention to everything that you say hey\nIs depressed fact checking to make sure that Obama really set that are are they just laying low challenge depressed go after the media right say this is what they why aren't you questioned them about why they think what they think now what they thought that\nWell gee why why don't you ask them if they want to open border\nIt's the same kind of positioning by the way I I Would do this during a debate of course the president's not going to be debating only went for a couple of years but I Would do this if I'm a candidate I Would do this on a debate stage\nWith my opponent if I'm a Republican candidate I Would be doing this with ah with with any of them I Would be I Would say you don't want to I went to the moderator I'll you'll my time if I could just ask ask my opponent what they believe the level of enforcement of the borders should be\nTelling me what level of enforcement do you believe in closing the borders altogether sealing the borders\nAnd only letting a limited number of people end that's basically what we have now I mean it's not sealed we have porous borders but do you believe we should enforce the borders or not because there is no half measure in my opinion\nThere is no half measure so either you believe in open borders or you lose enforced\nRight and it's about time after Thirteen Years Thirteen Years we can we talk about a McCain Kennedy when that went down to defeat Thirteen Years ago and the Republicans still have not been able to back the Democrats into the corner to make them feel so uncomfortable to challenge them to dare them to tell the American people\nDon't stop it do you have the potential over the next week I Know the early voting is happening but there's still a lot of votes to still be counted to make immigration illegal immigration the number one issue again yep\n[noise] for on the tracks here's your forecast\nIf you're not familiar with the term nor Easter it's what a good portion of the east coast calls a pretty significant storm with wins out of the north and east\nAnd that's what's moving up along the east coast today and steering those wins right into the shores of New York New Jersey on the Delmarva will see heavy rain and the region today from the Carolinas\nAll the way up through well at least Long Island and then back into the Appalachians as far as near Columbus ohio a good part of the country though is drive from\nAh I I don't know I I I I Want to make that if I go by I really don't like to spend a lot of time so I may go as one of the most scariest things that society knows\n... a conservative radio talk show host mhm\nI'm big enough I just show up like that and everybody's been caused him you didn't show up I certainly did conservative radio talk show hosts now the people that are holding it are conservative very conservative so I think that if I Do show up and they don't live far from me so I may show up just to do that right because I won't show up with anything I write yeah\nThe last time I think a ... for the was a cowboy which that is politically incorrect right\nNo you're in Texas\nWell this was in almost required well this was in New York this is Thirty years ago I were you wearing a\nGun um yeah I probably\nWill debate debate and on and that that still no that's not allow okay that was actually probably illegal [laughter] the fake gun they also that as a kid I can remember going out as would would be 'cause we wanted to make it simple mhm I don't remember ever getting\nHad probably ... I remember putting down to one of the plastic masks with the little string\nBut I I don't remember what the what are the only thing I remember wanting to be is again remember a hobo\nMhm you just take the stake in the little thing and you put them behind and yet ... put ... both charcoal on your face but right was it was is that politically incorrect you can't use charcoal while it was to make it was if you had like a beard right get like you had to be here like if I like uh like it was a five days growth as if\nYou know they shave every five days success exam on but now that's politically incorrect you can't go as as a no\nAid temporarily displaced or maybe permanently displaced Traveller\n[laughter]\nAway word or what about the the you know typically what I see at at my door on a on Halloween is is these days is superhero you know or the\nUh on Halloween is is these days is superhero\nYou know or the the you know the little girls will wear like a you know like a butterfly costume that's actually one of my granddaughters is going is she's got this really cool butterfly costume that she is going is about\nMy my grand sons going as a um a pumpkin his dad and I are trying to make it an evil pumpkin but his mom was fighting me on that\nSo you know she just wants a regular pumpkin one ... is a next Wednesday that or is it yeah\nYeah yeah well that I I've got to go to sleep all my lights nobody bought in my neighborhood you turn the lights off nobody bothers me I'd yeah that's about average that energy and and I was a code\nI mean I I Love every ... ... if ah the Halloween what once every uh four to four or five years and\nI'm On the friday and Saturday Night I stay home I Love it and I and I saw now some Taliban friday night because of leap year Colorado and wanting to run out she's that you write that blows that Sonia one mhm\nUh but I I Love it and I am I absolutely love I've got grandkids now so it's just this great the you know the kids and the kids on especially in the weekend they come to the doors mean they'll come until ten o'clock at night and and I just love it but I did see the stories where some towns are threatening to rest to teenagers did you see that who\nWho tricking treat or trick or treat like an age limit yeah be an age limit that's you can't do that sorry and and I'm thinking\nI I don't care if the older kids come to my dad did I I really don't care I mean I don't hear all of a sudden you'll you open the door especially like at nine nine thirty a little bit later it's a bunch of high school kids\nYeah I think that's fantastic yeah my neighbor Bob came over he's eighty six I gave him [laughter]\nHe was dressed and I'm an old man\n... ... every year it's like the neighbors get to get hired who's running out of candy and he got it all I got to bail out while I ever running out of candy I I I get but I mean I always buy weights while I don't even end up closing the door I end up sitting out on the porch and the neighbors come over and it's just a great time and I don't carry me you'll have you'll you'll have\nAnd the high school kids come out a little bit later and\nAnd but everybody is done by nine thirty ten\nWe um we we we kind of have a it depends on you know again if it's a weekend or not my granddaughter's\nOr we'll go to you know we'll go to their house and walk with them in the neighborhood sometimes I it just depends on what they're doing\nYou know they're getting older now my oldest granddaughter is Thirteen so you know I'm I'm not even sure she's going to want to go trick or treating I have no idea they love dressing up though I mean they're they have a lot of fun doing it well it but but then we come home and then you know it's it's like whatever time it is if it's not too late\nAnd then we hand out candy so it changes when you have grandkids\nWell you know it's like when when are we we talked about this before when well you know seven or eight year olds and defining their sexuality and we're like excuse me when I was eight years old the only thing I cared about was candy I did hear the Seinfeld that on candy just a couple of weeks ago again\nAnd that was my life my life revolved around candy ... and I didn't care about the Halloween costume\nRight would go out and even when we got to be ten eleven twelve Thirteen we'd go read co op too I we we we'd had Fifteen blocks I come home with grocery bags of candy and even at that age and all I cared about was the candy costume could care less yeah socializing could care less mhm get me the candy\nYeah right\nSo of course that's my that's that's my penance now we used to take a ... now is you know the high blood sugar I doubt to stay away from candy penance for being evil as\nWe would use pillow cases [laughter] and I know when we were poor because they were\nBigger [laughter] no they they were stronger yeah they could hold [laughter] that's right yeah I never ...\nI still do I ... in fact I don't have to do something like that I had a hello can build with candy it's much\nMuch better if that if ... if I didn't have that blood sugar sensitivity I'd be going out today I'd be going out yeah every Halloween and have a bag huge back I that pillow thing that's a good idea yeah\nIt's it's I remember one time when my son but it was right at the age where it was probably one of his last years so he was like twelve or Thirteen\nAnd he and his buddies ah had a couple of them are we went out you know together and then I went with them and they we we came back and we went inside because they were it was warm but it's really warm\nAs it often is on Halloween Night and they wanted to go and get something to drink and said yeah yeah yeah and so they set their pillow case was pillow cases down in the driveway we're only about halfway through\nAnd we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out\nAnd we came out and they were gone I mean we weren't in there really sixty seconds at the most we went in to get a bottle of water and we came out and they were gone\nAnd the boys were just so disappointed so it was my son and two buddies I said All right enough of the games they said what I went in I got king sized pillow cases\nAnd we didn't walk we drove I said we're taking a car we're going to hit every porch light that is on until you guys tell me\n[laughter] we build those pillow cases that night and it was one of the greatest nights ever\nThat's why we had a very much like minds didn't we yes well I I I was just you know of wondering now can you where is that is it okay to where Trump mask because remember the bottom masks are out there that the George W mass route during that\nTime well Iran resident there's a lot of them I mean you're probably still seeing Nixon mask yeah but I mean I have not seen a Trump mass you know with the one mask I I don't think I ever saw a Gerald Ford mask\nI don't think I ever saw one has ever Reagan mess you know that it was Reagan ... there was harder you know because of the big ...\nRemember that [laughter] I don't think there was a general\nMath such
