Y. twenty Eighteen the Treasury Department says with seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars that the hundred and Thirteen billion dollars more\nThan in the prior year but the Treasury Department here in emphasizing that Seventy billion dollars less than forecast in mid session review so they're saying that less than a we thought earlier this year\nOkay oh so it's a less that's good news right\nIt's less but it's the spending and that's the thing that's a big thing at the spending side of things we continue to go hey let's buy this will put it on credit cards with a high interest rates and we'll just keep doing that and then it doesn't matter\nBecause we'll pay it off later we'll pay it off later what we don't have that much to spend it's OK well financed it\nFor the government three point three trillion dollars outlay four point one trillion dollars and when you spend more than it taken so that's where he got the death of the seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars for twenty two\nYeah that is not good and and again the lip service sounds wonderful\nTo ask you about the national debt Twenty one trillion dollars of deficits seven hundred and Seventy nine billion dollars some anything that could reach a trillion two thousand and Nineteen months going on with that\nFor sure to serving an interest driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicare such Seventy percent of what was found over here from another don't have a thirty percent of what we're chef\nSo we overspend on those and\n... a lot of people take umbrage to the fact that he says what Social Security well we we pay into that was a Ponzi scheme it's a giant Ponzi scheme with no laws and it needs to be\nSorted out and I don't know what that is I don't know if we look at people in their thirties and say look this is what we're going to do\nI've always been open to privatizing some of doing some as we've gotta figure some stuff out and the way they were doing things is to try to grow the stakes to make it solve it to keep it there but then you've got all these other things out there and the fact it's everywhere Trump today took it took a run at it and I like the fact that he took a run at\nTrying to come up with some stuff\nOr having a cabinet meeting a little while and we're going to ask every secretary to cut five percent for next year\nYeah cut five percent who's up for that I'm raising my hand\nThat's a very very important request that are making everybody sitting around this table tremendous amounts of money and something that we can do and I I Believe we can actually do\nUsually yeah I think we could to but just because we can do it doesn't mean we will\nSo he's out there telling all of his people that I look here's the deal and this is the way I Would if we were if the private sector right to you and I have a company right we've got X Y Z which\nAnd business is good but the problem is to keep ourselves alive for a long time we overspend now we go to our group and we say look here's the deal we got some issues we're going to be fine if we do the right things and they we can fire\nA certain amount of people today or everybody can take a bit of a pay cut\nAnd we can level this thing out and when we get back to the point of where we should be\nWe can put that paid back out there\nSo we can sacrifice in one way or we could sacrifice in another way some soul I I I Love him he goes no he is he's just he's great he was saying that ah [noise] ah there are no solutions right in big problems there's only trade off\nWhat does the trade off now the tradeoff is we've got to figure out how to get this thing sorted out and I think one of these things is\nBig problems there's only trade off so what does the trade off now the tradeoff is we've got to figure out how to get this thing sorted out and I think one of these things is saying we've got to make some cuts we absolutely have to figure out how we're going to make some cuts because what we have right now isn't working\nAnd we've got to shop some of this stuff up get rid of the fat\nAnd heard of the ways\nAnd I'm sure you can do it I'm sure everybody has to say look at the [noise] they don't have a huge embed\nYeah it will be it'll have a huge impact but what's that going to be because even cutting five percent off certain things isn't going to get us where we need to be but then people go well what about those entitlements security and all of those kinds of things it's tough because nobody has to ... to go in\nAnd say something honestly about we need to sort this stuff out because the minute you do you become a target for all kinds of groups who once you've gone throwing grandma from the trainer off a cliff or making so many homeless all the things that they can do\nTo make you look bad so everybody just avoid it\nIn a bipartisan ...\n... that's how it all the treasures for

I'm going to go I'm powerful enough to be a player there and then you're retiring or you're only going there once but you can make enough noise to try to take something on that's the only way you have
