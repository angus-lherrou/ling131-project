[noise]\n\n\n... show [noise]\n[noise]\n\nHave you ever taken your car in for an oil change your mechanics mind something wrong and surprise you hit\nWith a huge repair bill and what happens when you're not covered by the manufacturers warranty your paying out of your own pocket to fix it that's why I recommend extended vehicle protection from cars you if your car has five thousand two hundred and fifty thousand miles car shield can save you from paying high\nThey bought our stuff it is a weird thing that goes on there remember this is and people say well we can't not do this we have to do this deal people are texting me and him saying no no no\nI think we looked at this I understand what Trump's trying to say he doesn't want to kill the steel because a lot of money pouring into us has a lot of jobs at a hundred billion dollars to people getting depending on and saying that this is a journalist\nWho had power and\nIf I'm Trump I look at this seriously really seriously what influence what was he working on what was happening that you would send potentially Sam Kean\nMen to take him out Fifteen and by the way from may\nReally wants to steal but I Will tell you this Congress has a say on this and a ... yeah they're not thrilled and if anything's going to unite them for all of the stuff that's happening at our country it may be this thing\nBecause I think it's important very right to know what happened [laughter] we've read the same clues everybody else towns obviously I'm probably some additional information which I kind of share we need to know what happened but ultimately I'm going to say this and I'm not saying this is what happened during the learning fun enough\nIf the Saudi Government ordered a guy to be abducted they killed them they chop them up the sound a bunch of people end up killing them drop 'em off and on my life so that's what happened [laughter] I'm telling you either the what's going to happen on Capitol Hill as a complete revolt against our policies with Saudi Arabia I\nThink about that and they could override this they could override this it's a very ... and again the relationship we have them look at nine eleven look at several of the other issues that have gone on well hobby is them all of these kinds of things is the you know a a it's one of those things where\n[noise] they hate it they hate Iran that that's huge they do their mortal enemies and that is a big issue\nSo we walk a weird fine line and that we have for for years the oil all of that stuff it is a very fine issue we walk but that a hundred and ten billion dollars in a lot of people were looking at\nWhat is taking place in this kind of\nBizarre weird fight revolution that is going on in in in what is trying to become a more modern Saudi Arabia\nWhere they were the younger king who was forward looking women may be able to get you know drive and yeah so they're getting license but there may be some more progressive things but then you've got a very hard line religious sect that doesn't want to move any any more forward than the sixth century that they're living in\nA so you've got all this weird things and this guy I mean this guy is a very\n... very interesting character like I said he he befriended\nOsama bin Laden and the eighties and into the early nineties and when he was fighting the Soviets and\nUh and and at times he was even trying to broker a deal of peace between Saudi Arabia and bin Laden he does about him after\nTwo thousand or one in nine eleven he just said he would would never have anything to do with him but he begged him to step away from all of this stuff this guy is that a lot of influence there and the influence he has\nIn giving people the opportunity to have a voice even if they don't say it's so much out loud to him and threw him was huge and now we're in a situation where\nYou know people are looking around going what what is going to happen with this what's gonna happen with this relationship with us in Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's unfortunate because they're unimportant partner and our Middle Eastern strategy to contain sort of a wrong the various influence in the region [noise]\nUh but but if they have gone as far as the lord of the sky and to the consulate kill them kind of a body offering them kind of career to do that on the left or they're responsible for and I'm not for an hour we're going to find out what the evidence was presented [laughter]\nBut that's what happened that I'm telling you what's going to happen here on Capitol Hill is an effort to completely fundamentally altered our relationship between the states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nYeah yeah that might actually happen and what did it take\nTook a journalist of all things Trump and the fighting and all this stuff Trump I think it's going to fight tooth and nail to try to keep the deal together talking about the influence talk about all these kinds of things that you know with this money what can you do and how do we need to keep them close\nBut I'm I'm On the opinion and they're going to go spend that money and it sucks the more you find out about this that around\nThe more you find out about this that originally I was like well we've got to see what this is all about but I mean I wouldn't want to give that up they're going to spend the money with Russia they going to spend that money with with China but the more you find out about this and and what it entails the more you're like you know what if they are a part of this can have it\nI just hope for ... sake for his fiance for about five what happened but I'm telling you of it is then there was going to be a complete and total revolt on Capitol Hill on both sides of the aisle about our relationship with the Saudi Government so and it's an important relationship but I think but that cannot come we cannot allow allow about violence on in the face of something like this\nWithout without them center Marco Rubio thanks for calling\nYeah fantastic uh stuff for my career I there are three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter a it is it's weird and this whole thing again it's a very weird situation is going in and apparently is going to get a marriage license or or something like\nThat uh and he walks in on October seconds or to obtain a document he needed to get married his fiance was outside and he's never left\nShe reported missing when the constantly closes the Saudi Government said he left the conflict via the back\nInsurance the Turkish government said he was still inside and his fiance friends they know still missing and since then it is a it is it is [noise]\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and show is your Twitter what's changed
