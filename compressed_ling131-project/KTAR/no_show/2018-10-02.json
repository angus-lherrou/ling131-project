[noise]\n[noise]\nOn September ... Seventeen Seventeen Ninety seven the constitution was signed defining our government and guaranteeing our rights each September we celebrate constitution day and do the framers could never have

twenty three ... shows your Twitter you can tweet at us Brock Obama is out doing stuff not a shocker\nThe former president has now throwing his name behind two hundred and sixteen democratic candidates in federal and state races on the latest lift the ... democratic nominees for governor in states like Arizona Connecticut Florida and Michigan he's backing Christine hulk with the first openly transgender may already candidate for governor in Vermont\nAnd Tony Evers the superintendent of public instruction in Wisconsin is facing off against Governor Scott Walker\nIn a release the former president says he's focused on close races in which his support would make a meaningful difference\nI Love David Garcia he supports in ... they just never met Ninety nine percent of these people\nIf you can get out there and like the the big raised with Martha make Sally because Trump\nIs kind of come out to Arizona next couple of weeks you've got cinematic Sally you know they're going to try to do everything because this is one of those seats that they believe they can flip this is one of those seats they have a shot at flipping can we flipped this seat and it's really interesting when you see 'cause it looked the midterms\nFor a lot of people I saw a ban and over the weekend he was on the bill Maher which was a very interesting thing because bill are said hey look let's treat this guy\nKinda cool 'cause we just be nice and he comes out and he says you know what I I liked the fact\nThat you come on here because this is why the Democrats are losing because Republicans are willing to go into the lion's den and bad and said look I don't I don't do interviews with the bright bart's in the Fox is sort of stuff I Want to go in and actually\nLet's go into the you know into the teeth in line and let's go into line said let's talk about stuff and I liked that but he also said that this\nThis right here will be a referendum on Trump and this is the first chance where you can look and see what may or may not happen and you've also got to deal with the president\nA president's party almost always loses seats in the mid term elections there have been like two exceptions in the last Thirty years second apart his prospects are generally linked to the president's approval ratings currently Trump's average approval rating this past month or two points lower than Obama in two thousand ten when Democrats suffered a disastrous midterm\nInteresting very interesting and with this comes a potential here\nYou know with you know the whole thought process of hey could we started an impeachment and that is something that I think smarter Democrats who are more politically astute who aren't just riding on emotion want no part of I mean you're not you're not hearing that from\nThe PLO season the Schumer's and stuff because they understand what that does to a country they realize that but there are some serious issues here that the Republicans are going to have to deal with\nBut there are specific problems the strong for Republicans first\nSome for the Republican incumbents are leaving while only Eighteen Democrats have announced their retirement and it's just easier to flip an open seat second twenty five House Republicans aren't districts carried by Hillary Clinton two years ago mainly in suburban districts literally from coast to coast\nOnly Thirteen democratic seats are in Trump friendly district and it is here in suburban America where the president's approval ratings are particularly low\nYeah well that's understandable more rural America\nA and I I look I think I I I'm\nI Believe that they will lose the house but they will hold on to the Senate\nAnd it'll be narrow I Do I Believe I Believe there's going to be an issue that you know I think the Democrats feel like a it's all going this is going to be this is going to be a runaway thing we could feel the momentum building building but they've just got so much to defend and that right there is is the issue comparatively to the house\nSenate is completely different the map for two thousand and Eighteen is nothing less than a nightmare for the Democrats only one Republican seat is an estate Clinton Terry that's Nevada\nBut ten democratic incumbents are running in states that Trump carried five of them by landslides and in those states comes approval ratings are better than the national average right now Democratic senators are facing serious challenges in Florida Indiana Missouri North Dakota Montana\nMissouri North Dakota Montana yeah\nSo I I think the worry that the Senate is going to be lost I wouldn't be surprised when they picked up a tutor to that changes a lot of things are a member a lot of ... we're looking at the Senate here and the Senate is\nWe're Kavanaugh it's ...\nI think a lot of people were worried that they were going to lose potentially\nThe Senate and the house and the impeachment may start but the reality of the whole thing is is that they're able to hold on to things that will be huge just in case they do end up blowing out cabinet gives them an opportunity to come back with somebody else Amy Coney Barrett or whoever they choose which would you know give Trump again another opportunity if they're able to pick up\nSome seats\nThen that would give them some breathing room which I think they would love to have like any party would love to have\nYou ever it's in the red states where the Kavanaugh nomination may play out particularly are influential ally remember only senators and congressmen not house members vote on confirmation the feeling was that these red state Democrats might be pushed to vote for confirming having all the recent allegations\nOf may make that differently also in these states centrist Democrats are going to be pushed by their Republican opponents on immigration on whether they embrace the policies of the more progressive left wing of the national Democratic Party yeah\nAnd why is that important well because\nOnce this is over\nPeople start throwing their hats in the ring and over the weekend Elizabeth Warren time [laughter]\n\nWhen I go to Washington and fix our broken government and that and a woman at the top\n[laughter]\nAfter November I Will take a hard look\nAt running for president [laughter]\nShe's going to wait until after November sixth because she realizes if\nThey don't get what they think they're going to get this blues tsunami that maybe just maybe people are ready for the the Gruber progressive side of things I still think that she's going through a rat in the ring I still think that but I also think she realizes do if if if if they aren't served\nMeaning ... by that I mean you know like hey you got served the Republicans and they're able to hold potentially some some more of the house and they thought they were and definitely maybe pick up a seat or two in the Senate and then the reality is is\nShe got to think or is this what people want right 'cause it's okay to whomever aggressive in New York and LA in Chicago and San Francisco in Seattle but it doesn't work elsewhere\nRight in Massachusetts it's okay to be ... progress but is middle America ready for that and this populism an advantage\nOver the weekend said it and look the populism of the the socialist movement if you will they let me take care of you movement let me do all of these things movement is growing and I wouldn't be surprised if we have the populist moving to Trump versus the populist movement of somebody like a Bernie Sanders\nOr Elizabeth Warren and those will be our choices in a couple of years very interesting\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet us ... somebody an friended me 'cause I did a video earlier\nUh doing lots of videos because Chad messages on TV and and all over you know the YouTube's into everywhere are about the sick and tired of the white nest and the guy in front of
