I think she said she couldn't remember what year it ... if I stay cold right\nNow she got there actually I don't get that\nCold a ... a little ... all over the last ... last away\nWho are for the yeah you you would have you had that you and we'll have to weigh located lawyer would act like\nYou would have to ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats right as I as I said very easily\nThat's why she's not ... that that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless there were people to bakar up when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement this isn't a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it\nWhere I don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know what she did it but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that\nYou give give contradicting testimony that you gave its not credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't uh somebody's asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer it just moves on it's like okay give me an answer\nYou want to look something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it\nRight because it's very important that there's an expectation yep\nHuh remember\nWho ... who who was it who asked to Obama the follow up question where was that was that oh that was here in ah in those ... wasn't oh no yeah yeah yeah well of course would be separate ... okay uh one where you have a local reporter here\nAh from WFAN ATV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be father worked\nQuite right that that is that if you asked a question did make sense to be a follow up question right that that there was actually an and this is something that has to stop this ... this kind of buzz sorrow world respect\nThat we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again right and then I'm going to come down right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre real world versus fact that a journalist is supposed to give\nA\nPolitician who won't answer a question on an issue that is the reason that you brought them on the air with you mhm don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show have the guts to answer my question but if you're gonna be got let's go way\nI feel like I'm Talking to somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're yelling at all of them and and [laughter] you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well Stephanopoulos and everybody else allow them to get away with it\n\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the questions nope no I don't\nAnd what would they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question ... well\nAnd that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just stayed it we're going to help this person to build a narrative here so let's talk to them let's help them build their own narrative\nYeah we'll forget journalism right oh\nSorry then my question is the one I should be asking\nAnd I should be asking oh my focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the\nEasy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I Would have said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nLike\nYour your your\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did like this\nYou can respond to that statement if you'd like to yes or no true or false\n[laughter]\nBut this is why people right at ... at least frustrate the daylight Saddam ... this is why people hate it no but you're going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they were on they knew they were going to face tough questions\nOr remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that you become black balled yeah they won't come on your show any more because you demand that they\nThat they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah when you come in with look when you're a U.S senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House\nWhen you go on a show you know while you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this and so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my staff around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that's what is CNN they all know what's gonna happen mhm they all know they're going to do that\nWhen it's somebody gonna finally say a you're not answering my question would you answer the question and at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the manger personalities on the major political personalities who run and dry this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no its face the other way [laughter]\nMeet the press that was probably the main we're going to do a handshake that's the way it's going to we were just going to go out there and pat each other on the back unless you're a Republican\nAnd this week is weak this ... ... there [noise]\n[noise] [laughter]\n[laughter] your mom [laughter]\n\n\nI might as well be giving that answer to every question here mom [laughter] what do you think that your mom\n[laughter] [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] ... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it why not just make it I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of\nGrade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble the words actually you got to make up a word nothing can be a real war word and you've got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board\nAnd as long as you used to send us more [laughter] okay [laughter] so that's why I Would just make it a game [laughter] because that's all it is exactly nobody's taking a the their constituents are seriously in the case of a Jeff Flake he didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer it\nI don't know I don't know who would yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an old man [laughter] ah\nBecause various or not or a very observant yeah yes and it's not Democrats you might think Mr Coons and all of you may think that Jeff Flake is a hero\nI'll say what I said earlier friday is a long ways away Trump just got back into the game that can often be very dangerous for Democrats\nEight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nWas bug

it's something uplifting\nUm I I thought it was really interesting the last weekend amidst all the other things that are going on in our country and even in the world that uh it was Tiger Woods that were there a unifying factor last weekend\nOr people around the world watched him win his first PGA golf championship and five years um and just sixteen months ago Jim I I don't think you'd be hard pressed to find anybody who thought that he work or play golf again never mind when\nI include possibly Tiger Woods on that list I'm not sure what he would have thought sixteen months ago\nWell he said he confided to\nAnd he confided to a trusted friend about sixteen months ago that he was done a word that he used a private or to describe himself in his situation and I think I think what's so what is so inspiring and what's brought so many people together around him is that\nMe jarred the era the electric vehicle has a rise in celebration electric cars are more fun to drive and more

break\nFrom the intense a\nCabinet media do with your words will be returning\nNext hour in for night after night after night to come but this just struck me as a great story and those are the book out of the time it came out of course we're thinking well\nA great story is just going to be sort of like the uh the the obituary of his career and then the way I'm In a a wonderful tournaments victory but it's interesting to note to jump in there that he had shown some rumblings before this there were signs that may be finally\nAfter all those surgeries and all the coaches and all the swings and all the clubs\nThat finally tiger headed back together\nAnd there's no question I mean if you if you we wrote the last chapter this book in January of this year and at the same month that we were writing the final chapter\nHe made his first appearance back on the PGA Tour after its court back surgery and a long long absence from competitive golf and um you know he he looked like a player who hadn't played in a long time but the fact he was\nHe was out there and if you watched or the trajectory of his performance from January through this summer\nHe got consistently better and better and better and by the time the British Open came around where they hold to play on the final day he was in the lead and at the PGA tournaments he finished two strokes behind or two shots behind the winter I mean you could see that he was on the cost of something great\nIt was just a question of when and uh last weekend when it happened I think\nThat that scene with you know what amounted to thousands of fans really stamped Keating onto the Eighteenth fair way\nIt was it was almost identical to what happened back in Nineteen Ninety seven when he was especially a rookie on the tour\nAnd he won the western open a cog ill and and there was this massive is you know sea of people that stormed out of the fair way with him it look like a scene out of a Hollywood movie and when we saw that repeated last weekend to me part of the reason that that's happening down is because\nThis is a guy who we've seen go through everything from an infidelity scandal to a very public and humiliating divorced two\nDebilitating injury is two addictions to pain pills all of this played out in ways that no one would would ever want to have played out if if it was you\nAnd I think the fact that we've watched him go through so many of these things and yet still come back and fight through and he's corrected all those things if you look at him now he's a he's a forty two year old man who's been through a tremendous amount\nAnd I just think people want to see him six feet and uh people are rooting for him in ways that that really do transcend sport\nI mean you're right he's forty two or he is in fact the old enough to be the father of bad kid we just talked about a moment\nYou know a father a bad kid we just talked about a moment ago I was building some of the staff from the last weekend's a play and uh\nUh he he no longer holds long drive me still drives far but he's certainly not the king of that anymore how else says his game change from the the tiger who came on so strong as a as a kid\nWell it's changed a lot of ways I mean when he came on the scene really in the in the fall of Nineteen Ninety six um he was driving the ball with more distance and power and frankly Adam more violent swaying than anyone had ever seen in the history of golf\nUm he was like a a comic\nWho who came into the tour and he was instantly dominant I mean that's the thing that was so stunning to everybody was\nHe actually lived up to the high or he won the masters in Nineteen Ninety seven by so much distance that people are thinking I mean if this is the future if this kid who essentially left Stanford after a sophomore year can win the ... the masters by that much distance\nWhat is it going to be like to play against this guy for the next Twenty years and in fact what we saw was a guy who was so good who who was the dominant\nThat he really would beat people often times before they actually competed he he was\nThat much mentally tougher and better what we see now is in ... as a guy who who is much older\nOr we've had nine surgeries including for on his back who's who's gone through probably more injuries and come back for more injuries than most professional football players\nAnd he had to significantly modify his swaying um he's now in an old an elder statesmen on the tour and yet he still I'm now in the top twenty of world ranked golfers and that I just think that's going to stay or go up from where he is\nHe's he's um we describe him in the book as a genius and that's a term that we don't use lightly and it's not one that I've ever applied to any other athlete I've written about and I've been writing about athletes are over Twenty years but tigers\nDifferent he he's he is genius he's a prodigy\nChild who became a genius who does things with a golf club that have never been done before and we'll probably never be down again\nHe has been too of course so many coaches so many swings and the like a powders or the like it and it always struck me again as a casual observer only of of the road gone but it always struck me if it ain't broke don't fix it was it really necessary to go through all of those changes he made\nWell he he has changed his swing I mean depending on how you define that and count at\nLeast five times in his career and in the early parts of his career he was changing his swing and I mean ... when he was at the top of the world of golf\nAnd I think that that when I when I mentioned he's a genius arm and I you know call him that is because if you think about it that would be a ten to someone like Michael Jordan\nI'm deciding while he was the best player in the world to only shoot left handed I mean it it it's like ... retraining yourself to do something that's counter to what you've been doing to become the best in the game and I think that\nWhat it says about tiger the ability to be the number one golfer and change your swing like overall it it's like remodeling your house I mean\nHe started over and when he would do that you know it would look like he was in a bit of a slump he will neither at a slump this was him you know remodeling a swing and and as he did so once he got it\nHe was right back to the dominant golfer that he was before a overhaul the swing of the fact that he's done that periodically at different points in his career I just think speaks to how much how much different have different IEDs and everybody else\nWanted six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five four six to six were coming come back and to talk some more with a special features writer for Sports

press coverage a when tiger was younger\nUm and and rightly so but that coverage and never got to what are all was really about and I think uh we we tried to go as deep as we could but basically he is\nHe's a central figure in tiger's wife and if you look at his upbringing or and the way that oil and coal pita tigers mom\nI'm who got even less coverage um and who have in our mind and equally a sizable role and tigers are bringing the way they raised him he was an only child um [noise] their only child or had been previously married you have three children from the first marriage\nUm he did not want to have more kids when he married for the second time ah but ... his wife did she was a Buddhist she wanted to have children they had one uh they gave him\nA very unusual name or when he was

and just had five started and it was garbled and you knew that that would say that's not really true anymore they're not people hired you just write reviews and they're getting very good at it [noise]\nUm there was a survey that found that about eight and ten people say that they read a sacred view in the past year I'm In eighty four percent of them and say hey I don't even know if I can always spot fake review so I just thought you know this is an opportunity to really dig into what is a research showing what experts say\nAbout um spotting fake reviews for the first one which I Am not try and realize but I'm examined the timing of her views if you see a lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time that can be a sign that those are fake reviews\nUm that's because there's a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch of new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if there is a product launch and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the
