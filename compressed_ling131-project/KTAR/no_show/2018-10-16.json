Saudis alike look here's the deal\nWe killed him but there's caviar when me do it was like oh no no\nNo we went too far but like we we didn't know we weren't supposed\nTo go that far and it was more guys that were like these guys are new bees and they weren't really like they didn't quite understand\nAnd and they just went to like now it's up to Trump to figure out what what the deal is\nWe're working with Saudi Arabia for and they were trying to figure out what happened and they want to know what happened also a lot of people are working on it\nNow the question is pretty simple what do you do if you're Trump\nLike if you're Trump right now what do you do because people are going to be looking at you at this moment of time and saying All right now do you value what human beings like and there's a difference between a human being and a person of power I Know it sounds horrible they're all\nPeople but this person had an influence like you and I don't have enough in a place in in the world that at times ah needs a voice and needs influence\nAnd seeing the kind of be above the fray and it was\nIs very interesting so what do you do if you're Trump right if you're Trump the question is going to be by a lot of people because you're seeing tons of actors I said this today to to somebody\nIt feels a lot like this is apartheid in South Africa you're seeing businesses you're seeing all kinds of of celebrities and people including the W W E which apparently a a poll out today\nOf what was supposed to be their second big thing in in ah\nIn Saudi Arabia you are seeing a lot of of people take notice because this right here\nHas huge ramifications don't want a guy who is so influential in a part of the world where people don't have a voice and he in many ways was their voice over two million Twitter followers in a part of the world where there's probably only two million Twitter followers because of\nThe freedoms that they lack in the opportunities that lack and this guy kind of was that guy and now they take a step back and they're looking around and this doesn't make them look good at all so if you're Trump's you have to ask yourself the question what do I do\nAnd it's tough\nIt's tough you don't want to lose all those you know billions of dollars that are floating into American companies you don't want to lose the potential growth in businesses and or people keeping their jobs but you do need to send a message and what does that message going to be and is that going to be enough for everybody and how's the rest of the west and the free world going to

lot of boxes and while conservatives may not like his personality they look at the boxers you checked off and they're like yeah I like that those things are good I like those things I Will tell you that\nBecause I don't want you to think that I'm I'm a hate mongering anything else that you can throw out there on Trump\nBut I like the things that he said he was going to do and he's done them and the reality is that she is really starting to press the issue she said about three four weeks ago she was not ruling out looking into it and now two thousand twenty and doing something like this shows me that she's more than just serious she's ready to take that next step\nAnd bring her brand of politics to America\nI also that he is rather not say that all he'll destroy the thought that that is well I\nKnow and there you go start to build up the your going to turn our country in the Venezuelan start to build that up that process if she's going to turn this into Venezuela here she goes she's turning us into Venezuela it's comic she's turning us into Venezuela\nAnd as we all know Venezuela is not good when they talk about socialism and the funny thing when they talk about social is\nRight when they talk about socialism and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders brand of politics they never want to bring up Venezuela that's the thing they never want to bring up they never they don't want to talk about that because it's not pretty it's pretty it all the exact\nOpposite of pretty right it's the exact opposite of ready they can talk about all they want but the reality is socialism never worked\nIts Scandinavians not socialist way socialism ever worked nowhere\nWhy would you say to the American that's like the idea of socialism and supported here\nI Would say that they should wake up and you don't need the government to dictate how your how to live your life or how much money you should make how your family should be a treat it or how much he should pay\nThey come out that the next time you hear Michael Moore celebrities praising socialism socialism rex economy wrecked lives [noise]\nAnd this and it kills\nYes it does it's ugly and it's never work and they can talk about all they want and that's why Trump is laughing he wants to take her on\nHe wants to take her on he's begging for Bernie he's begging for her because those independents out there who sit around and say to themselves\nAnd not a huge fan of Trump but you know what I'm not a fan of that socialism\nAnd they're speaking that giving more power to government giving more things to government handing over more of our life the government that's not what I Want I may not like\nWho he is as a person but I can get over that what I don't want is I like you as a person I think you're it OK person but the reality is you're going to destroy my life so I'll step away from the three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and shows your Twitter you can tweet at us\nFor all the talk of we're going to get into recession we're going to have these things this is going to happen I'm like you guys know that's how bad a recession will be I don't know but I Will tell you one thing\nWhat's coming in the future that isn't being talked about needs to be talked about you know twenty thirty forty years ago you come out of college you have very little if any debt whatsoever\nYou could start to get on with your life you could start making money and you could take that earnings that you had because of that college degree and you could put that back into the economy we live in a different world now kids are coming out with hundreds of thousands upon thousands of dollars\nOf massive debt that is turning into hundreds of thousands of potentially millions of dollars in debt over years\nAnd instead of putting that money back into the economy like buying homes and things that come with homes what they're going to be doing is essentially trying to survive and that\nIs going to put a huge dent in our future economy\nOn student loan debt I'm I think it's important that people will be able to borrow to make what maybe the most important investment\nTheir lives which is in their education or so overall I think are willing to invest in yourself is this something we should we should foster subject to a couple of important copy us first\nIt's very important that people understand the nature of the nature of the borrowing and the risk that they're taking in and the and the possible payoffs and that sort of thing so that they make informed decisions\nInformed decisions are huge and there's a reason that they need to make informed decisions because\nI've got friends who graduated college twenty plus years ago\nThey're still paying off their debts\nAnd their debts are nothing compared to their kids debts and their assumed to be kids get to I mean these debts are massive\nAnd when you have the government stepping in saying we're going to guarantee all these loans you can't get rid of these laws all of a sudden you are making a house payment\nRight for your education\nWhich is going to strike it's going to put a huge dent in what we're doing as we try to grow\nOur economy your kids coming out with three hundred thousand dollars in debt\nAnd they're looking around and they're getting a job and they're making a thousand dollar month payment or eight hundred dollars a month payment on some of these things and they're gonna be paying these things off for years and years and years and money that should go into the economy because that they would become a a productive member of society it's going to be tough\nBecause that's going into education and when you get the government involved the way it is the kind of money that they're guaranteeing these kids they're taking it out willy nilly and on top of that they're taking out other debt to be able to live while they're trying to go through school and it is going to eventually explode\nThe second thing is um I think alone among all kinds of dead or we don't allow student loan debt to be discharged you run into young I'd be at a loss to\nTo explain why that should be the case so it's something and this is fiscal policy that says something for you and not something for the fed but we do see is in federal search shows and other research shows you do start to see\nLonger term negative effects on people who can't pay off their student loans that hurts their credit rating ... impacts the entire half of their economic life\nAnd that's something to think about what you may have a lost generation or two of people who are going to be able to afford to live the way that their parents lived at even a fraction of the ways that their parents live until their parents eventually pass away and leave them stuff\nTo get themselves out from underneath this giant enormous burden of debt now granted they took it on themselves\nBut do you think about it\nIf an Eighteen year old comes due today and says give me a hundred and fifty thousand dollar loan you're going to be like\nShut up never going to happen\nIf an Eighteen year old comes you did say I need a hundred fifty thousand a little 'cause I Want to go to school in a basket weaving liberal arts degree from some college that's going to I'm going to come out with a degree after four or five years on top of that extra debt that I was you know taking credit cards to pay for these kinds of things of life that I wanted to lead\nJust to survive you're going to be like oh that's fine but what it does long term and when you think Mike Rowe right now it doesn't affect them at think macro\nSo that's the that's the public policy argument for us to do something about student loan debt and the and the way we structure a higher education financing my question for you is do you see this as a macroeconomic risk\nIt will over time it's not something you can pick up in the date of right now but as this goes on and a student loan continues to grow and becomes larger and larger than it absolutely could hold that gross\nYeah and I think it's going to and I think for all the talk of the new housing bubble that's coming and a lot of these other things over a trillion dollars in debt the kids and and young adults and even older adults boomers have a ton of it\nBut it's still sitting out there that is not going to be able to be discharged nor should it be because why would you let somebody do that but the fact that you're willing to go out and say you know what I Need this degree so bad\nThat I'm willing to spend three hundred thousand dollars and even if it's a hundred thousand dollar loan think about how long it's going to take you to pay that off\nHeat is massive and what it's going to do for us in the future I don't think we're talking enough about it but it's coming it is three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you\nA
