well at least enjoying\nEverything everything's up to somebody and so that becomes a fear on this who's training to a guy and who's trading the think something's offensive\nSo what you're getting another one of those giant technical glamorous being able to control speech and that's\nWhenever anytime that happens that's a bad thing\nBecause you just want people will be able to be a jerk if they want to be a jerk or be nice if they want to be not\nAs ... you know it's just that we got enough issues with tech right now in Silicon valley running the world and and and the craziness of that and trust me I I deal with it on a daily basis basis trying to do stuff that Facebook hacking thing like I don't think a lot of people understood how big that was\nOne of the reasons they didn't is it's being reported that Facebook was purposely not allowing those stories into its own a feet\nSo stories about they were being hacked was being blocked as spam by baseball\nSo that was interesting to me I like there's an example of when a giant corporation can't control a message\n[laughter] this is the message this was bad for them and they're you know their algorithms are saying oh yeah we should allow that through\nThat spans what weapons fan that happens\nLike you're not fooling anybody off the establishment media it's not real real talkative Paula Mona or a tech guru we moved from there to this is what I find interesting we're going to get as we know more and more about the brain we're going to get to the point where we can\nReally understand it and eventually you know I say we're going to be downloading all kinds of stuff and you may live forever may not be in the body or in right now maybe an other bodies are inside of a computer and all of this stuff\nBut as far as like violent people shocking the brand 'cause we've always tried stuff from the bottom even tried shocking stuff we try to potentially shocking the brain could make you less violent\nSo a new study where they've they've brought a bunch of violent offenders mostly you know physical violence back and I think sexual assault type of vendors and they struck their brains and they asked them on a scale from one to ten how likely are you to\nWant to do this again how I Want to you know get physically violent and it was really resting forty seven to Seventy percent of people reduced their what their what are their desire\nTo express in a violent manner they were able by this bird sucked in the brain it was giving them the ability it seems to readjust their thought process and re channeled the anger in a way that wasn't a violent aggressive act that would be physically attacking stuff one yes as a minute treatment\nYet whether this is a small study I also look at it in in how we gonna do this in in the future when it comes to things like people with post traumatic stress disorder or memories where maybe we can block it or shock it out of you as if it doesn't happen and there's a worry that\nIf you do that you may change the person that you are today but is it better doing that than living with the thing that has happened in your life\nWell it's true and sometimes maybe you want to change the person you are today\nYou are becoming a super depressed person or a super problematic person you're not be able to to really cope with life they have seen when it comes to depression potentially twenty plus percent improvement using a electric magnetic electromagnetic stimulation of the brain\nOn depression patients so if it helps with that and that's something you know you don't want to be a depressed person and we society don't want violet people running around\nSo if you're in prison\nSo if you're in prison could this be somehow\nInstituted were prisoners that are violets get this as part of their therapy before they're released from prison\nArea and it's not a base of it's not like doing not unlike doing you know the bottom ease not you know and it's not you know something that would be invasive to pace and it's like ... year for twenty minutes in this contraption that goes on your head and we will treat you for your violent behavior\nAbsolutely you know what think outside the box talking to ... ah and find the last ... for all of those you out there who is super excited about the fight from Fifteen or people at the fast food restaurants and we saw yesterday that a lot of us read the fast food on a daily basis and it's become a way of life here in America\nAnd guess what the burger people who are serving you may be leaving the touch screens are coming but there is a bad thing because what do we do ball\nWe buy more and that's the desk health for uh the the regular human service\nThey realized the McDonalds and put all these touch screens and a bunch of their stores and they're talking about putting at least a thousand touch screens or a thousand stores will be adding touched brings to him every year or they're trying to make getting faster than a year and the reason why is\nIt is fun they realized people find it fun and because it's fun they order more\nSo once they hit that big corporations bottom line\nBurger King or Wendy's everybody's going to say why don't we put testament than here if people are gonna have fries with it and have you know the super size to drink and order maybe you know a desert\nThe touch screen takes the place of everything that you can't really train a person at the counter to do which is up so your food items they try to but it never really apparently works as much as it does when you're in front of a computer screen it feels like a game almost what it is an of buying food\nIt's a game and it's a game that's when you're sitting there and and I've I've done it you know walk into some of the newer McDonalds and stuff and I look and there's a line for me because people for whatever reason to also knows there's also people are scared\nTo go into those thing yeah and it's the same thing when I go to a movie theater and there's a line and then there's two chaos that are just and like people are still this fear that that somehow that's not going to give you something to get inside the theater or your food's not going to impossible for that to for me to order there I got to go to this kid\n[laughter] and and and so you don't have to let go from the computer knew those that's the other thing so judgment do how many Big Mac [laughter]\nThat's the other thing it's like oh my God I can only three of these members I Walk out the feeder you're not you're not going to just make up here I mean as much as I Want [laughter] what's that mean like if you go or I'll take to double a quarter pound or if you're really really you don't really lately\nBut I noticed when I go into these places where I go to the movie theaters that people are afraid to use the touch screen like it's not real and I just go over not being bing bing bing bing bing bing bing and it is kind of fun 'cause I can do it myself no time I'm like you have you fired which I don't think it's nice either but I Do think that a lot\nBut it was it it kind of fun I have to admit it they've got his animations that come on screen and you're you're ... and also it's really easy to customize yes as you can tell I'm an effigy auto McDonald's ordering as [laughter]\nUsually so it was quite a lot I can have like extra onions and are no matinees or whatever just a few punches on my finger\nAnd I don't have to worry and check like you do with the drive through did they actually hear me and they actually get my order right that's right because yeah going you hit the hit some to the back of the ...\nThat is so generally don't like it my I grew up and right if I screw up its on me if I tell you something to screw up and I got a check all the time because I Know the chances are and the sounds horrible to say it for a lot of places around the country\nMaybe English isn't the first language and there's a there's a there's a barrier and a gap there and it's tough and oh goodness me you can just do plus you can customize and a lotta times there's things that you want and then you go up there and you're like if you're telling somebody\nYou just like okay this is how I really want it but I'll take this if you get half of this right I'm good you know that you get the whole thing right and it's easy and it's a game

investigation into the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh reads the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation\nSo there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential first hand knowledge\nOf the allegations we've heard from a the ... lawyer said well no she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had first hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right have you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against Kavanaugh\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark

wanted to do\nAll along delayed delayed delight with the outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president withdraw the nomination and that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got the the greater\nOr I guess the stronger a foot hold got by the president and of course the\nNominee himself this was a tactic by the left to delayed there's nothing more nothing

Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton you know wasn't the deity that Obama was\nBut\nStill in a situation like that back then that would have been done behind closed doors right if somebody on the left was like yeah listen uh you know we're trying to just\nDo this on our own uh you know you know maybe the the voters won't react positively to Bill Clinton being you know as a ... an endorsement on on the

let's not get political by bringing ESPN and right and I I mean it got huge news\nNo it was and and the endorsement list really I mean it came out and made his rounds but it really didn't go any further from that there hasn't been that presence you know by Obama and that might be his choice I mean they've been saying what they hanging out I did see the stories\nHere's what he's reading this

up the trailer we actually had um some glitches or which we we have no reason to\nTo believe or to know that it was connected to the project itself but it does get one looking over the shoulder I mean what's interesting is Robert ... who's this or a PHD was don't always peer reviewed studies I'm actually did research um which demonstrated how\nGoogle could swing an election uh well you know one direction or the other\nUh by shifting millions of votes spy controlling the information they got the Washington Post ran a story on\nThis and the next day he was blocked from Google\nThey actually could not access Google products at all I'm a similar thing happened to a doctor Jordan Peterson who we highlight in the film you say a\nPsychology professor at the University of Toronto uh\nHe was actually a blocked by Google a from accessing his Gmail accounts and his Google Calendar and his YouTube channel which you know has millions of people that have downloaded his content so it does happen to people or more often than you think and it just demonstrates the power\nThat this company has to decide if their whim\nOr how they are going to control what you see and what you have access to\nBut they don't play favorites [noise] well\nI mean that they claim right I mean I mean I I don't think that the example you just gave our our particularly noteworthy I mean there's sort of thing I I understand happens all the time and and and what the oil being that then I I I just don't see how they can with a straight face claimed that they don't do this\nYeah no that well that's exactly right and and one of the research studies that up Stein did that is particularly interesting we'd go through this in the in the film\nOr is during the twenty sixteen election uh you they actually enlisted volunteers around the country this was a a you know John ah blindly\nUm but they basically enlisted volunteers and had them conduct searches um on both\nGoogle and bang as it related to the twenty sixteen election this was over five six month period and then they captured all the search results that people got now some of these volunteers were in red states where some were blue states some of the Republican somewhere Democrats independents all kinds of genders you know all kinds of social\nEconomic status and what they found when they reviewed the result was that you know things seem to be pretty balanced but Google in every single search position of the top ten search results\nThis the results favored Hillary Clinton\nWhat they essentially did was they suppressed negative stories about Hillary Clinton and the feed and they pushed negative stories by Donald Trump\nIn the same search results um and you know by his estimate this had a somewhat dramatic effect on the election now it didn't help the results at the end of the day um but ... contention is that Google was essentially\nSettling with the books and what's interesting about this is that science essentially apolitical but he actually was a Hillary Clinton supporter in twenty six team a and what he is concerned about of course it's not the political implications of this in terms of who wins and who loses\nBut his real concern is do we really want to have a company having so much control over the flow of information that ran\nUndecided voters and you know there are a lot of undecided voters every election that when they start sort of going to the Google Search and saying which candidate should I vote for\nA and looking at the search results do we really want to have a company with the power to influence the outcome potentially of elections and that's what the real concern is here\nI think that's a pretty fair concern will take some calls for our guest Peter Schweitzer at the

are\nYou know which station is going to tell you the scores\nA totalitarianism it was all predicated on one thing Jim essentially the power of the state\nWas going to smash in control people\nSo you know in Nineteen eighty four it's big brother and you have these you know large television screens or these voices that are sort of pumping information to us but it was visible it's kind of the you know the the\nThe clenched fist right in front of your face you know what we're facing now is not any kind of police state\nBut what we are facing is this all this power that is trying to persuade us that is trying to steer us in a certain direction but we can't really see the fist\nBut it's still there and the power is still there and I think you're exactly right I mean imagine a ... imagine I'm ... now or a stolen or a Mussolini\nThat had this kind of control over the flow of information I mean we give them an enormous power and Google basically tells us trust us yeah trust us\nGeorge Orwell you had no idea how right you were to Linda in Champaign, Illinois hello Linda\nHow can I Am I going to make a quick comment a lot of uh the uh believe that the party has been building a Nazi techno state with still going on Facebook and all these people but what I really call let's say asking that want to thank our guests for what he's doing and about search engines\nAnd they're used to be I click which had\nA they they have another one called start paid for the same company that they got rid of ex click and that was if you didn't want to use silk will result he wanted other resolved and I don't understand that Google suppress did they make them ... ex quicker what happened to it and I have that that uh\nYeah no that's a great question I mean this is this is fascinating when you look at at at how Google operates in this space so look at apple for example apple has the search engine called safari\nBut safari is actually run by Google Search algorithm and you know why because Google pays apple nine billion dollars a year for the opportunity to run safari searches to think about that\nIt's an apple product and Google is actually theoretically doing apple a favor\nBy doing their searches but it's actually Google that's paying apple and why is that because they want the information and the data that comes from search results because they can monetize it and sell it to other people and this is what Google is doing\nEverywhere and you're exactly right start page a is a a search engine you get great results\nThey actually use that get Google algorithm they have an agreement with Google that allows them to allow the search is to go without data being president I think that is that is going to change eventual Eby to start pages becoming more popular it was a deal struck awhile ago duct duct go is good\nIt's it's not as good as Google and that's part of the challenge part of the challenges the best search engine out there in terms of results ineffectiveness is
