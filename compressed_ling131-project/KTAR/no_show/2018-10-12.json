the guy who was an outspoken civil rights leader of the time and he had his issues as well\nUh Jim Brown the great football player but first of all I kept calling ... a ... a ... but\nHe uh he said like I don't think anybody should Neal we're a family and we need to figure things out because they talked about yes\nA policing all kinds of thing it was all over the place that at times it was surreal Kanye was holding court and it was interesting but he says and and people always say why is the right obsessed with Kanye and there are so happy for him and I said it's not the fact that he likes the president doesn't like the president because I don't think he agrees everything\nWith the president I really don't know the fact is is he's got a platform he like some of the stuff their egos match each other right there ... both married to a powerful women and and and they may they get each other right like they get each other but\nIt's the fact that he doesn't go in step into with the left\nThat he's willing to go for I really don't care I'm doing my own thing\nRight I'm doing my own thing but something ... and and and I said this to to a couple of ... to me it's like why are you guys are obsessed and I said it's because you cheered him when he said George Bush hates black people write you cheered him but now when he's not on that same kind of path you're pissed off and angry\nRight he then he was a genius now he's insane so that's what you're going to do but he said something that and I said even if he's insane guys just want to understand this\nJust because he may have some screws loose and he was kind of all over the place today doesn't mean that some of the stuff he's not saying doesn't have valid points\nWhen I Saturday Night live to prove all the liberals are prove on it if you don't look good we don't look good this is\nTrump told the truth is these right on the line and that is true some I've been saying something\nI've been saying over and over and over and over and over again don't want to see the other side's fail\nIs ridiculous\nIt is absolutely ridiculous to want to see the other side fall apart\n\nBecause that's the way you feel you can get power is ridiculous the hope that the president fails to Bill Maher saying I Hope we have a recession the people cheering fourteen hundred points coming off the Dow in two days because they're hoping this happens is insane that's that is for that is not patriotic is at all\n... not\nIt's it's it's a sad sad thing but he was all over the place he was a the ... thing was just just crazy they talked about all kinds of stuff uh you know and and ... to me it was it was again it was surreal moment in the White House\nWell we make everything that China and not an America that were cheating on our country and we're putting people in physicians\nThat has to do a legal thing she factory out the president's [laughter] yeah\nBut I mean it's different I mean he he said a lot of stuff that I think it was a bit out there like that's one of one of the reasons that people make stuff cheap everywhere and Trump even fact checked him on Foxconn and a few other things but some of the reasons that people do the things that they do like go elsewhere is because we hear demand cheap goods\nBut I understand what he was trying to do and I think he said some stuff today that was real and and just because you don't like him because he's not on your team anymore as far as what goes because he's wearing a make America great again hat just because of that doesn't mean that all the things that he thinks should be discounted because a lot of times\nIt's true right\nBut he had to go off on some wacky tangents he did he did he absolutely did he went off in some crazy stuff and you're just like he said he's bipolar but not bipolar is a genius you tested the Ninety have said dial he was all over the place to be showing Trump stuff on phones because apparently wants to design cars I don't know it is what it is but it was a surreal moment in the White House today\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter\nYou can tweet us\nYour black and you're a baby sitter what

start figuring this out and saying that the hundred and ten billion dollars that's that's a lot of money can be coming to the United states and they're going to spend it and there may spend it with somebody else and know those those people\nAre going to get the money China or Russia and what are they going to do it\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three actually I've been to chose your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you\nSo a very interesting\nThe the whole question of the day is one of third parties you know when I saw what did I you know you've got Kanye in there and he's doing his Kanye stuff 'cause that's what ... does and it was interesting he was holding court\nUh but my question is you know why can't we talk to one of the civility gone and we're going to dig deeper into a little bit later but we need a solid\n\nThird party and here's the thing that I talked about before when it comes to authorities we don't need a third party that's equal you can make a lot of noise\n\nBeing strong and small meaning if you took twenty seats thirty seats in the house maybe five or six seats in the Senate right you take anywhere between you know you've got in ten to Fifteen Percent you can do a lot of things\nYou can\nYou can do a lot of things and I think we need a real party and I'm Talking about the Green Party right with Jill Stein I'm not talking about Gary Johnson because God\nThat he just it was awful 'cause we just admitted right like can we right I'm not talking about ... insane although everyday film last and he's like he's not just wants to talk about it going and that's why he's running for president block jade and said\nTalking about what I'm Talking about somebody in a party that is real but I think could it you know can see all sides and is there more for the most of the times I think the referee and the random in\nThe mature party will call [laughter]\n[noise] what do you think though would you be open they could you be open to a third party\nThat's not insane that's not crazy about a real party fifty percent of use of force that yes I can four percent say no forty six percent says depend on the politics and I think the politics would be very much an independent minded look at things and so let's just say let's let's break this down how this would work\nSo you've got a party that is somewhat in power right the has the most ... just you're right but you've got a party that's got then you've got another party yeah so the Republicans Democrats one of those who's going to have the most seats the second seats is going to be the other one this is the third\nIs the one that's going to be swayed because you know those two can't stand each other and the right now it's worse than ever before so it ends up happening is they're going to have to come to you to get stuff done\nAnd if you're able to say look I understand what you're doing there and I agree with this this and this but you know what if you want to vote you got to get rid of this you got to get rid of this you got to get rid of this because I see it from their side too so it is a way to move things through and that might be the best way to break the gridlock\n\nIn many ways just like being an independent who do both sides cater to come election time who was the vote\nThey need the independence because they're the ones that are going to sweat 'cause we're so driven and separated right now they got to come and they gotta go okay okay okay ... we need your vote what do we have to do\nI think in a bigger way if we can do something like this I think it would change the law three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned show is your Twitter babysitting while black\nI'm babysitting right after I got I got to give an American woman or maybe the lady across the street with somewhere warmer than reading over here to follow on me because I got to\nI've got two kids and the vaccine that does have this way\nSo that guy right there cordless his name and he is babysitting and it doesn't mentoring program and and you know he looks to be in his mid twenties early thirties kind of thing and he's got like a eight and ten year old\nBoy and girl in the back and they happened to be white and he happens to be black and there's a woman who was worried that these two kids have been taken away snatched from their parents because stranger danger is everywhere\nThis lady said it upon herself to say that she's going to take my place now call the police\nThe twenty eighth the and this is what I got to do it I Can't go out with two kids that look like me and without something weird to see the way the accent I'm moving she's harassing me because I have two kids that do not look like [noise]\nYeah\nSo she's following them and it's a very weird situation okay first of all it takes them the subway and then he takes it to Walmart if you're going to\nKidnap somebody right like let's just say I've seen enough kidnapping shows to know that you're probably not going to take um outdoors\nRight like they usually put them in a room where he can't scream and they've got the room sound proved those kinds of things like if you're going to do that\nThat you're not like hey before we get to this part where I totally kidnap you and take you and how'd you forever why don't we go get a sub sandwich we'll talk about which kidnappings they'd be like maybe go to Wal Mart we can get you some stuff to kind of just chill time you know you're probably not going to do that now we live in a world of see something say something I get that but here's my thing\nWith this if it's a white guy with two black or Asian kids are Hispanic kids they're probably thinking oh he adopted them or that's a good thing that they're doing their\nYeah now\nI also think that gender has something to do with it because I think if it was a black woman with two white kids I don't think anybody would have cared as much so I think there's a little you know like it's a gender thing but this was ridiculous eventually the lady calls the ...\nWill see the police have to say about this early vote\nAs a Walmart yeah maybe I got to give them babies and we ate a subway or Walmart when guys some guys hold up talking about some of his okay she left came\nAfter this little girl so she can ask person the snow who I Am and then I went over to get some gas and Murphy she came back there\nAnd say they're going for euro\nYeah and and eventually the police do you guys OK and they're like yeah you know and they called the parents or the mom of of the kids and the mom thought it was a joke she was like what this is a joke right and they're like no this is for real\nIt it'll be made into something big uh I I I said take a step back\nAgain we live in the world of see something say something and if it was a white guy with the black kids probably not having the same issue I\nDon't know maybe but you know if it's a white guy with two Asians\nYou know two little Asian kids probably like I say the Hispanic is probably the thinking and I also say if it was a black woman with white kids probably wouldn't have said anything it might be just you know what might be a gender thing more than anything else think about that three two three five three twenty four twenty three at ... shows your Twitter tweet at us\nDamn man just

you don't believe the accuser no matter what if you believe that not the allegation but the evidence is what should be the determining factor\nThan you are an enabler about rapists of a gang rapist\nThat's what they were trying to sell us think about that and that's why every ... when he said you know he's voting because of that\nThat I started thinking just in our popular culture that all the different lawyer shows from Perry Mason to matlock to law and order from 'cause I think law and order started what an eighty nine or\n... I yes Eighteen eighty nine [laughter]\nBefore TV so much but you you think of all the lawyer shows out there uh-huh right right that ... and so when we talk about the fact of the ignorance of the American public ignorance does not mean stupid\nNow the Democratic leadership may think people are stupid we believe people may be uninformed we don't believe people are stupid and never had it in half\nIgnorance simply means you lack the fax it doesn't mean that you can't understand the facts and you can't go search for the facts or that you're dumb it simply means you don't have the facts for whatever reason yes I Will say I do believe some people are stupid like those Republicans who made my taxes go up\nBut [laughter] other than that\nOf the [laughter] other than that we no problem with the you know we have a problem with who have a problem we have a problem with everybody let's be honest\nTrust me but and and and so but but think about this and the Democrats are trying to sell to the American public after how many decades of television shows hounding lawyer shows us over and over again where it has become absolutely crystal clear too\nThere's a there's one part of just one part of it\nThat and that is that you know your for you that really was a live on well up until the evening of election day [laughter] and they were I mean they were practically themselves holding the parade they really were celebrating\nAlready on election day before the numbers came in\nAnd so\nThat you for your isn't there a you know Chuck Todd doing you know his analysis and everything on on all of that you can't really apply a history especially the twenty sixteen election when you're talking the presidential race\nYou have to look a in those house and Senate races you have to look at either the last midterm or separate the presidential race twenty sixteen from the house and Senate races of twenty sixteen yes\nAfter the first midterm that any president goes through there often is a shift right so you could apply that generally speaking and we may just see that in the house but don't count it don't count it just yet\nEight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre trip inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified\nDuring their next pre or post trip inspection check all safety equipment including fire extinguishers triangles and spare refuses to make sure they're in the proper location in the event and emergency responders trying to locate the\nFire extinguisher it's crucial that it's in the proper place and easy to find th trucks service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip is the surface of the aid truck service road squad if you break down we show up ... eight hundred nine two four shot\n[noise] was it for ... radio with every quarterly Hillary McNamara [noise]\nEvery Tuesday and Thursday morning at one am central it's the freight minor runs smart our on red eye radio tuned in to help you run more efficiently brought you buy a freight line or trucks and\nDrivers apps on your phone and get more stores funny videos but I wanted to make life easier on the road well you've got the my pilot out from pilots\nFlying J you can reserve odd shower seem real time parking war starts off right here to even get savings and rewards of all was the touch of a buddy you want it we got it in pilot flying J download the Fremont pilot Avon start saving today\nWith forty years of experience in the heavy duty engine all category the makers of ... engine oil believe that what matters most is often unseen it's found inside\nAnd that includes the technology behind ... for Fifteen W forty we actively put our shower ... products to protest against the competition and while some may feel that all of those are the same the fact is sometimes are not in a recent test a sample of mobile delve back Thirteen hundred super Fifteen W forty\nFailed to meet the standards for his capacity controlling oxidation control required to meet the A.

S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon they do want to do things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nOr this news item the cofounder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier ...\nFor those of you that are brand new listeners will do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about uh the Democrats accused the Trump or the campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack\nAnd or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign paid a law firm ... who paid and opposition research from\nA a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\nReally know the average Virginia Republican subpoena Simpson on September twenty ninth or after\nThe lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the lawyers say they're trying to fight here's I either ... or they're going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a a\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you are listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought\nThat up I I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I Would that they're going to ask them about Kanye West [laughter] probably not\nProbably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the\nUh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes the\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed\nAs the and an associate deputy attorney general ah\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he ... he yes from the department of justice\nYes yes yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on unofficial yes device from the department and I and and again if the those are the ... that's the number of ... right away from the point being is that\nYou look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into\nBruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm yes I have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand ... what I Would wonder is a blend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't\nLet let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask his lawyer then what do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look at ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russia collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know of of fusion GPS committing any crime I don't know I'm One I don't know where there was any evidence of it\nYou would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money from ... thrown opposition research firm that just on the level is is that is what you do you get hurt on the other\nParty's candidate or whatever you you do opposite well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about what would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\n\nWell ... Anaheim during the time on this interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior out testify I'll go under oath I'll do there are plenty of people that don't wander oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... that what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going to try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis farm yes\nAre the questions that what those are questions on the investigator would have running through their mind yes elite yes that's all we're not indicting\nWe're not indicting anybody yet\n[laughter] ha I'm just I was that out loud [laughter] sorry [laughter] the microbes on eight six six Ninety read I\nAnd if you're not fueling at a TA

Botox is going to be talking to light about parenting and a couple of terms that have been used over the years of one or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been reached by our guest Dr John Huber clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health doctors uber thank you for being with us tonight\nWell thank you for having me orange him I appreciate\nAll right the first term is a helicopter bombs or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is a term or referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you admit that\nMuch but that's a pretty good definition and I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least\nThey deserved things in life because their parents did this\nAll right uh that that's something else that it it seems to be that\nThat the generation that has provided us with helicopter parents\nOr their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where the I mean a ... it's hard for me to to think that\nBefore this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a a generation before that of parents that are essentially provided the role model for these people uh it it seems to me that these people sort of sprung up a a all their old and the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back a that many generations doesn't\nIt doesn't really I mean there's some\nNo it doesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who've always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation it as a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents had to have had to scrimp and saving do without during the war and so\nGetting much less of that than the helicopter kid from the helicopter\nSo it's getting worse it's helicopter parents on steroids\nExactly exactly\nWow All right let's let's talk more about that in the company of among others the tonight the dog who calls him from Albany, Oregon at the weather channel and even though and they're good at doing fine thank you\nYou're in great myself I just got to say the helicopter and warm or parents sound like the kind of parents who were glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles but that was possible\nWasn't now you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much they're a dichotomy and there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think that the Don may be closer to the literal truth of he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I don't think actually correct unfortunately what that ... is a a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit that completely entitled they deserve this\nAnd you know I was taught right off day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to to get anywhere in this world\nYou know what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think ... to your your thoughts on because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo me right now uh you know I I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the the young people I Know my my that my my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally a course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties\nOr the ones I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not this category\nOr I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and yes that includes bumps grapes a failures of picking yourself a dusting yourself off and and the whole learning experience is there any kind of a\nOf originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have never actually met a helicopter parent much less a lawnmower parent [laughter]\nWell I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six and killed two thousand was Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to step away from that was probably the last four years\nI we get calls from parents going what do you mean my travel got us thirty on their tests and I go well I Can't even confirmed what your kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAnd you used to be when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level not even at the high school level wow a I had
