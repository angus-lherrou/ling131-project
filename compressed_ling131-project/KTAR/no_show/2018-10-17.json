where you take me so when we got on the topic of who you'd like to see\nRun against President Trump the matter which side you're on the president's somebody you were also in having the vice presidential choice\nIt evolved in I don't know if there's even my idea that hey who would you sit down and maybe have a cup of coffee or could have a coke with cars that it's not that I'm trying to get you to get a look at it as much as the way it used to be that you know you have your politics you have your views and then there's still people right\nAnd you hope they're decent but it just it suggests the times we live in\nWhere people don't even want to sit down with the other side or you know they're just so angry right I I don't blame you after the Kavanaugh hearings I I wouldn't want to sit down with a sport I guess they you know I think he's got an unnamed we've got to keep that going Booker\nKamala Harris what a ... a piece of work she is and the listening Pocahontas right the list goes on and on so I I get it that's why I came up with Bernie Sanders 'cause\nI don't know he spoke English is can be in my opinion but\nI mean when did he go to Brooklyn College where I Would I think he did\nUm and if he didn't he certainly from New York City and uh so I thought you know I could sit there with Bernie ... maybe it would walk away when he heard my views I don't know maybe they'd be intolerant but let me know what you think and let's go to a chat in Decatur, Illinois chatty around with mark\nAnd mark how are you going to see real well and Eric that's good to hear\nA I Would like to see oh Alec Baldwin run for president\nDid you hear that that someone else has suggested that oh no I didn't hear anybody else it just\nYeah yeah how come\nI Would like to see that I Would also like to have a cup of coffee with him again energy I won't shut up about it [laughter]\nYou but you guys do he he hasn't announced you you're cheating you got to follow the rules someone\nI Know but a lot of the people that you're bringing up haven't announced either Pocahontas now\nA ... okay you're right you got me there so I don't I won't say now for those who we are actively ... no way I'm trying to get out of this give me a chance those are actively considering we get to have a pretty good guess and I you know what you I'm going to keep you on but I Want to read the list it's not fair so here's the list that I haven't gotten I mean there are others like\nLike I forgot Bloomberg so he'd be on the list so the Spartacus Booker attorney general Eric Holder Bernie Sanders Pocahontas lives with Warren Joe Biden\nI had a guy I used to have a show local sure where I did two Democrats versus two Republicans every week and we everybody got along well in some became um best friends but that was one guy he moved away from California any on Facebook not just to meet everybody said anybody who could support Donald Trump is no longer a friend of mine and among friending you\nSo I think it's going to do that or at least throw it out there last night I Want to hear those stories and what you've done some of them are really sad\nPeople lost their whole family or certainly you better not do to Thanksgiving the maybe we'll do that tomorrow night for tonight who is your choice for president at least for now and who could you have a cup of coffee with don't cheat

you were looking on the ah the strain issue you know we're talking about it and so it's good to talk to you again [noise] um I I wanted to go\nBack to something you said earlier I Believe you're referring to something somebody said about a dozen times that we live and and\nI hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you but I think we're looking at it in a different sense that I think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more it's the media so ... and they're out there they don't care now\nThat I've been trying to hide what tests that they believe in and they don't care\n[laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage and that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but I Want to get your take on that\nYeah you wow you you made a point I should have brought up thank you Daniel the the influence from the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertaining when I used to watch Johnny Carson\nOh uh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal but he never had it out there now again he was a comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more of blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name ...\nI don't want their land [laughter] want to say that they may not in the rye and my ...\nAnd you know I mean right and he wants to publicity and they don't you're right and I there is any more they don't hide biased they act like advocates if they're not journalists\nOver the problem I have what it is is that this is supposed\nTo be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an immature a point of view away to perceive them and then look at things it it means that\nYou can't help out other people and that's not what America's about [noise]\nI I got to answer your but I've got aunts my producer who just told me said the Anderson Cooper no 'cause I thought of Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give them publicity but that's the guy and he loves it it's about [laughter] and so I'm playing right into you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producer he doesn't have it\nThat he's told me to [laughter] wrong but there's so many that means that you're right right they they want to take on the role of being a powerful to and making them they're not supposed to do that\nIf it was like that and if so you are to complement to Daniel you win the prize oh they're going to run of the time who who your choices for president real quick\n[noise] uh I like Trump\nI Know but I'm you were supposed to do the other side who could you have a cup of coffee and the other side\nThat will Hillary was running for the White House or the Democratic party didn't want her speaking about issues because they knew that she was so ill informed we'll talk about it and such\nAnd I don't understand how this country can pick a Democrat\nFor any position that will not talk about the issues that will do nothing but\nCall somebody a racist homophobic\nMassage enlisted and this kind of stuff they getting nothing done when you don't speak about issues no work gets done that's what this country needs\nPeople to speak about issues balloon problems can be fixed the country can be fixed

you'll worry it Newt Gingrich\nIs running it man and it and if Trump or near the White House\nOr pets pets as a would be good also because I think he's learned a lot but I Would ... would be Newt Gingrich as I said he's ... and a thanks for letting me speak and uh\nI'll Wait wait wait wait and yet but it was a\nNo no no you got to tell me who you'd have coffee with on the Democratic side\n\nProbably an analyst with the war to try to try to talk to themselves or her stupid head about her claim of men Native American first\nAll right you you got out of it that way it's supposed to
