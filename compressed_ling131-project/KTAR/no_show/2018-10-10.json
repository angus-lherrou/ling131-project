afraid of the mass right and then we we all kiss a bunch of asked to make ourselves feel good it's like people who who are or a phone number Donald a couple of weeks ago making fun of the fact that all these comedians will just walk out and they'll say something horrible about Trump\nBecause they know what's going to get a cheap laugh 'cause everybody's afraid to ... you know we are what is

because of the masses and because people are afraid to say anything and again this is part of why Trump is where he is\nThis is absolutely why Trump is where he is because he is a reaction to the weird wacky politically correct climate where people just got sick and tired of being sick and tired of being sick and tired of pullout horrible they are and how bad they are and all of these things that Trump just goes out and he says stuff\nRight or wrong he says stuff and for a lot of people out there they're fine with that they're over this crap there over feeling bad and now we have to believe everybody right of a woman says it's got to be true no truth is\nAnd if the truth comes out that that person did something horrible then you'd go after them in the right way but if the truth stops being searched for the minute we accuse somebody but because it feels good it's always the feeling part so that it feels nice feels nice\nFeels nice we talk about this because it feels nice that's crap we got to stop this alpha male stuff no no\n\nNo one can idiots we need to stop but men being men\nRight there's nothing wrong with that we've gotten to this point in the world who were

but if there is a great expansion of wealth as the economy is ah you know chugging along at a pretty good pace right now\nThan sometimes that again it it only slows down or slows down temporarily or it doesn't really a handwritten much but we'll see uh where where they are ... we're we're typically in the season where a lot of you know\nA home buying is not done because families especially I don't want to change uh schools ah right here in the heart of the school year so they'll wait until the spring uh to to buy but we'll see what that does typically it again it moves it somewhat but in a growing economy\nThat's very different it's a different consideration if you've got a great job if you if you believe you got job security and good pay\nA you know for example looking at the two year treasury bills because when I see the interest rates going up on that that means interest rates going up on the debt\nTreasury bills land you're one point for nine percent now two point eight doubled right oh yeah yeah that's going to mean a lot of very bad things in the future because the fact\nThat we we quit a caring I Know our our listeners and conservative friends still care about the debt and the fiscal policy of the U.S but the the people in Washington don't because\nDump because by and large because most Americans don't if we were all screaming about it in unison does it would be the number one concern of theirs but it's not\nThey are twenty feet I called and talk to him just a minute ago uh therefore their team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet above sea level now they're\nOptimistic that they won't see a storm surge um that will get up to the station\nRight and they're also optimistic that the generators or continue the ... power generator will work and the station is fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until a later this afternoon right um\nBut obviously I tomorrow if we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them and a half\nAfter it is passed by right um but I think our prayers need to be with all the people who are\nUp and down that coastline there are there because they realize that\nEven though the majority of people of evacuating it out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds get up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins um\nBut that being said\nEven though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's over with they're going to be\nIn there in force I Know\nAre surrounding a Panama City they've got I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida\nHas called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh guardsmen or guards folks ah [laughter]\nAnd uh the same is true 'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically um declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask this because you did or you had predicted a before the last ah advisory that show that went to a category of for you predict the would go up a couple of ... of a of a more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five two hundred and thirty and you hit it right\nYou expected to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nAh no I don't see a weakening is gets closer to shore in this particular case um the uh the water hasn't been touched\nSo we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature um the other thing that's going on is that\nUnlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air there is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near\nThis and so uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and\nThen the mid west and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area head of the cold front\nThat warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and in the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't it won't die down\nOr whatever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to degenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine I'm\nEighty two maybe a little more than that mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachian coal a and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore or this afternoon\nAnd and and they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour ...\nAs so yeah this is this is a fascinating point um you you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen uh savannah\nBecause of the wind field is going to have wins that are being ... up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia coast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast um all of that area um potentially is far up as Morehead City um is going to feel the force\nIs going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of a Florida and crosses Georgia across Valdosta and probably somewhere between savannah and I'd go to a south of making and eventually comes up across Florence\nYeah kinda young and we're looking at I'm looking at the map right here and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get it by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and\nI didn't even mentioned Virginia but yeah it goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter that\nThe Windsor gonna bring onshore flow and it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped\nAnd rainfall figures for that particular area or are still pretty significant and I'm\nI'm we're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of eight inch rains\nWow wow uh and and that causes life threatening flash flooding yes yes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore\nHigh water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave earlier right um you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water you pick it up and go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool [noise] well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds I'm\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road\nWhich is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something even if we brought that down and have we're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it was be as if a\nA ... ton pickup truck we're at Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kind of bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah great point great point what often there are six\nThe salt water six its own level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be you know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of walk gallons of water on a giant entire I all of a grocery store rolling across continuously every minute across the road what are the odds is going to tear up that road and you think you'd just\nBeing tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't uh it relatively speaking it doesn't take a high water\nOr in order to move a vehicle I mean it it has that forces you read six inches right so you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot assessed possibly assess properly or in that situation and again he those warnings are there's absolutely no reason\nTo go through all high water or a a low area that has high water in these situations and heed the warnings of those local and state officials in the ... that are there in Florida and those other states that will be dealing with Michael over the next twenty four thirty six

O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. where one eight six six five oh jumbo and Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to lie that one\nOh here he was ... spending that my experience has been I'm sixty one years old I've I've tried ... travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on an on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where like in a south to North Carolina where the Florence hurricane to flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going yeah go go on the major freeways first and then wait for the Detroit then that's when you shouldn't you shouldn't start on the side roads because it because when there's a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay undeclared major uh I'm In a state and then and then then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side Roach that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what Anthony kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those roads you should at least be familiar with them so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track\nTo some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are gonna meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to take one of those rows\nSo when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it but if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that are being asked to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey\nI'm taking this beach all going to do to through this direction to that location so this way\nFamily members who you rely on those even the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning the text of the email that said once that sour turns on and the people on the other side\nGet that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a ... thank you Alan for your call them ... and your thoughts your or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nI'd makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you\nYou can set and activate your GPS for your family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS system so but in times of\nWeather related problems such as Michael\nYou know the storm skipped throw it down you know can take out technology\nAnd if the towers that of people that you're sending a signal to went down\nDance single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instilling received those messages so\nAs long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you're going that way and on the other side it's important to understand that they will receive it wants a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happens to you\nAnd I would just throw in a quick little plug for radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always there to serve you in such moments we got to Patrick in Rochester, Minnesota joining us tonight on the bull headed show with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\nA good

case you didn't know because it involves a a a\nTrigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the moment that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter a I Am not sure about this but I Would dare say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal\nInto hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other end practicalities of such an idea they're just too big and then he\n[noise] well you know let's put it this way\nLet's say the United states was to let's say all of this you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida are liable\nFor ... for this storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nOh we'll liable for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we went to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit that got to be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody will never found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action lead to one followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of a hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn them headed inland\nAnd the the I don't think anybody was ever able to tell if in fact the the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so ah the the fact is that that we just don't know enough about these things in the end of the Anthony notes quite correctly or\nA one of just simply changes course in and damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and uh I mean\nIt could be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do with the exact precision will take some more callers will be an
