moment\nTo think to yourself God my life is awful and crappy just a dumpster fire would be great to wake up tomorrow worth a billion dollars\nFor the rest of us out there who don't feel that way about their life would like to have a billion dollars that's why but for a lot of you out there that's what it's like now the reality is to witness would\nBe huge huge\nBut the odds are long\nThey are winning are still slim around one in three hundred million for each you're more likely to give birth to identical quandary worthless or become faint didn't win the jackpot\nHer big comet St while giving birth to ... or whatever being struck by lightning while riding around on a great white sharks back bats the odds of that\nBut the reality is everybody's got a chance that's the beauty of you may have bought a hundred tickets you may have bought one ticket but you've got to take a shot don't ya\nMore likely to get hit by lightning than winning and so you don't play that one either\nYeah now here's some issues okay now one of the things a lot of you out there played office pools do you understand how it works\nBecause\nMoney gets involved people get greedy and weird and then it goes south so take a deep breath and look around and say\nRise everybody and are they out we want to know for sure and there's a reason for that\nOffice pools don't always go as planned\nTo take the construction worker New Jersey who was in charge of buying the lottery tickets for his work pool but without telling anyone he claimed to thirty eight million dollar when for himself alone he was sued and lost which is why experts say set the ground rules early and in writing\nYeah one hundred percent early and in writing because the lawsuits are going to have because what ends up happening is people totally get involved and they said well wait a minute here\nI was here every day for a year and I gave you money and at times I was wondering I got the tickets and I happened to be out because it's my daughter's anniversary graduation slash whatever christening of grandbaby and then all of a sudden you guys don't count me into this knowing full well put money into lawsuits come in it's a nightmare\nHere's the other people change and I'm not talking about a lottery winners there's going to be some change there but the fact is everybody around you in some way shape or form is going to change because you're\nLonger the person that was the next door neighbor you're now a bank account you're no longer the person\nThe shape or form is going to change because you're no longer the person that was the next door neighbor you're now a bank account you're no longer the person\nWho just lived a normal life like everybody else you're now worth hundreds of millions of dollars and everybody who's got a wacky idea a crazy idea or who's been there with you feels that you should invest and or do you owe them something so a lot of times what happens is\nPeople actually change far more than the winners do and it happens in everything look at sports look at people who've become famous ... when it comes in the entertainment world they'll tell you\nThat it's a lot of times the people around you that change and then they're mad because you don't give in to whatever it is that they want\nSo you got to be strong you gotta know there are some people you're going to help and the other people out there that you're not going to help\nBecause you know they're only here because your third cousins twice removed and they have you ever talked to him for Fifteen Years but they're calling 'cause I got a great investment opportunity and they just happened\nOh you won the lottery I didn't know that yeah yeah yeah hit the road a three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you I bet that shows your Twitter you could tweet at us every single day at this time we like to give you a little something something something something we called us or urban word of the day\nFor the urban word of the day I Am right now talking to a little more on the street I Can't understand a word for\nToday\nAfter you win the lottery or I win the lottery I'll be putting on my serving looks what does that that somebody who is on point everything about them is on point I'm going out and I'm going to serve the world the best of me oh yeah\nI Am dial to the nines in my outfit my hair looks did like never

sort of for the children of racism after school programs and things like me for the ...\nEverybody's going to have some I mean everybody like something that you're going to do that nice things that you do for somebody or something I think it's great I Do and I remember if you've ever known anybody who has a lot of money a lot of times what ends up with money is that person usually if they weren't\nJerk there were jerk if they were poor and if they're good people it just allows him to be better people right\nThat's that's the reality of a lot of what happens to people are some does it change a few people yes but by and large it's just allows you to be more of who you are much I've known people with tons of money I've known people with money like you couldn't believe with the B\nWord that's right and I knew before too and they were kinda jerky and I knew him after and there was still kind of jerky so it just allows you to be more who you are three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your Twitter\nYou can tweet at us love hearing from you Mitch McConnell Nancy Pelosi they've got something in common and it's not a good thing and and that's very little to do with them talk about that midterms as well and how the way that it make a haul away and if you are happy the way to the Senate such a [noise]\n\n... [noise]\n\n\nDo you like saving money do you like knowing someone has your back as you're getting older and starting to be faced with the reality of Medicare and the future\nOf Social Security my partners at the association of mature American citizens otherwise known as a Mac or focus on protecting the interest to mature Americans meaning anyone over fifty\nEverywhere you look there's something new and that's why we say data and facts are amazing but it it's who's giving you the facts what numbers who's asking\nThe questions how were they asking\nThe question that\nSpeak the truth is that they had a big lead at one point in time but I'm not quite sure that there anymore\nHere's what our brand new and be seen as Wall Street journal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters Democrats hold a seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one\nFor eternal poll shows with just over two weeks to go until the mid term among registered voters Democrats hold a seven point lead in the generic ballot forty forty one of them that I can leave from the twelve point leave Democrats held just a month ago pre Kavanaugh when it was fifty two forty\nYeah and now you've got this caravan which I think it's going to be a big thing\nBut Trump's been going around and you can do it everywhere he goes pretend I'm On the ballot for attack because in many ways he is especially when it comes out I think the Senate they're going to pick up a few seats in the Senate there were too many Democrats in red states that had to defend\nWhat looked like a super nominee in the house maybe more of a trickle so he said hey pretend I'm Out there and guess what right now for Trump\nAsked for President Trump he has his best numbers in in our poll among registered voters forty seven percent approve of his performance in office or forty nine percent the support that the ... better than his numbers last month in our poll\nForty four fifty to approve disapproved but again among those likely voters his numbers they get worse forty five percent approve fifty two percent disapproved\nBut it should be among voters that show up and that's going to be the big thing is it going to be massive\nThat I don't know the fact is is\n[noise] I don't know who's showing up I don't know who's showing up because\nYou see all this stuff for like three weeks ago four weeks ago five which was a done deal it was a nominee coming\nI said yeah but they're probably hold on to the Senate but it could be massive tsunami then you had the Kavanaugh debacle and both sides really jak boots for the Senate I think as far as the Democrats\nAre they came out in the end when voters source voters in a way that it made them look for worse and now you've got people that are getting excited now you've got this other thing this caravan coming here\nAnd ... maybe that all that excitement enthusiasm that once was there isn't the way it's just it's not the way it is anymore\nPublications is only six months ago I think we were all talking about a blue wave that we knew was coming and it was going to be very significant we're not quite talking that way anymore it looks kind of more interesting and complicated in state by state\nYeah and it's and it and it's going to be much closer than people think\nI don't I don't know\nI I ... and the people I talked to 'cause I look a lot of the polls are some of them who is asking the polls the second thing is is is balance\nRight balance is huge how many ballots have gone out those kind of those things are big the look at a lot of people are are and then you've got to start putting stuffed together she ... she got polls then you've got to move should up together and try to come out and at this point in time I think for all intents and purposes is the best guesstimate\nWhen it comes to it and I I couldn't tell you I could not tell you at this moment in time what I Do know is I ... of of all the things I can tell you I think\nFor the people I've talked to one of looked at the Senate\nLooks like they may pick up a couple of seats the Republicans the house was once a big worry for the Republicans of it being an absolute just slaughter now they feel like they have a hunters chance of holding on to it but even if they lose it it's not going to be by\nA huge margin and in some ways that's a victory it is\nNow we live in a new world of politics and I'm going to say this coming up with something that ... that is just very very sad I don't like it Eric Trump spoke about this the other day and and I think it's ... we've got to start standing up\nA Maxine Waters I'm looking right to you because I think I've had enough of this and most people I Know Seventy percent of us are in the middle\nWe don't really identify with either party we're we're in the middle\nThere's Fifteen Percent on either side or or or depending on what you're looking at maybe eighty percent of us in the middle and and twenty percent of the size of ten percent I tried\nThat is just insane and\nWe need to start speaking up more I like civility in this world\n... America might have people on the right they might have you on the left one America doesn't like what I don't like\nHis radical right and and they have become a mob left has\nBecome a mob the vast majority of them you see on TV you see the lighting pickup trucks on fire him yelling at people in restaurants when they're going out to a nice dinner with their wives the one day a week with Ted Cruz you saw you know you saw what happened here they're making Ted Cruz looks like a sympathetic harassing at the Supreme Court worthwhile making funny I I mean people are into the stuff I Know people want civility\nYeah you know what they do they do and no matter what a lot of people say they will and TV you guys are just now it's ridiculous both sides or part of a case in point something that I Will\nNo matter what a lot of people say they will and TV you guys are just now it's ridiculous both sides or part of a case in point something that I Will point out both sides of the ... this is Mitch McConnell the other night with his wife at a restaurant hanging out [noise]\n\n\n\nYeah so they threw left that are sold them to get out of the country get the hell out of their banged on the table took the goody bags that it was like a doggy bag and it's ridiculous Nancy Pelosi and an event and coral Gables\n\n[laughter]\nI had enough of that you know what both sides are clowns those are the extremist we don't need Maxine Waters I was looking right at you because you've told people to go out and get in each other's faces you've told people that I'm looking right at you this rhetoric this kind of attitude has if it doesn't do anything\nGoing up to Seventy something year old woman or man and getting in their faces if you got the whole nice of steel to do something like that step off have a debate I have a conversation so you know what Mitch I don't I don't like the way you handle things\nUh I'm just letting you know that and you walk\nOn but doing what you're doing is ... it really is it is absolute just and it doesn't help anything there's no conversation here it's a joke it is but this is what happens when we the mass\nKeep our voices quite and allow the few the bully pulpit the microphones the bull horns to do whatever they want\nIt's okay to have this course it's okay to sit down and talk it's okay to protest it's great part of being but then there comes a point where this is a joke\nAnd this is one of those things below sea to deserve that Mitch McConnell doesn't deserve that this is a joke it really really is\nWhy don't you go after Republican leaders the way Republicans go after democratic leaders\nI don't think it's a phone message the realtors the\nVoters are listening for both political parties to say something other than a political ... underway in Washington they're looking for us to address the issues that affect them and their future the costs to preserve prescription drugs whether they've saved up enough money for retirement making sure the health insurance is available and affordable\nThese are things that Dr a message on the Republicans can win on those issues so they get personal\nOr I've talked to a lot of\nReally look in the left as both sides to somebody just to extend the real culprits Trump really I don't think Trump or no talk ... absolutely absolutely wrong he says things that drives me crazy a lot of people out there\nBut the Maxine Waters of the world screaming and yelling and say getting people's face go out do those kinds of things come up enough both sides\nWe need to stand up and look at somebody a bit we'll say what would you have done to somebody who say that the below zero went over to the front of the guy like look I may not agree with their politics but this is this is this is yes same thing with Mitch McConnell doesn't help at all three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and Joe is your Twitter you can tweet at as a Mac\nOr are you ready to join a Mac huh\nYou're ready to join a organization that's going to go out there and fight for you it's going to go out and fight for things like small business owners tax reform things like immigration reform that's common sense go out there and fight to to stop\nThe push of government run health care that's what a Mac is it is the conservative alternative and are you ready for one year free\nToday view over the age of fifty they're not even ask you for credit card all they want you to sign up in his simple it is easy go to a M.
