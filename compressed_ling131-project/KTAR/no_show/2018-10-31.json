wait a minute just trying to change the constitution\nActually one of the fourteenth amendment to the U.S constitution says all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the

you at all with Trump\nThere isn't even that it's either they like you were they hate you very few people in the middle as far as their feelings their even people that vote for Trump I've talked to people who vote for Trump who can't stand Trump wanted anybody but Hillary or a Bush we've talked about that but they like his actions but they can't stand him as a person\nSo even some people who are like what he does have stand who he is\nAnd you know you you get people there today who are upset who are angry because of what happened and they're not directly blaming him for this\nBut they're just saying\nHow 'bout you come out\nWeek and he said look this is the only time right now during midterms that I have to\nNext week and he said look this is the only time right now during midterms that I have to do this this is it and [noise] didn't damned if you do and\nDamned if you know three two three five three twenty four twenty three actually I've been to Joe's your Twitter user without us love

or urban word of the day\nIt's half of the urban word of the day finding I'm right now time to get a little more hit on the street talking understand a word you're saying before\nFeels what's that I got feelings for somebody who got feels for her I get the feel for him I got to feels for that kind of one of those things where you know you like somebody you know like so and so given you the field is is she yeah she is\nShe feels huh oh ho yeah she is [noise]\nThat's crazy you get the feel for you feel is your urban word of the day\nThank you for saying that in dated urban place about our understanding that there was an urban were of the day we damn stress shore cranium\nHe has certainly I think found those moments to bring our country together and certainly focus on some of the things that all of us can support and all of us can condemn as well\nYeah yeah yes and at times it [noise] it it's never enough right he comes out and says white supremacy or even with an awful\nAnd let's be fair to ourselves\nNot so much of Lincoln an odd but you know just kind of you know I mean there there was a time where I could have I I Wish you would have done more when it comes to\nThis and the shooting\nNo but people are saying this isn't about him and this is about the people that have died I agree I absolutely agree this is about the people that are mourning the people who have been through this is the tragedy that took place in that neighborhood that is undeniable but you can't say you want the president there and then at the residents don't doesn't show up at the third time that you want\nBut it's it's a no win situation I get what you wouldn't want them there any time of president Joseph anywhere whether they're loved or hated it is chaos\nHe just absolute chaos\nSo I can understand why you wouldn't want him there at this moment in time\nBut then the people on the left and everybody else who's a critic I Can't say he's not trying\nTo unite the country because no matter what he does it will never be enough free you're just looking for what you're you're always looking for the gotcha moment 'cause that's what we were gotcha society every questions the gotcha we want to put people in situations that are gotcha so it doesn't matter\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... and show is your Twitter you can tweet at us I've got a crazy commercials come out for\nMidterms which is really kind of interesting will touch on that [noise] Halloween are you excited with some of your favorite movies I'm going to be dressing up tomorrow I've got a couple of different outfits are will debut and he took it on Facebook and few other places such and such a [noise]\n\n\nSuch adventure and show [noise]\n\nDo you like saving money do you like knowing someone

the east side long those and the crypts and the great strict crypts and we're rolling twenties all kind of affiliated enough with each other they were going to cause problems\nRight so but what what ...\nThe kids that I knew that we are gang members when I talk to them they felt at a uh some of it was at a need some of that as a necessity that this was essentially became their family right now take it to the point where you don't even need to do that anymore because the gangs or\nThis was essentially became their family right\nNow take it to the point where you don't even need to do that anymore because the gangs are virtual and you can energize them that way\nThese groups have become very adept at\nSpreading their message of hate and their ideology online and they do so with the the specific intention of influencing disaffected violence proud mentally on balance individual\nYeah and that's big because what you're trying to do like somebody who gets murdered ... Mars themselves for for you know for whatever reason\nRight like a you know they're gonna blow themselves up they're going to crash a plane or whatever they're going to do what are those people\nDisenfranchised a lot of times they're desperate or some of them have families to try to take their their in a situation where it's no when and what if people that put their arm round of\nYou know you're doing this for Allah think of all the things you're going to get sick of all of this right you're doing this for you're doing this for whatever reason it's going to be great to me major your family and you know what else is because we can be cheering you're going to remember who you are they going to remember your name\nThe loners the same thing disenfranchised not quite all they're angry pissed off at the world blaming everything 'cause they're massive losers you get somebody going that that that is just in the echo chamber same things over and over again and now and the difference is sometimes some people are trying to 'course you into doing things\nThat you would by the way never given those people of course and then never going to do that\nWhere sometimes people are just in the echo chamber and saying things back and forth back and forth back and forth and that's not good but social media for all the great stuff it brings you\nFor all the fun right without\nRealizing it in many ways that the spread of hatred out there because people on both sides of the aisle people on both sides of the love hate world they they use it and I think there's a lot more positivity out there the negativity but negativity like everything is that greasy wheel squeaks we'd squeak so it's going to get the oil\nTerrorists groups like ISIS and al ... and domestic extremist groups whether they be neo Nazi groups are anti government militia groups have all learned that they can influence a much larger group of people when they use social media\nYeah yeah much looked much larger why would I Want to speak to the people down the street where I could get forty or fifty when I can have five thousand or ten thousand\n...\nIt's I can somewhat renting a remain anonymous\nIt's it's crazy it is\nAnd you've seen enough chicken anti Semitism and it's not just crazy white people I think a lot of people just only white people there there's been an uptick of anti Semitism for the last couple of years uh and I know Trump gets blamed for everything but you know what the\nPlenty of blame for everybody to go around it it it's I'm sick of the blame game that the blame game sold nothing like how did we get here how do we go about fixing this\nWater or the the the tactics that we need to start taking and addressing without crushing people's free speech right without getting allowing corporations to dominate\nAnd and set up the you know Google has a good sense or\nYou know we don't want that but what can we do to be fast acting and and first into this and police ourselves through a certain way because what ends up happening is that what we're not policing ourselves when we're not going out there and fighting the good fight of you know not being a holes what ends up happening is Google and everybody else thinks that they have to do it for us\nAnd we're not going to you I don't care what you do you're not going to save everybody you're not going to stop every crazy person with a gun you're not going to stop every evil person with a gun no matter how many measures you take\nI think a lot of people think that\nAnd that's just not the way it does and the more that you disenfranchised and piss some of these people off the further they go underground the more angry they get then you start to lose touch with them and that's when it becomes even scarier three two three five three twenty four twenty three I had been since ... who is your Twitter Paul question up today with the birthright citizenship\nKerfuffle that Trump has thrown out there

ways that kind of took it a and it's all their fault that Trump's in office\nWhile they're trying to make the point the point to me made me laugh is they don't show up\nWe've heard before right were you know we heard that you see I said you know what we can get all excited and do you want but don't count it as a show up on election day and that is the truth don't count all your eggs that basket

Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you guys all discussion but uh but what was I don't understand why\nSome people are saying or playing the birthright executive order proposed by Trump\nOr the president is stupid 'cause ... executive order clarify law by our my understanding why can't a president clarify what the actual author and you got guys talking about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that\nThe fourteenth amendment does not extend to aliens or people vote for a nation giving birth in our nation well\nThe the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got the SCOTUS it would be the job skills to interpret that would be the top of his ... it would it be his job of his lawyers to defend\nIt but the secular border self a is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual\nThe actual court case so did he got could have branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now if a ... a very pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge\n[laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge then it would it would stand and it would be the law the land well yeah 'cause that was the question gardener yesterday which I thought was a stupid question\nKind of president right an executive order to change the law and and what did hold on to well yeah sure he could write an executive order for a ham sandwich I'd ... I'd rather do many challenges yeah then yeah but it's going to study there'll be an injunction\nAnd there'll be an injunction and the law will never to which I find like would be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department maybe some input her ideology here to say that\nYou know let's attempt to get this at at at least for the president I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen\nOn controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about uh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or ... or at least the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't run out of the I I don't I don't I don't believe it ever will but but\nI still do when people say well he's just does she just campaigning\nAndme\nOur ... will not doing this is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's not exceed that's my mind that that was where I don't exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI could see if you're upset saying he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill tried to paint herself as a Republican fry just who happens to be running as a Democrat yes now that's something you shouldn't complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have\nNow when you got many Democrats trying to portray themselves as oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats on I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign but Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons is he got elected was illegal immigration\nAnd immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to ah just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing\nOnly way you could make that point is if he financed the caravan which I don't believe he did I don't think so and they're\nThe only way you could make that point is if he financed the caravan which I don't believe he did\nI I don't think so and therefore when this is happening he's doing but he believes he should do might help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on\nAnd if he's consistent in his opinion why would anybody it buddy be upset about it or college strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans ... right exactly that's a campaign in that you should be upset about\nBecause that would be an action and I the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged in court he knows that so he is setting it up for the fight but it is also part of the positioning yet politically\nAnd for dogs ... when I saw her recently I said hey how many catch you have now and she said well I have four dogs and said oh what I said what nine cats ten thirty three\nThirty three cats yes her and her spouse actually put a extra room on the house\nSo the cats can walk in and out to none heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together well but\nThirty three that's three cases of cat food a day [laughter] [laughter] I I don't know which is bad name\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Belgium we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million patch heavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume too the waste that they produce in the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume\nAs a significant portion of their diet animal products\nAnd therefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims ...\nHere the energy in animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including Finkel production the\nProblem isn't just the United states now or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world and I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we owned more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\n...\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit ones or the or that jazz okay we'll just so so what do we do with the dog\nWe supposed to put the dog down or just after this dog not get another one hey I never search for a cat ... I rescued one\nHad rescued you let's be clear right by the way you're not the only person that sets that to me this week yeah I think we all know that ah [laughter]\nAnd ah\nA black cat just revised Halloween on Halloween you know the funny thing is ... I had I had a a bug few weeks ago\nAnd I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector actually the smoke detector ... I thought it was a battery but smoke detector\nWent defective and it you know beeps after about ... euro yeah the toll is part of my house of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I've got this incredible ladder widened base and everything else and so I was like\nOh of course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I've got this incredible ladder wide base and everything else and so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that ladder out and really test its capabilities right so I get up there and realize okay this is in my I I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days so do I take down the ladder not leave the ladder they've it or leave it why take it down yeah the letters there for a couple of days\nAnd I keep noticing that the cat black cat eats walking under the ladder thought that if there's a lot so I figured it was all that stuff and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good luck thoughts I never had before yeah ah but\nAh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help and emotional benefits would considerably reduced she's impacts\nThe other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian nope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best\nFor your pets yes\nParticular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous\nYeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo no\nI mean so uh are there you go the study the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah that's actually a point\nBut to encourage Americans to consume less meat so that's the point All right I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian I'm literally thawing\nTo stakes right now I'm going to you both of them today\n\nI might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat\n[noise]\nMy favorite one remember this goes back ten years ago\nI think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that we need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he has no bigger than twenty five thousand people ... and ... ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go yeah\nWe don't want to go to I think was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere where do you do with them I don't know like we have to [laughter] what do you do with and who decides who goes\nAnd and I think it was one of the of the probably the closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one right so what do you do it to\nMe [laughter] okay what's what's your plan I they are just going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works [laughter] are you committing suicide first yeah\nRight hey that'd be a cool psi phi movie right it's the end of the planet we're down to what ten years just some kind of doomsday whatever\nClimate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base 'cause that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say\nYou know the big chunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over the period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow\nUm [laughter] so [laughter] that's not making about climate change this time about whatever right\nBut if we could whittle it down to one billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make this the series over the period of years you know 'cause you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out\nTo got to pick her up to deplete the population\n[laughter]\nI don't remember [laughter] remember Star Trek didn't remember how the the two forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that that you kill a thousand\nUm they like managed war and then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall and the ... member that one yeah I don't know they were they open the window and they were like\nAll these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how would they ever solve that\nProblem yeah I don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand and six\nUh I haven't\nSeen it was about essentially a the there was women could not\nUh I haven't seen it was about essentially a the there was women could not give birth there was what ever happened to the apocalypse they no longer have the ability to give birth and then all the all the sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her because all governments would want you know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and\nAnd they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protector but I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically as lessening not in the crazy way that the Democrats\nAre talking with far out far left liberals are talking about\nAnd did in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a psi phi thing of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean the ... it's it's not it would be one of those those questions almost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah\nOh yeah that was very clear that that uh Well Bruce Willis uh you know ... ... yeah it's got it's got to take one for the ... not no no that oh yeah no I was in Brussels in deep impact your thinking oh deep\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment

Adam ... part of the country you been to use the gym boat real fast [laughter]\nOh yeah now you're now that that makes all the difference in the world I think in your community status if you're a gym\nOh absolutely oh yeah the elevated me I think it may be a boy and a half on me started quotient there [laughter]\nSo you found your way to uh to Hollywood and the subtitles or the goes photographer Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of uh make believe published by a HBO in live in I Believe\nYes which is a part is Simon and Schuster\nYeah uh ... what exactly are we talking about in terms of the ghost photographer\nYou know I I Will tell you that at the heart of the book is actually a transformational a journey through grief\nUm because when I lost my mom to all timers um I was devastated and even five months after that I lost another very dear friend and tragically in a car accident and not long after I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nWhere you know like you were we come from this guy does sound like\nTo bart or tell them\nI Believe that it basically makes it a the Halloween Caesar and we're glad to be talking about those things just be tired spooky to bike with a Hollywood executives\nWho has written a creaky book the ghost photographer Julie ... our guest at a she has to put some considerable thought\nAt the imagination into this bill what's the uh the most uh I guess a scary or a realistic thing you've ever seen in this particular paid\nWell at this really great question because there certainly things that have been scary that I've seen and um and there's things that are scared that experience that actually didn't say\nI think that I had at one point I'm In the house I made that got I think after if you will the door kind of crash down into the other side for me\nUm had a lot of goes if you will that I'm kind of entered the house and we had\nHeaters turning on by themselves light of and computer ... it was it was absolutely insane um and so that was probably more frustrating but probably the scariest thing was the first goes to that I I I took a picture of because it was the idea of it\nActually scared me and this is where the Hollywood goes into play where students that they hold your guys\nAnd so I'm thinking to myself oh no have I open the portal\nAnd am I going to get sucked into it and you know start screaming out for Carolyn or something I I I really was petrified [noise] um I have I have seen\nUm some some scary scary goes that look like they've been beat up\nA ghost I had no idea [laughter] I didn't I think there would beat up before they cross over large city yeah and so there was one like I had a black guy and like uh\nI didn't I think they were beat up before they cross over wise yeah and\nSo there was one like had a black guy and like a a fat lip um so yeah there's been some scary things for sure but I think that first one was more scary for me 'cause I didn't know what the heck it happened\nIs Hollywood doing more of this now you had this return to the Halloween the movies with\nA a a\nCurtis jama Jamie Lee Curtis is are we going to see a return to those good old days of a of a scary this and the Freddie Krueger and that sort of thing\n[noise] you know kind of it looks that way doesn't it I think that guy's like a symbol on um have figured out how to make 'em really commercial\nUm horror films on and you know and it was so interesting I think about the horror genre and Hollywood is it really is that movie that you want to see in a theater because you want to be next to someone even if they're a stranger you know it's a it's a really great reason to go\nAnd have a communal experience\nIn terms of of of how we view these things anymore or the days of the the movie theater limited are we going to be downloading in the future\nAs far as I was asked that question a on a panel for my day job and um my answer was I Hope not\nBecause the way that we respond to storytelling at home is so muted compared to the way that we respond to them in theaters\nSo for instance um if you're watching a comedy\nAt home you might smirk you know might have a smile cross your face\nBut if you're in a theater and other people are laughing you laugh out loud and when you laugh out loud your body chemistry changes it actually it releases endorphins and so you enjoy yourself more so I I Hope it I Hope everything's not just download and we sat and watched things by herself\nThe the whole future of of Hollywood I suppose is is predicated to a certain extent on the on the various a revenue streams of theaters for example or get an awful lot of their money off of the concessions do they\nNot think so they do\nYeah does Hollywood kind of bad but if you're showing a blockbuster movie in the theater pools in the X number of dollars off of popcorn and the and the candy at twelve dollars a candy bar or just the the the the film producer get a cut of that that's where the money is\nI'm not that I'm aware of where you'd be where I Would agree yeah I Would be so I'm pretty sure we don't\nYou know All right uh in terms of of the\n... the creativity the that goes into a Hollywood productions it seems to be the some of the highest concentrations of creativity these days go knock it to the TV shows or even necessarily feature movies so to me the some of the highest levels of creativity at least\nPer per second of air time if you will go into music videos in commercials\nHuh you know what that's a really great question I you know I I can tell you and I think it depends upon the film you know when it comes to cost\nThat it it really depends upon the special effects you know the cost per second on an animated film is actually quite
