judge Judy judge Joe Brown judge dread Aaron Judge from the uh uh from the New York Yankees ... anybody there\nAnd this was a fight and the right would have done the same thing if the left had the opportunity for people to talk of America and you know one of the things that I don't think people realize Ninety seven percent I think is what they very Garland in him agreed on about Ninety seven percent of the cases\nThat that's pretty damn good right I mean it was climate change we all over but if it's this G so when I look at this and this is one thing we're going to touch on throughout the evening is the fact that I think there's two camps here\nYou've got an older generation a Gen actors you know mid to late thirties\nEnded the fifty forties and fifties and sixties who who who lived in a day and age of the Mad Men and some not so much in the crazy eighties and things of that nature and then you've got a younger generation of micro aggressions and things of that nature and when you\nLook at this I think there is a Jew wasted this me too movement is going a lot of women want\nPeople to understand the things that they have gone through that have been absolutely off the things that they've gone through that has been horrible the things that they've gone through that that really they they want people to know and\nWe absolutely should may have another generation which I Believe the younger generation is is looking at this is this is a weapon\nRight and it's not by the way it's not just the me too movement for the younger generation the fact is micro aggressions things of that nature\nBritish ... you and I talked about this with the yesterday that company last year where the interns decided they wanted a new dress code because they thought it was sexist and it was wrong and they went into the guy who owns a company and then the next day he fired them all\nAnd they couldn't understand why they couldn't understand why and this is the issue I think a lot of people are saying you've got two camps here fighting and it's it's it's really amazing to see because when I talk to younger generation\nIt is you've got to believe everybody period case closed when I talk to an older generation they still believe in due process\nThey couldn't believe what you're saying but they also want facts the younger generation just believes what she's saying or what somebody and they don't even care about facts you're guilty and even if you're proven innocent we're never going to change your mind about your and tell us that\nAnd that is it and like I said I think part of it is the entitlement world we live in for these young kids all of us in some way shape or felt we had a little bit of entitlement the differences we've raised an entire generation with your\nThe past year the greatest you're all of this we've lawnmower parents mowed down everything in their path we've got people who've told their kids with the great things in the history of the world everybody gets a trophy my generation are little one time we knew we all didn't get a trophy\nRight genetics we knew that\nRight mom and dad might have thought you were great but they always reminded you that the world may not think your great it's different here you're micro aggressions with all of this stuff and I think the ... there is a there is a big gap between how an older generation has gone through stuff and a younger generation where even looking at somebody it's considered sexual assault\nIt it's going to be interesting to see how this plays out it really really is three two three five three twenty four twenty three at chat best in show is your Twitter we've got a whole areas [noise]\nStory about cheerleader speaking of young kids are and and and brownies we'll talk about that but first let's look at the economy more cameras bank rake dot com joined us we're going to talk about the economy and how well it's doing if it's doing well and who gets credit for that suggested you [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\nThinking about selling your home why pay tens of thousands of dollars and commission fees if you don't have to let me tell you about Farah a real estate company that's now here in Phoenix bills here come on tell us more\nThanks you know most people don't believe it but fair is actually free for sellers instead of paying six percent or so in your home for thousands below market value you keep your equity and not the most money when you sell with Farah we've already said home sellers over ten million dollars really harsh fair work\nI think there's every reason to be optimistic about basically the short end an intermediate terms\nI look at this and and I look at all of this across the board and I say to myself this looks this looks good this is so strong and then we get to the political side of things and I want you to listen to to what Don Lemon said the other night\nFrom some tread very carefully here because when it comes to the economy Trump got a lot of\nInherited a growing economy a growing economy inherited it\nFrom his predecessor jobs are being created at roughly the same average rate as under President Obama wages are growing at about the same rate they did under President Obama\nThe left is never going to get Trump credit and when I was listening to this the first thing that came to my mind is Michael Jordan had other coaches before Phil Jackson as did Kobe and Shaq but they never want any championships till he showed up\nA Trump you know the left is never going to give him credit but the reality is is\nYou know when is it going to be as economy uh and and it has he help the economy 'cause I think he absolutely has to help the economy not only from a point of how I think he's taken some of the shackles off and let it grow but I've also think he's on the economy on the confidence level which rarely gets talked about\n[noise] well a obviously a lot they're a very complicated a ...\nAnd I'm generally hesitant to try to get involved with a playing\nA well with either side when it comes to tribal politics 'cause I have very little patience for it but having said that to try to answer the question\nAh you know the buck stops here at a you know on Pennsylvania Avenue and so it is Trump's economy now and it will be for as long as he's an office and the same holds true for when President Obama was an office shore a you know the president the current president certainly had a gift but he did not come into office\nWhen Brock Obama came into office when you were losing seven hundred thousand jobs a month you know we were all working then and and a new the horror of that\nUh and the fact that we were able to piece all that together at least as well as was the case in some ways as a miracle because the economy nearly completely fell off a cliff back then\nUm but the president did one thing I think which has been key to energizing growth and that was to advocate for the tax cut\nOr some people think that the personal income tax cut was number one I'm not equitable with respect to benefiting all aspects of the population\nOr in other words at favorite the wealthy and people like Jamie diamond the C. E. O. J. P. Morgan Chase for these past fourteen years among others uh would say that he did not himself need a tax cut\nBut I think there's broad agreement that the piece that has to do with empowering business to do better on the world stage did need work and uh so I think the president and his Republican counterparts on Capitol Hill deserve\nUm the credit\nTo the extent that they did advocate for abroad a bit of tax relief a which is helping the economy probably for the next couple of years so there's I don't think there's an getting away from that\nTalking to mark hammered bank ... dot com as we discuss the economy and because we also just the one thing I started telling me that we all share and the economy I care what you say you're right laugh you not my president he's my president tribal politics all the stuff we all share and the economy we buy things we sell things we work we have homes and get things we've got to take care of\nRight now the market itself is the job market is good you're seeing more and more people feel confident enough to quit their jobs and ... and I always like when people say well you know the growth rate for for jobs as far as money is it what it was a lot of ways I tell everybody because very rarely do you get a raise your work a lot of times but you do is you jump across the street\nBecause they are willing to give you a race that your company is not going to match so there's a lot of that that I don't think it's added in when you look at this marketplace you look at the job place if you're somebody right now is this a great time for entrepreneur is is a great time to jump jobs is just a place where you feel like now is the time to strike\nWell I think you know first of all if you're operating in the United states of America and again in a political ... that it's a nationalistic comment as it turns out if you're operating in the usa you have the opportunity to do something that no one else in the world can do because we have\nYou can do because we have the widest deepest capital markets we have the greatest innovation in off the planet\nAnd that's why we continue to create companies that do things that really don't exist anywhere else so all large businesses used to be small businesses we know the legends about Steve Jobs and\nA Jeff Bezos be getting in their garages so they were small businesses to begin a there are some measures out there that suggests and there are a little controversial but there are some measures out there that\nSuggests that small business is growing as well as it used to\n'em and I'll just sort of\nLeave that there for the moment ah and there are some who are sharply critical of the growth of the likes of Facebook Google um Amazon the list goes on and on saying essentially a they are crippling tech entrepreneur ... by a centrally doing what Facebook did buy\nA essentially buying Instagram and then seems to be in the process of killing Snapchat so there you know those are all inevitably a questions that have as much to do with regulation as anything else but to the broader point I think it's All right now is a superb time to be looking for work to be starting a business\nAnd you know people always have challenges no matter what the point in our history they happen to be doing that you know if you people succeeded by building businesses in the midst of the depression for goodness sake and and the same can be said of in two thousand seven two thousand two thousand nine so\nIf somebody has low vision has a great idea and is willing to work hard\nAh the United states as a as a great place to do that as anywhere I think\nA man I Love having you on my man will do it again next month or more cameras demand with gold voice from fake re dot com have yourself a good weekend we'll talk to you soon\nYou're very kind to much always a pleasure to be like you\nActually had been some shows your Twitter C.

well ah the summary of the supplemental FBI investigation executive summary has come out the FBI spoken ten people and found note this just came out late last night no cooperation of the aisle\nRation of the allegations made by a two of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's accuser is according to an executive summary\nUh released a in fact it was early this morning it was released actually wasn't late last night according to this report\nThe request was for an investigation into the uh current credible allegations\nAgainst justice Kavanaugh reads the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage that the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation\nSo there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witness is with potential first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from a the ... lawyer said well no she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had\nFirst hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right and you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against capping off\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark judge Leyland ties are PJ a Smith\nA Timothy ... debt and Christopher Garrett the FBI investigators also spoke with\nA another attorney for one of the witnesses mark judge a close friend of Kavanaugh's\nOr was allegedly in the room when Ford was assaulted and Ford said it was judge jumping on her and Kavanaugh that allowed her to get away my Claude adding Garret who would tend to Georgetown Prep with judging Kavanaugh and their names appeared in the Nineteen eighty two calendar Kavanaugh discussed in his Senate Judiciary committee testimony\nFBI personnel also interviewed Deborah Ramirez who accused Kavanaugh\nOf a boom putting private parts in her face and forcing her to touch it\nAs she shoved him away while the two were undergraduates at Yale University relating to her marriage this allegation investigators interviewed to of some to suppose that eyewitnesses and close college friend upper mirror as a third suppose that I witnessed refused to speak to investigators\nParticipation in FBI background check interviews is voluntary the supplemental background investigation was ordered by uh the White House at the request a of the a committee\nOr forty six page report is what it was and uh as we now know none of those witnesses that supposedly had and they went through all the witnesses at that potentially had first hand knowledge mhm and\nNo cooperation to get the right and and that's again the [noise] when when you look at it\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change this gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all the long delayed delayed July\nWas the outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president withdraw the nomination and that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got\nThe the greater or I guess the stronger a the foot hold got by the president and of course the nominee himself\nThis was a tactic by the left to delayed this nothing more nothing less put this off\nAnd hope that you can uh appeal to either one party or the other other along the way uh whether it's Grassley or flake or anybody\nThat will help you delayed even further and that's over it is over\nI don't know what the vote looked like on Saturday Night or early Sunday Morning but it's going to happen\nCenter games from South Dakota said and and called a cabinet and said he\nWill be there for the vote yet he will vote or no matter what it takes for him to get back from his daughter's wedding on Saturday right now the vote could be anywhere from Saturday afternoon through late Saturday evening who knows him to Sunday Morning and I don't know at this point it a a ... after they have the official cloture vote\nIt will be a thirty our you know a clock ticking ... up for debate it could go less than thirty hours\nOr depending if the Democrats you know want to extend it right right now it looks like thirty hours\nYeah or if there's a lot of live t._v. coverage of it out which may or may not be I I don't know but\nMay not be I I don't know but on a Saturday on a cable news channel as a very decent chance at any of them were all of them will be covering it lived throughout the day\nBecause this is ... this is different than\nThe DNC and the Trump campaign pain Perkins Cooley who then paint fusion GPS the opposition research firm who then\nAre paid Christopher Steele to get the unbearable fight or false information from the Russians close to the the the uh the the Kremlin to destroy Donald Trump's campaign and then use that in a Pfizer\nWarren but also you had the personal lawyer for the DNC give to the general counsel at the FBI documents\nAbout Trump wow\nYeah\nThe FBI official who was contacted James Baker revealed the exchange to congressional investigators during a closed door\nDeposition Wednesday he said ... lawyer Michael assessment initiated contact with him\nAnd providing documents as well as computer storage devices on Russian hacking the sources said Baker described the contact as unusual and only the only time it happened Perkins going was a key player in the funding of the controversial anti Trump\nDossier which Republicans have long suspected helped\nFuel the FBI investigation the DNC and Clinton campaign had hired opposition research firm fusion GPS in April of twenty sixteen through ... to dig into Trump's background\nFusion intern paid X. British spy Christopher Steele the compiled a dusty a a mental from which were shared with the FBI in the summer of twenty seven twenty sixteen and we're used\nTo get the Pfizer warned against the Trump campaign\nWhich is a secret war ... ... contact with Baker suggest another connection between the early stages of the FBI's Russia probe and those working with the DNC and the Clinton campaign\nSo it's been spy on ... website describes them as a former senior Justice Department official with extensive national security and cyber security experience suspend is engaged or on some of the most sophisticated high stakes matters today\nSuch as his representation of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in their response to Russian hacking than the twenty sixteen presidential election remember they said it was the discussion was about\nTrump and his collusion with Russia and\nThat's what the discussion was about ... and documents were handed from this Perkins could we lawyer or to the former FBI official the general counsel and just weeks before the election and a short time before they got the Pfizer warned wow\n[noise]\nAnd finally\nDemocratic congressman a beta or weren't said he's not interested\nIn an endorsement excuse me state senators me\nWhat yeah\nWhile they're calling them congressman oh no no no no he's not a state senator he's a he's a congressman\nOh in a district in El Paso oh I don't know I'm thinking I don't want to take his place or\nA Democratic House and better work said he's not interested in endorsement from President Brock Obama is the attempt to unseat Ted Cruz in the mid term in\nIraq was speaking after a town hall at a local high school when addressed and he addressed the unsettling fact that Obama has endorsed eleven Texas Democrats not including himself I don't think we're interested he's setting the endorsement\nRight I'm so grateful for um for service is going to go down as one of the greatest presidents\nAnd yet this election is on Texas ...\nSo there you go well it it's again\nYou can take the money from the liberals outside of the state but you you cannot uh bring it in because here's what he knows a couple of things\n[laughter] uh\nMany people especially people in the middle in and on the right who are going to vote for him anyway but the the ones in the middle who just might\nOr would be many of them turned off by Obama but beyond that when you look at Obama and his effect on the left it doesn't hurt at all that'll Rourke turns them down what does that tell you about ... ...\nWhat does that tell you about Obama and his influence on the left\nAnd the fact that it doesn't matter you can publically say I don't want us endorsement right doesn't affect anybody\nAt all you know ... years they don't get a lot but the DNA is like now that that'll thinking about ten years ago right now but well think about going\nBack I don't know go back to um you know the post just after the Clinton years so go back to the mid term of two thousand to write and imagine someone said that then of a Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton you know wasn't the deity that Obama was\nBut\nStill in a situation like that back then that would have been done behind closed doors right if\nSomebody on the left was like yeah listen ah you know we're trying to just do this on our own uh you know you know maybe the the voters won't react positively to Bill Clinton being you know as a ... an endorsement on on the ticket\nNow you\nCan just open we say yeah we're we're ... we're over Obama\nWe don't need\nI mean really it's it is the major major he's yesterday's news desk but it's the major blue states\nWhere he gets applauded but the question is does he really happening usefulness to the party itself\nIf you think about the the like when he uh gave us a list of in endorsements remember who's back and when that came out mhm [noise] kind of like his bracket used to be but it really kind of have the same political impact as is actually I could say this his rocket used to get more new\n[noise] [laughter] right well on ESPN it did not know ... and ... culture and I know I don't get ... well yeah that that was a surprise for different reasons said yes it was yeah yeah yeah um [laughter] no you let's not get political by bringing ESPN and right and I I mean on it got huge news\nNo it was and and the endorsement list really I mean it came out and made his rounds but it really didn't go any further from that there hasn't been that presence\nYou know by Obama and that might be his choice I mean they've been saying what they hanging out I did see the stories here's what he's reading this summer nobody cares\nNo one cares I remember that story no one here's what's on his reading list for shows them you know on a on a couch you know somewhere probably in Martha's Vineyard no body cares but\nIt hasn't been the political impact and in that part is over I mean for the right it's kind of been that way for a while George W. Bush kind of went off and then he retired he really didn't say a lot\nAnd I have a question there's just popped into my mind you and me and you just made you just reignited the the flame and my brain ... ah Dershowitz mentioned uh Martha's Vineyard yesterday and buy something known as a liberal island yeah right are there any conservative islands\nAffects us [laughter] [laughter]\nNot exactly an island but [laughter] it's about as close as we can get or for conservatives go from all over the world to hang out together\nYou know there's a thing like because you know what does it and he said he's not welcome snow Dershowitz said he's not welcome on Martha's Vineyard I actually asked this question in my mind uh because a friend uh well actually someone in the house was watching something where there was um\nThere was this area and it was clear in this area it was all liberals they were it was part of reality t._v. show but the based on the things that people were saying and show it was clearly a liberal and I kinda thought thought of Martha's Vineyard because it kind of had that appeal looked like that right\nAnd that's thought to myself\nThere isn't a conservative place like that [laughter] and there really isn't I mean because\nI don't know I mean you don't I well we don't look for a safe spaces [laughter]\nNovels routed by water if let's say the same age [laughter] you really have to make an effort to get their Martha's\nVineyard the safe space for the elite liberal well there's the thing too it's only about the rich liberal some rich the rich elite liberal you right\nAll right I understand now yeah okay thank you I had to clarify that in my own mind right right of work that through 'cause after you brought it up and I heard Dershowitz you know there there was asked yesterday about yeah I go to Martha's Vineyard I Can't even associate with those people anymore I mean they they rejected me I'm like what you're talking about places like it's\nOne particular you know political bent\nNo political bent well yeah it is it conservative violent ah that because it's surrounded by water it's a safe space for the rich elite liberal right now and

I Hope I got a cute I read your\nTrial the false [noise]\nQuestions the rain [noise] than we should not long to wait another candidate\nThat what's that are Spartacus in Jersey [laughter]\nHuh Tucker Carlson that was the senator ... yeah I I just I was I was doing the ...\nOver Cory Booker what\nOh that's where he said doesn't matter whether is innocent or not there's been enough questions raised that he should drop out now [laughter] so if you just raise just throw up the allegations yeah and and there's one flight away the germs were later on and said he goes yeah I I Know what I\nSaid what do you think about it goes where we've been through this already McCarthy ... you're not a communist right exactly\nThat's exactly what the same thing that liberals were outraged about is not what they endorse\nExactly four on attracts user forecast\nUnusually persistent weather pattern is going to bring some snow to the higher elevations of the Rockies rain snow into the great lakes basin possible and into the northern plains\nSevere thunderstorms possible over parts of the country today in New York will see Seventy eight degrees with some sunshine today Detroit under thirty percent chance of showers five Seventy three Chicago near sixty eight chance of thunderstorms both today and tomorrow\nWhether frontal boundary lingering around the mid west we can certainly see the difference in temperatures in Chicago from today\nChicago from today's high sixty eight\nTo Monday eighty one degrees and there you have the chance for thunderstorms with a pretty good difference in temperature along that front Atlanta eighty six today Dallas eighty four with a chance of thunderstorms Denver around fifty three degrees overnight low going into Monday thirty six\nBut I agree with you that that process is worth preserving other liberals who feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused Norwood acted similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like and no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite\nWhat's happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think\nThe framers of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I have great yeah\nI ... and and that's it I mean we we talk about the process\nYou know it's it's telling\nThat we're at this point and still at this point in fact heightened your you'll likely see the chaos heightened today and tomorrow up until the main vote on late Saturday or\nEarly Sunday Morning whenever it happens\nBut we're at this point but it is all this chaos\nBefore the actual vote and what is it that that matters it's only about the vote I mean this is further proof that this was only about the delay delay it as long as you can in hopes\nAnd outside hope I guess that Kavanaugh would pull his own confirmation and withdraw his own confirmation and or the president would do it um that wasn't going to happen or the once once the left got loud that wasn't going to happen but this president\nAnd and now we know very clearly it certainly isn't going to happen by the nominee himself but\nYou look at this entire process and it has been distorted greatly there is no guarantee here that that Kavanaugh we will be confirmed with the actual legitimate process\nOf all of this in place well you know when you when you hear Dershowitz or talk about you know McCarthyism ... and and what happened at that time when\nYou know you someone who accuse you of being a communist and so you'd get enraged and they say well sorry you don't have the temperament the allegation itself meant you were blacklisted right the the the fact that you lost it at anything was used an a you know against you\nAre and I thought there's which you know really when he said he said it was so you've been a director forty years and now you're losing control because somebody's calling you were communist you're on the temperament for the job so you're out your blacklisted from the the ... you know from the industry and it's something that liberals used to have in their mind and I think the important thing is\nAnd it's obvious because you and I have been having this discussion a back and forth because it is the left it is you know antifa anti pies we call it this supposed to be anti fascist\nYet what are they promote what is their actual mindset it's authoritarianism and its fascism it's it you must live the life that that that we that that we wish you to live\nAnd what you see here what you see here from the Democrats the mindset that they're promoting everybody that you see Michael Moore and Amy Schumer and whoever whatever Hollywood people are down there screaming and yelling about you know a Brett Brett Kavanaugh and believe the accuser\nThat the the the defendant has no rights at all the defendant is automatically guilty that is the mindset of a fascist yes that's not the mindset of somebody who\nBelieves in the American constitution and the spirit of America and the spirit of due process in the spirit of the bill of rights\nOf the United states it is the mindset of a fashion\nWell and and what we call somebody when we say they have the mindset of the fascist we back it up with the specifics not just oh he talks mean therefore he's a fascist know whatever's exact words and what does he actually wish to implement when we talk about President Trump\nAnd you know they started on that uh and now they've\nMoved on and this is a very very important thing for people to understand that I think that's what this is what maybe you're not in the Republican Party it started with Trump and enough people hate the Trump where it stuck for a while\nAnd then they decided to move on from Trump and they moved on to Kavanaugh and all of a sudden the realization as we've said all along it was a bogus argument completely bogus and lies against Trump to begin with but then they moved to somebody else\nWho more people look at and say when all this is somebody who really really like this is somebody who we really would like in that position as much as we don't like Trump\nThis was a great great great great pick and then you see the same tactics used against Trump that might have been okay for some people because they despise them so much somehow hit somebody they like and then they realized\nOh no if it can hit him that it can hit him oh my God they can come after me next thing go after anybody and that's what you learn with the fascists mindset they'll pick out an attractive target to get people\nYou know motivated behind them even people of you know well of goodwill\nAnd all of a sudden those people have good will wake up one day and say and sometimes I wake up in a society and it's too late\nIt's not too late here in the United states and it's not too late in this instance and it looks like that because people have fought back\nAre you now have you know created this unity in the Republican Party but remember it only goes so far because people of good will buy into it at times yes because it fits their political narrative but it is the mind what you're seeing is the mindset of a fascist\nAnd the fascist in this case is not the Republicans it is the Democrats and it's not debatable\nWell I mean it's very simple when you look at the group that says they're anti fascist and their name in fact has condensed down to those condense from those two words\nThere the group that's willing to go out and hurt people use violence against people they disagree with\nPunish people for thought they're the ones who are acting on it they're the ones in California who create laws that if you don't talk the way we want you to talk we can send you to jail\nAnd New York we can find your business to the extent that you will be out of this\n\nTell me that's not fascist you you don't create the ours that somebody wishes you to create we will destroy your business\nYou wear a hat you go to a restaurant and try and have a peaceful dinner we will come on to that private property and we will shout you out\nYou think like us you behave like gosh you reject the bill of rights and if you don't we will destroy your life\n\nRepublicans are finally coming around and you're not in ... oh my God\nThat's what that party has become and it's not the fringe this is the important thing that this is not the fringe this is the main stream yeah this is the Senate Judiciary committee it's the mainstream power of the republic or some of the Democratic party\nAnd you have a vaccine waters who doesn't get any grief from the left for saying this is what we need you to do this is what we want you to do go out and get in their face every chance you get\nAnd all of a sudden you've got pushed back yeah right because the average American will put up or for a while until all of a sudden it's like whoa okay the lines been crossed and I believe many people believe\nNow that this line has been crossed I Hope they do let me put it this way I'm not going to make the prediction that they have yet it seems that they have\nBut my hope is that the American people have had enough yeah and that more people will start rejecting\nThe the mindset of fascism that is being promoted by the mainstream of the Democratic party yeah as we're always say tell us where we're wrong\nYou can't eight six six Ninety ...\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have consistent molecular restructure giving it the

this morning about the neighborhood I grew up in and you know\nAs you get older you don't remember the bad stuff all your does remember the good stuff and so it's very ideal like in your mind that it wasn't all day like neighborhood it was incredible is full of kids\nAnd we were always doing something you ever get a ... a piece of plywood out and put a couple of bricks up under it and go across it on your bike like evil can evil you were jumping and it didn't go well and you go over the handlebars I mean have you ever done stuff like that and we'd anymore no much\nI mean we play baseball we play football we spent a lot of time arguing about the call 'cause we wait we'd always argue about whether somebody is out of bounds we played and played and played and played and played run in and out of each other's houses and one mom always have some lemonade one mom would always have some\nBaloney sandwiches I mean it was a great neighborhood\nAnd I remember being a little kid and some of the kids I played with started going to school I thought man I Want to go to school you know be cool to go to school when I can go to school\nI'll be happy than you ever thought that and and then I got to go to kindergarten and I thought man next year I'll be in a grade with a number on it I'll be happy then they teach you to read in the first grade I'll be happy then\nAnd when back when I went to school and I don't know where you go to school but I mean we had one through six was elementary school and and so you know you're about a second grader and all the sixth graders there the king of the hill right they own the school right\nAnd so you're like man\nI could just get in the sixth grade I'd be like the big dog on campus I'd be in charge I'd be though I'd be ruin the school man\nI'll be happy then\nThen you finally get the sixth grade and you know what you look over there and we had what we called junior high school or middle school which was\nSeven eight nine the school I went to\nAnd I thought man\nIf I could just get out of six gringo over there and middle school you know they've got\nI got the they've got football that got cheerleaders cheerleaders that guy lockers man I if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that\nSaid I'm wanting to fall thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nA few years ago how are we sign or shouted out for Florida prepaid college planned and my husband and I were both making more money at a time and fence than our income has gone down and we added another child\nAnd we've gotten into our credit card debt and

learning in financial ... and just work your baby steps if you stop adding to what you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a norm urgency or no rush but sometime in the ...\nMoney\n\nIs she\nA no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out right of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent show that'd be nice rate of return right so how much of an increase in price 'cause that's the only returned when you\nSay anything he approached right\nThey're not giving your growth rate you you're saving the increases in tuition by paying it

[laughter]\n\n\nI Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew's with us in Fort Worth Texas have Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a a ... I was going through a few for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ... to my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing to happen\nOr we were at my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas ... a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a ... ... a speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money [laughter]\nOr over a million dollars [laughter] and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or\nHopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom mhm and we want him out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one reason west Texas is struggling run our oil prices are so far down that there's no boom\nOkay I mean when gas for five dollars a gallon it was a boom by being I mean but are you doing and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on\nYou know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue all of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all to get just about everything I Know just in a [laughter] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more ah oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all into an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none uh what do you it's it's essentially a they're looking at a three million for all the and or or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you're just added on how one yeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think I don't think I'm asking is women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling our house\nThat we're deciding on how much to sell\n... ... if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it would I go by oil rights with it my answer would quickly be no mainly\nBecause I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it\nThat I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable in less risk personally okay but that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars piled in the middle kitchen table would I go go by what rights in West Texas with it if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I think you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that\nYou know what we're afraid the stock market crash yeah\nWell it might but I got to tell you start getting less rock markets less risk\nThan drilling holes yeah we're a hundred\nPercent error that you don't ... I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all persons to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just felt like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping or my mother and father ... oh I see\nSo it's a just shut down there they can make the decision for the whole thing or not\nLeast shell Seventy five percent\nOf it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you\nKnow if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advise that have families entire portfolio three million dollar network\nUp in ...
