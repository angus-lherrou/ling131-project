throw in and help her out a little bit but mentioned lives in a weird world where he's in West Virginia a solid dead red state\nWhere he's a Democrat and he's gone against the Democrats on numerous

at some point in time he may look at you and go you know what I'm going to start just I'm going to be a Republican or an independent but he is a Democrat in a state that is\nIs dead read and you know so each one of these senators that sway this thing today each one of them was in a situation where their their situation is extremely unique because\nThere for some of them they're they're in places where there you know outside of their little area there's not a a lot of friendliness going on meaning the Republicans and Democrats states are Democrats and Republican states\nAnd they did what they thought they had to do and I looked at the way that Collins approach this today she approached it in a way that had zero very little\nTo do with the salacious ... other than scolding some people on

everybody to know how important\nThis thing was set up as the opposite hunger advances nomination\nEvery one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes\nAnd the set up that he said that on record saying and that's vitally important because some of these people that were going up against others and going in different directions you'd be surprised or some people are going to

urban word of the day\nIt's half of the urban word of the day I Am\nNow time to get a little more ... on the street talking understand a word you're saying\nOh kids I Love this one of those things are going well ladies you you you might know a lot about this you can go out on a date with somebody and they're saying they're self employed a lot of times what that means especially in certain generations is [noise]\nYou're unemployed you're just trying to survive and you're hustling and ... yeah I'm self employed I'm an entrepreneur oh you don't have a job that is correct [laughter]\nSelf employed ...\nUnemployed is your urban word of the day thank you for say ... or even going about our understanding that there were ... urban were other day we damn stress shore cranium\nThe unemployment rate's actually the lowest ... fault or what was great we've seen since Nineteen sixty nine so I think that that sort of confirms but it'd be other numbers we're seeing right now and that is that the economy is actually really healthy at the moment\nYes kind of me as healthy it feels healthy people I talk to\nTalk about you know what that this just it feels like it's motoring along don't get me wrong we're going to have a slow down and hopefully it's not another crash I don't think it will be but the way we're spending and borrowing you never know but the ... this economy feels good and heading into a fourth quarter\nThat is huge and I think this year we're gonna have a massive force quarter and it is a it is it is the confidence is there\nPeople are looking for jobs don't have to worry they're finding jobs and people are having the opportunity to do essentially ghost jobs they're getting job offers and they're thinking this sounds good and then five minutes later they get another job offer it is it feels like a real best robust solid economy right now and and that's a lot of people\nThat that that matters it does three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some show\nIs your Twitter let's switch gears for a moment something I find very interesting I ... you know basketball\nStarting NCA guys are starting to get ready for theirs and it is a crazy disgusting were we talking about politics let me tell you about NCAA Basketball how weird as Michael ... new book out called the last temptation of a Rick Pitino\nIs very interesting very interesting the championship [noise]\nShack censorship [noise]\nSleep plays a super important\nImportant a role in your physical health sleep is involved in healing in repairing of your heart and blood vessels ongoing sleep deficiency is linked to an increased risk of heart disease kidney disease high blood pressure diabetes and stroke\nThat's according to the national heart lung and blood Institute when I found my pillow and started staying asleep longer and sleeping more deeply I vowed I Will never use another pillow\nWell he was although you know one of the interesting things is and that\nPitino wasn't the best recruiter he wasn't getting all the best players um you know to his credit\nHe achieved final four is a national championships with guys who weren't lottery picked she wasn't getting the players coach K was getting or or um Calif Perry or bells bill self at Kansas um\nBut uh he apparently wanted one of the air with with Brian bow and junior and ah didn't play the game quite clever enough\nTalking about the game and and this is very interesting and for those people out there I'm again college more as we look at and we think oh it's it's it is if you're just kind of like the Olympics the reality is there's so much money there's billions and billions of dollars in it and one of the places that billions of dollars comes from is the athletic side of the Nike or Adidas\nThe Under Armour the and one because these kids they go out to recruit them at young ages you who you going to play for which AU team but you're going to the NIH can't be going to the ... camp it's vitally important and then a lot of ways they'll try to follow you to certain schools that are you know that have contracts\nThat is what happened here you know\nUh I think a lot of fans think well they want to put shoes on kids in eighth grade or because they think that you know they they might be an end and this kid might be an NBA player and he's going to be a Nike a endorse or when it gets the NBA\nThat's a small part of the center of what they really want to do what it does Nike and Under Armour largely want to do is funnel kids\nTo the schools they sponsor and then they are human billboards you know within this amateur sport they are human billboards for whichever apparel they're wearing\nAnd that is one of the most cynical things so Louisville signed a to sign a hundred and sixty million dollar contract with the ... and all these kids are wearing Adidas stuff from the bookstore by the way you can barely find a book you know after you you know after you get through all the details gear and that's true\nYou know at Ohio State with Nike or Under Armour at at UCLA where the former football coach said now everybody's going nowhere big time because we got this huge contract from Under Armour and it was like really\nYou have seven Nobel Prize winners who came through UCLA you had John Wooden and it takes being associated with them Under Armour to be the time so everything is sort of turned upside down by the money and by the commercial partnerships with a shoe companies\nTalking to Michael ... love and his new book which is amazing less than ... Rick Pitino story of corruption scandal and the big business of college basketball\nYou know now we've got betting we've got all of this stuff money huge March Madness the whole nine yards we always wink wink nudge nudge Israel played the pools and played the brackets and stuff\nI think this is going to affect the this moving forward because the NCAA's holding on for all they possibly can as far as their you know hey we're just amateurs their student athletes they get a free college ride but they see the money's at the coaches make that the NCAA makes and now you've got betting and how's that going to play into this\nWell the betting is just going to make it to ever bigger\nUm you know the the kids who play these games generate money in ways we don't even think of the recruiting sites you know rivals dot com and ah you know whatever bleacher report runs and I can't remember all the names of them but they're all these\nUh betting all these recruiting sites that that run on\nFocusing on the decisions being made by Seventeen year olds well you know what these are big businesses the the the several of them have been bought or sold emerged in the last few years for like three hundred four hundred million dollars at least so\nYou've got that you've got you know all the hotels and restaurants that benefit you know that are sitting outside the stadiums\nAnd now you're going to have legalized betting which means more betting and that's off the sweat and the muscle of the kids were playing the game so it just well multiply the inequality that we have now and it's really intolerable you know you can't say after a while\nYou were giving you a thirty thousand dollar a year scholarship\nGuess what you're generating forty five million dollars in annual revenue at the University of Louisville ah which was the highest\nAh which was the highest of any of the schools but you know tens of millions everywhere\nYou look I ... and that's the that's the thing that's insane is how much money and I don't look I mean like this past weekend I watch Alabama destroyed the raging Cajun south Louisiana Tech or whatever was in football they're going to get their million dollar jak and that'll pay for the rest of their football season I understand it that it's a business\nAnd and that's that that's fine I got zero problems with that\nUh I just but I don't like is disingenuous by the NCAA that saying that hey this is this is not really business is all about amateur athletics when when you and I both know BS and the reality is the FBI had to look in this because the NCAA didn't want this stuff uncovered because they're they looked like they have egg on their face because they're allowing this stuff to go on right under their nose\nThat is all absolutely right I mean it was all a smog sort of fantasy that that these are amateur so that I Will tell you that if you look at the FBI charging documents on the indictments the FBI comes off as pretty naive because their whole case is\nSort of positive on the the FBI has uncovered a this these ... this wrongdoing and these characters who they have indicted were violating the spirit of of amateur ism and and you know letting these in these players be\nCommercially exploited\nAnd I'm thinking well okay but\nThe NC double a itself is is it commercially exploitive organization that didn't take\nA Christian Dawkins or was it was one of those charger or these with these characters to exploit them they're they're signing up for that basically 'cause that's the way the system is\nYou know the ... thing is as always interest me because you'll hear about these guys and if those are you don't know it is it is it is we don't find basketball players playing high school basketball anymore what travel team are you under the age you and some of those guys\nGenerate massive amounts of money they're making quarter million dollars coaching AAU basketball and some of them end up getting jobs these colleges if they bring the right kids with them and I think it's not just a college you know or an NCA thing I think that it it goes much deeper that I don't think people realize that\nWell that's that's a big word of this problem the the grassroots circuit which is funded by the shoe companies and kids\nMay play high school basketball but the hunting ground the recruiting ground is the ... circuit and college coaches love at first of all they're getting money from the shoe companies but it also means instead of and this was not even ... brilliant ... was\nThe man at Nike who brought Michael Jordan to Nike and and pretty much designed the system I'm\nToward sunny understood as college coaches don't like going to high school games and getting on a plane and going to Dubuque, Iowa or wherever\nAnd seeing some six eight prospect compete against the uh five ten kid who is covering him so let's put together something we're number one all the best players are playing against each other\nAnd just as importantly let's put it in Las Vegas and our land or when let's let's put it in places where these college coaches can come and stay in five star hotels and eat great dinners at night uh so that's what you've got now so part of the unwinding of this whole system\nIf you really wanted to do it would be to fend college coaches back to the small towns and high school gems and believe me they don't want to do it\nWhat what what what's the solution here going I must solutions based guy I I think at some point in time ... you've got to throw your hands up and say look this is the system we've got we've got to figure out a way to\nTo do you do not so much keep it in and keep a disguise but let's just be transparent about it and figure out the best way of dealing with it but going forward what do you think the best solution is is it is it that\nNo more one in ... those kinds of things would that takes some of that out of it just either you're going to the NBA you're going to college for two or three years how do we work around this\nWell the number one and done which I think it's coming only takes\nThe top ten or twelve kids out of this equation or they can go right to the NBA so that does a little but it doesn't do much uh the solution is to cut the kids\nIn this in to a significant part of the revenue which means not we're going to take your stipend up from three thousand ten thousand it means we're really going to pay you were going to figure out a way to pay you and\nThere's some people in the un ca who who don't want to do that I think there are some who do want to do it and legitimately can't figure out how and I and I get that because there are title nine problems you know they only they talk about revenues sports you're really talking about profit sports and that's men's basketball and college football\nSo can you pay them and not pay the women athletes is that right is it fair I really don't know they have they have to deal with that and then if you start paying people what if your quarterback who you\nWho you know paid as a freshman and sophomore where he starts thrown interceptions and and somebody somebody Texas job you're cut his pay you're going to fire him\nOr are you going to pay your star point guard on the basketball team more than the scholarship kid who's who's like the night for the player on the team these are all the things that you would have to deal with and they're not easy\nI think they're legitimately not easy and I think as much as a lack of a will to to cut kids and there's there's a lack of of a real understanding of how it might be done but I there's got to be a way to do it and I think they have to do it\nLeading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become

set up on background check\nOn background checks but that was passed by the majority Democrat congressman or excuse me sent it back in two thousand nine as part of the Senate yeah they\nCannot ah that cannot take pictures or make copies for themselves or anything else again they can make notes for the discussion to be had but those notes will be secured and even possibly destroyed in the same way the documents would be [noise] ah I Want to play this audio\nCut here uh yesterday a it was Alan Dershowitz ... to hear him speak on it now Alan Dershowitz not a fan of Donald\nTrump right they're not a liberal liberal liberal not a fan of Donald Trump or whatsoever we we've just done before when it comes to\nA variety of legal issues are out there everything from the going all the way back to the travel ban which right of center ... what does the constitution say forget about your partisanship what does the constitution say what are the separation of powers\nOr we find that even though we disagree on the day to day issues uh with Dershowitz all I agree mostly with his interpretation of the constitution\nYeah and and that's what you know one of the\nThis is one of the problems uh you know Alan Dershowitz is older than we are ... so he's an old school Democrat mhm he may have his opinions of what he wants day to day onto you know what we should do with immigration or or how far a welfare should go or what taxes should be\nBut I'm the constitution there used to be agreement between\nLiberals and conservatives on how they view the constitution that's one big difference that we have today and that's why you have somebody like Dershowitz who is now openly ostracized by the liberals the whole thing that he [noise]\nWhere they can make you know their own decision\nI don't know what's going to delay it any longer because but because I think right now I think you have even the proper administration I think they probably agree with what Lindsey Graham said that we said before Lindsey Graham setting which was time to go have the vote and even if you get onto the feet you make it an election issue\nYou make it a huge election issue you make it the only election issue as to fall far Democrats are going to go you've seen the resurgence we brought you the NPR poll the resurgence of just over the last couple of weeks\nThe a Republican excitement level to go out and vote you make it an election issue and when you take the Senate again maybe even with more members of the Senate you'd do it again\nOr early voting starting what in a couple of weeks\nAnd many places it's not far it's just that it's just days away\nSo keep in mind a lot of if you've got conservatives conservatives are big on early voting or especially with something like this if they're motivated there right now chomping at the bit\nWanting to get out and and have their voice heard uh I'm I'm curious to see where that early voting turnout is or what it's going to look like but I I suspect it will be

Trump we're all deplorable now right and and uh you don't make a great point in the never conservatives are the left by the way that it doesn't matter it's got nothing to do with Trump this has nothing to do with Trump\nAnd and we have talked about how this has United the ... the Republican parties and the different factions and even the never Trump hers and it has it has helped to unite them\nBack to coming home to the Republican Party and a couple of things that they wrote here they said Democrats were so worried about the Senate norms that they hid Mrs Ford's name from Republicans for six weeks found or a lawyer midwife the lie detector test who's results they still haven't fully disclosed and an orchestrated the ... uh accusations\nMr Trump's rhetoric is too often divisive in this assembling but no action in his presidency\nComes close to matching the hardest and viciousness of the Senate ambush of Brett Kavanaugh\nThese are today's democratic norms and\nUh it's it's a media sometimes for us to be puzzled that more than eighty percent of Republicans across the country tell pollsters they support Mr Trump despite his personal applause\nThe never conservatives which is a left or the reason\nAnd the assault on judge Kavanaugh is the latest showcase of their message methods Republicans have figured out that if the left can willfully even gleefully destroy a man\nAs distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power sure Republicans are well aware of Mr Trump's excesses and false woods but they have also come to understand that the resistance to him is not rooted in principle\nOr some August call to superior character they know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen despite her history of deceit\nVoters know this is about the less will to power by any means necessary Republicans across America can see and certainly there are senators voting on judge Kavanaugh should realize that the left hates them as much or more\nThan they load Mr Trump conservatives understand that\nAnd for the American left they're all deplorable ... yeah I think that's it I think it's a great piece and right on target which is why you see I think more of a United front much more uh more United front than I can remember with Republicans in a long long time\nA ... here and it's more than just about this it is about the fact that they now understand how far the less we'll go what the left is about\nLeft is about ... and that's it and and this is not something you usually forget there's what another five week or less than five weeks now before the election\n[laughter]\nSo we are to blame for nothing but important people weren't listening [laughter] well we're the only that were to blame for this country is right now [laughter] I always said our listeners are the most important people on the planet and and they are\nI'm Talking about the non politicians [laughter] All right and and the other the other breaking news and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of years\nA this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a you know well\nHi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon or has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney from Perkins Cooley the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats did a ... used you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time was and nobody disputes what I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign\nGave money to their law firm ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin which was unverified still to this day unverified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it\nTo destroy the legitimacy of his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that ... from what we know it was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd so now we know that right before that the FBI lead counsel met with the law firm Perkins ...\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign [laughter] we got to the law firm they were well the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers\nRight and I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others and that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalized that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would\nWhy would the counsel for the FBI do they say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was lawyers\nMeeting with lawyers right why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay\nResearch firm fusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed or by both testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation\nJoint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the Pfizer court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump painting British Intelligence officer\nTo hide the Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to the votes of testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between\nThe ... law firm and the FBI we've often stated that said I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah you\nCan do a couple of season though you could do probably more seasons in law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've\nAlways broken down and since we've been on it for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this and when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians\nTo hack and or changed because of change than to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today yes\nAnd oh by the way if it's on verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's fall after that I've ever over after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was destroyed the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states and they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and just well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they don't make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that as\nIt tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith\nSomething go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still\nRelevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhere do you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right the longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know ... right or a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a note cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere ... and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth of what we have seen them but the Democrats did would die and Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret\nYes\nThat we know how background checks\nWe know how background checks for gun yet and they keep it ... they could have kept her name secret and we know the process they could have done it and she chose not to and Feinstein made this

and uh in two thousand nine it was the Democratic controlled Senate that came up with the protocol and this new rule that what you learn in a background check stays private\nYes it is going to be known only to the senators and and the idea is that ah I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check has done for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the military uh and and maybe you have a I so I Know someone who's who who had both parents were immigrants\nAnd so there was a that there was a a a special kind of background check okay we're going to look into basically a who you are as an individual and your family and everything else the point being is that they're there to vet you okay and

think we can all agree on that [laughter]\nHe didn't use real chalk but the the whole idea is that someone's going to make a claim the reason the FBI is part of it is because they have the resources in order and the training in order to substantially\nYou have claims when they do so on a criminal investigation they for the most part get it right but they had the point being they have the resources muttering to get that done\nThat's why you do that that's part of the process but there could be a claim let's just say one that's not backed up by any witnesses from something that happened decades ago about a nominee\nAnd getting that done if they believe they've got those votes\nEven at fifty because the veep can be fifty one the tie breaker\nThen they're going to move on it the the

something those numbers or we don't make predictions but certainly you look at the polls and we want to look at those false I think especially after from Thursday last Thursday on uh the Kavanaugh hearings couple of things I Want to\nBriefly touched on coming up on the bottom of the hour Saudi Arabia his increase or crude production why\n... is from Bloomberg Trump Mm yeah\nSt you better do it you want military stuff you'd better do it more on the way for on attracts here's your forecast\nStarted the week with heavy rain in the desert southwest that has cleared out the problem area now for potential flash flooding heavy amounts of rain and maybe even some local severe weather today including high winds hail and some locally produced thunder\nFully produced thunderstorms and tornadoes it's the central mid west\nSections of central Kansas into eastern Iowa far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin we can even include the Detroit area under a wide swath of heavy rainfall potential today the north east mid Atlantic\nWhenever they say I just want to throw it right out going on over there are quote unquote ... go call me and they're not but right 'cause they're just you're using the term but he destroyed that term rabbits like\nThe uh the the whole uh Brian Regan does a as a comedian my favorite I think people know that if they listen for any amount of time does a bit about the no nonsense judge\nBut what does a nonsense judge look [laughter] I mean it is Brian does a much better than I Do and and but that's the point I mean over the years we've her well that's a no nonsense judge\nOn a total nonsense judge okay we're breaking for ice cream [laughter]\nIt in other news of this from the hill dot com this was breaking news yesterday afternoon and the yesterday evening congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official this is from the hill and John Solomon congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign and\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met\nDuring the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThat's the term used by the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign to secretly pay the research firm fusion GPS who then paid the former British spy Christopher Steele compiled the dos Ga\nOf uncorroborated man whenever we talk about the left it's always on cooperating cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump\nAnd Moscow where colluding to hijack\nThe presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a bite testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation of Republicans on the house just jury and government oversight committee the sources told a John Solomon\nOr the other thing is the Baker was interviewed just yesterday by lawmakers behind closed doors Wednesday and sources declined to divulge the testimony other other than to say it confirmed\nOther evidence about the contact between Perkins ... law firm\nAnd the FBI the sources also said bakers interview broke new ground above the FBI's use of news media\nIn twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen to further the Trump case and about deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein ... conversations in spring of twenty Seventeen regarding possible use of the body while you're to record Trump\nThe interview was one of the most productive\nWe've had and it opened up many new investigative leads one source said\nAnother said Baker could not answer some questions the FBI about FBI media contacts citing ongoing investigation\nBy the Justice Department inspector general into alleged illegal leaks during and after the election about the Trump collusion probe and other matters these revelations illustrate\nA new how much the FBI and Justice Department had withheld from the public about their collaboration in collusion with clearly partisan elements of the Clinton campaign the DNC fusion GPS and steel that we're trying to defeat Trump\nAnd so that is you know breaking news because what you have there you have you have the first person from the last administration the Obama administration\nThat worked in the FBI you have them now on the record yeah according to John Solomon test to find the tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured worn right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked it they talk to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why why would that be why would that be\nSo that she was breaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days of the news want to get in Saudi Arabia has been ...\nIn Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to an air record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices there's some Bloomberg now\nOver ... largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again\nTo pressure from Trump now we talked about this 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are\nThe leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat started we'd be ... every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well\nAnd and you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comment that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion as you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that's exactly what will start seeing more and more\nThan I'd give I'd give credit here to President Trump yet where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me we're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we ... we're we're there for you all the time mhm ah and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and could convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member I deal pact member [laughter] very held back in the field pack member right Saudi Arabia or to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we've talked about when he does extremely good things we've talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrat there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um whatever wealth stops what could be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement ... and we had said look we said this long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] ... babies\nI'm One of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one of one of the reasons that we can certainly said look eventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ...\nOr ... who's a leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing yet in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA mhm\nOnly significant concession was on automobiles and parks rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers\nAnd potential terrorists if its exports to the U.S exceed two point six million vehicle that even though there is a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower price models now assembled by Volkswagen miles to in a few other manufacturers in Mexico\nMay no longer qualify for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariffs and it will hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments a they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with South Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close\nReaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by it and it's subtle along a we there's been a lot of us\nYou know industry that has suffered because of this and you wonder if you wind up basically but the same deal or things that you claim are great things that can't be enforced or as we said the other things that hurt the economy and will hurt lower income

William ... Sherman and we remember their names and their contributions to this day\nThere are a number of other patriots who fought and just as hard and were every bit as ... as the men we remember but who are all but forgotten in history\nHundreds of women yes women from both sides risk their lives fighting for their beliefs but none is memorialized ...\nAnd his memorialize my name is Karen Abbott decided it was time to change that her book ... ... soldiers spy tells the story for them to union and two Confederate who you strengths imagination and intellect to help their side\nBut why is it taking so long to bring them to the public's attention we're was Ken Burns and all this\nActually to be fair to Ken Burns he does mentioned one of them and his aspect of a war documentary road there Neal greenhouse who of course the famous Confederate spy but I think the answer to that is you know women weren't the ones writing the history books and history is written by men and about men\nAnd you know it was sort of on and and a pleasure to try to get the woman that do the end of the credit they deserve now\nAdded mentioned rose new green a widow who spied for the south despite her personal loss sadness and anger\nShe was in a very interesting and difficult position when the war broke out in the years leading up to the war she had lost five children and for years\nShe had lost her husband and a freak accident and he had lost her access to the White House this was somebody who would have had for Twenty years very close relationships with many democratic politicians she was even an adviser to president James Buchanan so she lost all of this when Lincoln was elected and the Republicans came into power and she was desperate to get this back\nSo when the Confederate cat that approaches her in the spring of Eighteen sixty one and asks her to operate and form a Confederate firing in the Washington DC the union capital\nShe disregard the danger of fat and jumped at the chance and you know goes ought to get a cipher and delivered some very important information to the Confederate Army and make quite a name for herself\nNot only was greenhouse why she was what we would call today a spy master\nOne of my favorite addict that it's in the book is on the eve of the first battle of Bull Run she summons one of her carriers and she had assembled quite a team of couriers as you said\nAnd one of them as a sixteen year old girl by the name of ... and she ties up a secret dispatch and Betty's hair and rolls it up into a bond\nAnd tells her just to go across the lines and to write to Confederate headquarters and deliver this message and and but he does exactly that\nAnd let's down her hair and this you know romantic traumatic fashion and hand over the snow and the note of course contains important information for the Confederate ... on the first battle of Bull Run and Rosa you know assembled her team and and kept on buying after that\nGreenhouse a Confederate by living in a federal capital had a counterpart Elizabeth then Lu for the union\nShe was a very shrewd I think she was probably the smartest the most effective spy of all of them\nShe was sort of a direct opposite of Ruth green how rose was you know of course the Confederate spy living in a federal capital and Elizabeth was again it's by living in the Confederate capital and whereas rose was brazen and outspoken and very bold about what she was doing of Elizabeth was quiet and death didn't and very discreet\nAnd she I think our biggest accomplishment was placing a former family slave and the Confederate White House\nAnd have it says that he was the stereotyping of slave wages illiterate and unsophisticated that Japan Lou insert her meat into the heart of the confederacy and steal some very important secrets\nMarina Davis the first lady of the confederacy made his announcement that she needed help he needed the staff the Confederate White House and does anybody have suitable serving she could borrow\nSo Elizabeth here's this and pays a social called of arena and says well I have somebody for you I have a girl you know she's not too bright and she stumbles in the kitchen but she should serve your purpose is fine\nAnd so she sends over a former family slave by the name of Mary Jane ... and of course nobody knows that Mary ... is not only literate but highly educated and gifted with a photographic memory\nSo off he's dusting Jefferson Davis his desk and cleaning up the children's toys she's also managing to sneak peaks at maps and fortifications and letters on his desk and eavesdropping on confidential conversations and of course reporting all this back to ...\nDell boy was a Confederate spy who is credited with supplying important information to Stonewall Jackson during the war ... boy was glued to the most southern belles at the time and wasn't afraid to shoot first ask questions later\nWas so interesting to me first of all she was only Seventeen years old when the war broke out she's all it it you know she had no filter and she was really incredibly over with both her opinions on her sexuality for the time period and for only being Seventeen years old\nBut I like to say if if you know Sarah Palin and Miley Cyrus had uh nineteenth century baby it would have been Bellboy she just was really out there on all fronts\nAnd she kicks things often in July of Eighteen sixty one she's living in Shenandoah Valley Virginia and union forces are marching down and they're planning to have a big fourth of July parade in her home town and bell is waiting for them and she's waiting for them with a pistol by her side and so when one of these union soldiers threatens to raise a flag\nFor her home a federal flag she objects to this and the size to shoot this fellow dead and she gets away with it and goes on to become a courier in spy for the Confederate Army and has quite a few adventures in the war\nFinally added profiles a real female
