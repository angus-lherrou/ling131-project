cuts and privatization\nImpoverished president may develop in one of the world's richest [laughter]\nYeah they finally said okay we had enough got\nTo take this the way this is it's counterproductive right all these people want all this stuff and the problem is is it's just not working so let's let's was privatized stuff a lot of stuff and we'll we'll we'll go free market and remember when I talk about somebody like across the court is the most in what's thought\nShe just she's an aberration for for ...\nShe is she's an aberration and I'm going to say this is getting sex is horrible she kind of pretty people in front of the cameras and and they like to talk to her because they know what she's going to say insane and the main things were last week she compared the global warming to Nazi is ... and all I mean she's going to stay stuff that's wacky people like she's ... she's not\nShe's not she's young to get there maybe one day she'll have an waking maybe she gets welcomed goes yeah a lot of stuff I was back then was full of crap\nBut here's the thing people like Bernie was a guy who enjoy Juba long before we got a little for the\nFriendly with Cuba enjoyed the Soviet Union looked at their model wanted to understand it like those kind of stuff wants government to be the center of everything and and knowing full well that we're still a capitalistic nation and even a lot of people in the left to like it don't take away our capitalism wants to look at a situation where they can come in and not be Venezuela\nBy nationalizing everything but having the government be over everything is kind of their dream no sweetened for all intents and purposes and this is more the check comes in for everybody's going to start sending me stuff here's your here's your check right you can check your privilege right here how free are they\nAll airs Sweden and the socialist paradise we do have a bigger well first faith in the U.S higher taxes than the ... but in other areas or when it comes to free markets when it comes to competition when it comes to free trade Sweden is actually more free market fat free market pays for Sweden's big welfare programs\nToday our time pay for you vote in Social Security\nFor Eighteen months pay rent movies government paid childcare for working families\nThey paid for a lot of those things right it does it pays for a lot of those things and those are things we can discuss your problem discussing some of those things you're not going to get Eighteen months off it's just not going to have you know that I Know and and here's the thing\nIn a world where we're going a thousand miles an hour I don't think too many people want to stop them take Eighteen months off their career that's that that's the reality some people do some people don't\nKnow what\nBut now it starts to get real so this is what they want and I remember burning them they they they believe the government can do a better and if they can't make it a nationalistic thing where they take over some of these things they want to be able to control some of these things well guess what let's talk about some control\nHow well the government do in Sweden when they kind of ran everything\nHaving the government manager will be things didn't work so we have to manage it in another they privatized\nWe realized in Sweden that with the government monopolies we don't get the innovation that we get when we have competitions and this is particularly true for the school system Sweden switched to a school voucher system that lets parents pick their kids' school and force the schools to compete\nSee this is where the Bernie's of the world and everything this is where they're going to come out and they're going to want to pick and choose because the last thing they want to do is give schools an opportunity to compete with one another every state right now going to an election\nThere's going to be on a majority of those some sort of school voucher fight or funding fight that's going on this is the name of their happening and and and while schools over there\nSchool voucher fight or funding fight that's going on this is a nightmare happening and and and\nWhile schools over their private schools are good guess what schools around private schools because of the competition had been forced to be better\nOh Bernie doesn't want any part if you tell a a socialist or progressive or even a hardcore Democrats that you want a school vouchers by and large most if not all of them but most of them will say\nUh no no now\nWhat about things like we get Social Security their pensions\nPrivatize the pension system that terrifies for you and hope usually that scares people but when they realize that the alternative was that the whole ... system would collapse they hope that this was much better than nothing well\nYes and their pension systems very interesting\nWhen things are going good you get your pension and potentially a little bit more when things are stopped down you're going to get a little bit less oh yeah yeah because people look at it and say well I'd rather have\nSeventy percent of something that a hundred percent of nothing and the way that it was going it was going to completely collapse but for all of the on the left to scream and yell about how they're able to do all the things that they're able to do\nWhen it comes to taxes and the fair share and the whole nine yards I told you over and over yet you don't listen how does the tax system work over there well guess what\n[noise]\nWhat sweetened does may surprise you despite the fact the Sweden looks like sort of a socialist country which taxes rich lord was in the high\nThe truth is the only\nPeople who weren't below average income pay up to sixty percent impacts the the the little secret about the sweetest type system we don't take from the rich and give to the poor we squeeze the poor because they are loyal taxpayers boom\nIt's a Ponzi scheme amongst the middle class\nAnd the lower income that's it the value added tax to twenty five percent tax the the the the huge taxes on all kinds of consumer goods\nThat allow them to pay for all of the things they don't go and tax the wealthy exorbitant lead because they know that their money makers and they generate and if you start to do that they saw that in the seventies what happens is they\nLeave so they had to find another way and this is the other income tax low but the value added tax nationwide is massive and it disproportionately hurts the people that the less screams they want to help\n\nBut we could make the rich pay their fair share what's their fair share Everytime I see a new study it shows how much they pay towards federal income tax what is enough that's the thing stopped telling me what their fair share is just once outlined it I Want them to pay this\nThere you go\nBut that's the look into what it is in the world of quote unquote the sweetest social model which isn't socialist at

because they they did the series on a on cable ... stories of people winning the lottery in just ended horribly I'm an someone did the story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials\nOr you know people just I just well first of all do you can't tell anyone you tell even your family word gets out even if you don't go public\nAt at when you claim the prize the word gets out\nWhen people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it then people come at you believing you didn't earn it so it feels mine for\nRelatives you didn't know you had in the whole thing um and and that's the real you know that's the real risk of it because that's like we said the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing\nAnd they were trying to win the money and their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it and you're there relative well wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know and sometimes it's not not even people view you know\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but\nNonprofits non stop knocking at your door you know and you want to give back I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that away if you fulfilled every request there would've been\nMuch more ... and when I was younger me winning the lottery in these days would be like what a hassle [laughter] well I don't take any life thought about it would change my life too much I I thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent you know of the overall prize a one point six billion so pair that down to about a ... you know somewhere around five\nHundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred\nMillion dollars that's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already you went to bed poorer than than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nYou know the story always goes you was one of the least rich guys and the Senate um and and you woke up richer than a minute [laughter] and and the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars\nYou know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car I wouldn't be able to stop and park it anywhere you know what I mean I mean ... where\nAre you going to take that ... I wouldn't mind taking it out to any gossip just plays the Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money\nI'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time\nWith six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank it would it would a high end there's the bit disturbed there's yeah there's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle mhm\nI like my life mhm I don't want to change mhm\nAnd I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a or that it changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I have\nA a friend who uh a friend or family member who a\nBat at one time was working for a a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day ... and my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time in the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day\nAnd how my schedule was very busy knocked out a multi billionaire although won't at least one listener thinks we are um but but the point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much\nMuch going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes uh you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else to\nDo I couldn't have lost anyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation ... you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kinda money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard demand that you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nYeah exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my laws there are laws without\nHaving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it all away that's what I mean they're going to be a fulltime job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh this life I have is gone my life is life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah\nAll right let's let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like when I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life [noise]\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life I I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things and I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so\nI'm I'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be\nGreatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know what I Would you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I miss this is one dumped off it goes through a mind but it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion mhm\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't you and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've got we've ever done really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up on Google today a little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really have it it's almost like we come to work at a warehouse that we have the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go home to ... that's what the\nFeeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nA side of being a machinist and so the mentality sort of the same for it\nSo I but the the the thought and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else\nThat become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life well you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I've on one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep death the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges and problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this\nThere was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it ah I I I don't know of I'll have to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game\nFor two billion dollars and his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then\nHe talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires and I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nThen I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know work you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was look I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird are pleased to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money I'm new money but I don't fit in\nWith these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's here's the problem with being famously wealth or like the the the person in my family member works for\nYou've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other you're famously wealthy so you have

different success stories inside those twenty four\nBut the largest district as about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly up

lot of them are\nUm and um you know are like Mike one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders um who you know kind of insurance success and uh you know there's nothing magical about the about the model it's not that\nThey have a bigger budget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district of but they've\nTaken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know and and that one instance things could be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of

I I think one of the differences is\nIf you're if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one it is on a superficial level of a level of quality that she didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean this much but it does and and the fact that\nThat suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles it and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent as who your sports teams play\nThere's a level of quality that a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team as an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job on on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes pop culture and a major league sports team make chew culturally relevant I mean when Russell Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players\nYou know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly um that sends a message that this is a good place to live\nUp in the I think that when sports starts to become tired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing what new facility after another new facility now and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nBut we're coming up with a break here that that does move here I Want to finish your thought on sports teams in the just a moment we'll be right back\nArizona's news station Katie a our news on Ninety two three F.

Oklahoma\n\nAre your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nWell I I yeah I think I think he's just sitting there like us there's a connection between the oil and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so\nYou know central Oklahoma was already on a fault it was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists that worked really hard and they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a ... a earthquakes but I think most people in Oklahoma have been very patient with oil and gas industry\nIt's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and most Oklahomans are thrilled that United States is in more control of its energy future going forward that we bend light burn and oil and gas industry is playing a major role in our economy\nUm but you know at some point their their technology it's got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring out the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out a without causes the harm on all the rest of this\nNow in the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course that's the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to energy or ...\nThe tide with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to energy or has it been in effect diversified\nYeah uncle in the city has diversified with the ...\nAnd so Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the ... string and as a result it's it's a it's caught on me and it's tax revenues cyclical are based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking that made them or a\nFish in industry uh you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas around it's more technology driven and they get more oil and gas that it was just go well these two and a and so the result of that as a whole if this is\nA one day they will pull its fewer people are but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I mean the oil and gas industries you know it's it's been a wonderful job in creating a better resources for our country here at the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to

in real time amid both storing praise and intense criticism Jillian what's happening\nOver the past you know ten or so years\nLocal communities states and others across the country have been experimenting with providing students with tuition free college and the idea kind of got a boost with the presidential elections that we saw Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton talk a lot about different ways that they could potentially may call it a college free\nArts so give an example or two of who is trying to watch\n[noise] yeah so states like Tennessee are you know arguing programs where they make community college free to you know to students in their states [laughter]\nUm and the idea behind it was kind of state level programs as you know it's a little bit more about workforce development so in Tennessee they were like\nWe need to attract more companies here to talk more companies here we need college educated workers how are we going to get them we're going to make college easier to pay for 'em and then when you know local communities that have these programs so the most famous example is in Kalamazoo, Michigan where a group of anonymous donors\nSaid in two thousand five you know everybody who graduates basically from ... or going to pay for them to go to college in Michigan and the idea behind those programs is that if you give the community free college kind of as an incentive than other organizations step up\nTo make it to that students can take advantage of it to the public high school to get better um non profits you know do more to offer after school tutoring you know the sort of the community rallies together to prepare these students for school and that's better for the community and now they're also individual schools that are you know\nSort of making some kind of tuition free promise for certain students I'm so they'll say if you come from a family making less than ... you can compare for free\nFor speaking with mark it was personal finance reporter Jillian Berman she's written a piece titled here's what it would take to make college tuition free\nOr at least a couple of these programs are maybe most of them it does seem like the organizers are having to hit up a lot of donors are gonna getting some of the bigger companies around the area to chip in\nSo that you know that's kind of one of the reasons why advocates of these things like the idea of the federal government doing it because then they can [noise] you know the funding is a little less\nPrecarious but yeah especially on a lot of community college systems are starting to offer these programs and at that level you know community colleges do\nThat sort of the huge fundraising arms of other\nColleges so it's really you know they're really like tapping donors repeatedly and you know they're trying to get corporations that kind of be sustaining donors but for these programs but it can be hard and if you you know promised students that you're going to do this you sort of half as deliver on it\nOr yes it's sustainable funny I mean is that the phrase you're going forward in terms of must tabs for these programs to continue and Dr\nPerformance and his um his a kind of insulting style um maybe there was also thinking in this environment political violent wind today that's the only thing that works we like it but maybe he's got a point\nAnd I think finally as somebody pointed out to me in the column the price of opposing Trump within the party was higher than some people thought they some of the people who spoke out against him at the beginning
