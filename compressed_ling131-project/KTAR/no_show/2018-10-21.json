you know the issue to rally his Republican base heading into the mid term elections the president frightening on Twitter and all types to quote close our southern border and Mexico it doesn't stop what he calls an onslaught within ... about two thousand migrants who fled Honduras\nAnd are making their way north and a caravan Mexico has said that migrants that have proper documents and enter that country but those who don't have to apply for refugee status or face deportation\nYeah it's an ugly situation and now they're fighting amongst themselves and I do mean that literally because today apparently John Bolton had or the other day and Kelly right got into a really normally you know shouting match that included dropping some ideal language ...\nSpokeswoman Sarah Sanders responding saying quote while we are passionate about solving illegal immigration we're in an angry with each other and then before\nIt from the argument to Congress saying the president is furious a Democrats for not helping solve the crisis Democrats don't control the house and Senate Mr Trump has been able to convince his own party to build a wall and then other security\nSo [noise]\nI just feel like I said okay if I was a break it down at what they were fighting about and it's just me this just me I think Kelly's more compassionate than boldness I think Bolden to super hard line I'm going with that one you might feel different\nBut I'm going with that I'm going with that one it's an ugly situation it's a horrible situation\nA but here's the reality of it if your the Republicans and you're trying to get your base up had capital and that got you excited\nRight\nNot the fact that he got in fact if you would have went through smoothly I don't think the base would be excited but because of the pushback the excitement was there and then you've got yeah this caravan that just seems to be hitting at the right time for a lack of a better term\nSo as soon as a wife and the struggle with a left wing movement which ones to radicalize America you know you're happy\nThat there are more people will work that's what people off of food stamps that meant they were no longer

was one is kind of an ... and the other is Carol\nSheriff and he made the right he absolutely may be right and this caravan can be hitting at the right time because people get excited and angry and Susan about Kavanaugh but we haven't heard a word in the last two weeks because it's you know outta sight outta mind it when we have the attention span of a net but with them moving up and this tomorrow\nTrump getting here in Arizona like kids here tonight but he'll speak tomorrow with Sally riling up the troops if you will is you can announce is going to put some troops out there is that a possibility that he may do something like that you never know\nBut that would rally a lot of the base get a lotta people excited\nAnd it and it's very strange\nI I mean I I feel I probably shouldn't say this but it's it's the truth that's how I feel and I'm all about owning the truth whatever but I feel really weird when I see so many men doing this like ... like I'm seeing all these videos all the time of like\nMen who are like freaking out about feminism and stuff and and the ... which is great I think we're like you said earlier were all about protecting women we all care about women\nFreaking out about feminism and stuff and and the ... which is great I think we're like you said earlier were all about protecting women we all care about women but there's it's not that it's like the lives that the media is telling about how the right wants to hurt women and then I see these men going bananas about it and stuff and I'm like\nI don't you get like they are being manipulated I it's just so weird to me I it's it's so strange\nYou know what it is Brennan is I Love watching them they they're everybody got and then they put themselves in that position how much further can I go you went this far will let me show you how far I can go\nThese like the man feminist or whatever it is that is the biggest weasel and all they're trying to do and for lack of better term is they're trying to get some and it's this whining about it that he ever\nI'm a man I'm assist gender heterosexual cracker mail and I will tell you there's right now I Love women I Want to protect women are and I and and I want equality or but I'm not going to bend over backwards to put somebody into a protected class\nLike species [laughter] not the way it should be but it's we manage ridiculous\nWell it is and it's yeah I mean you kind of hit the nail on the head with the basically there's there's two different classes\nOf of men are may possibly more but I mean there's kind of the fate of males which you're just sort of like what happened to your masculinity when you watch this but the ones that I was describing a moment ago or you know I just feel like I'm seeing all these videos lately of men on the left\nWho are like attacking even women on the rights I mean there was a video that I saw the other day of this woman she was wearing a Trump pat\nAnd out and publicly crossing the street and there's a guy behind her I mean he looks like ... seconds away from punching are on the base and at one moment she even said he says something he makes some nasty snide comments about nine eleven or something and she said actually my husband died on nine eleven and he goes good good he deserved it\n... and I'm like what what the hell happened to you like what is going on\nYeah we've lost the plot we've lost a lot of talking to a ... he's a ... the founder of the hash tag walk away movements so you've got this big thing is October what twenty seventh and you guys are going to get together and ah and that's what think progressive saying as this Russian trolls because that's that's that's where they go with everything now everything's Russia's fault and and everybody's All right\nUh so tell us about what's going on there\nYeah so uh we're doing a walkway march on Washington weekend which is the twenty sixth of the twenty eighth and obviously in DC I'm so that was coming right up it's a week and a half away the weekend after this one for kicking it off at the Gallup dinner at Trump International hotel\nUh it's going to be incredible um [noise] we're going to have lots of kind of high profile you know conservative celebrities on the right who are coming to attend to dinner and people are going to be speaking and it's going to be really just sort of like an elegant way to kick the weekend off and then the next day is the main event the march and rally\nUm which is open to for anyone to attend 'em and I want to make really clear to because I Do get these messages [noise] more often than I Would like with people saying you know I Would love to come here march rally it sounds so great but I didn't walk away so I don't think I should count\nGuys listen this is so important the people the people in the right who have been conservatives your whole life or Republicans your whole life you are what we call the walk with\nAnd your your attendance\nAt that march and rally is really the most important thing because all of these people who are walking away from the Democratic party and walking away from liberalism a lot of them are walking away from their friends their walking away from the family they're walking away from their jobs in some circumstances they need to know there are people on the other side who are going to walk\nWith them that they're not going to be alone that's why people stay people stay 'cause they think if I I think I\nI hate what this party stands for I don't even recognize the more but I Can't leave because I'll lose all my friends they need to know there are people walking with them so for those of you on the right who are lifelong conservative Republicans come out to this event and you see the walkway march on Washington and walk with\nThose who are walking away and then we're closing the whole thing out on Sunday at the twenty eighth with a closing brunch and punished as soon as it's going to be our guest speaker at the ...

right so that's the those that's the one or the day\nAnd you're supposed to pick oh you have two choices there to make let me know what you think and you can call in his eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine and seven thirty three thirty nine and we go to John in Seattle John you're on with mark\nHey mark how are you there I'm here that uh okay a life or is it John K sick I Believe he ran for president as a Democrat and I know it's probably a public and yeah\nShe did oh boy [laughter] well you balance the budget and\nYou know ever going to balance a budget that's who I think should run against Trump or you know at recess two thousand eight we've had quantitative easing we've had just government spending that's gone on and on and on with no end in sight\nAnd some well you know the somebody's got to pay the piper on that sooner or later and I think if somebody could make a case to show that they really know how to balance a budget\nThat would be who probably would stand a chance against Trump although I probably wouldn't vote for him on pretty much of traditional values\nCan serve you know it's to me a word that is consistent with conservative and you know if it works but it ain't broke don't fix it you know something that works it's a good thing\nA ... is Nikki Haley I Believe she has\nAn intellect that has a global perspective and I have a degree in anthropology\nAnd I would really like to sit down and talk to her about where she thinks waste and and the family of nations on this smaller and smaller planet that we have to learn to get along with each other and so those are a few of my thoughts what do you think mark\nWell first of all mentioned Nikki Haley is ... is amazing because lenient surprised me I I thought she was okay as governor of South Carolina but she's been a phenomenal or ambassador to the United nations really letting them haven't and\nVery courageous not being afraid to save like it is she's a very impressive lady I think she got to run for president maybe you know obviously not this time but in the future\nYeah yeah yeah I I don't have someone\nWith a very large perspective on who we are a nation and clearly we can be a good a good companion a good name a good partner in a global perspective I think that's very important so thanks\nFor those ideas well let me hold on\nOne second 'cause I'm going to ask you your ... your answer the question but\nI don't like John Case there's something about the guy\nOr does he didn't come across well he did run as a Republican last time against Trump and the others there's something about him that irritates me something I mean I I don't agree with him on everything is a little too liberal for me and that that's fine that's neither here nor there but the something personally about him\nI think he's arrogant I think he comes across that when I've heard some things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was used\nSome things about him I had a former a producer my TV show who said something about women or something like that that was years ago so that's not fair that is a rumor but something about that guy that rubs me the wrong way but you don't feel that way you'd like\nTo bail us budget I mean we we can go on with a kind of spending I mean I Love this country and we had a lot of good programs like head agriculture and you know we need to defend ourselves and\nYou know we we just can't keep going on every time somebody as another lobbyist that it was something that you just get it because they have enough money for the next campaign\nI mean that's both sides of the aisle it all and it's just going on and on and on\nAnd they can't go on forever I mean when you get to the point where the debt\nIs bigger the gross national product you know theoretically that's bankruptcy\nAnd we're we got to find a way you know we've got to find a way to to to have a better reasonable expectation about what kind of ... we can have in this country\nOne of the things I always say is people do not understand that the government\nHas no money of its own you'd be surprised maybe how many people think oh you remember the woman or during the Obama campaign the first ones that\nAre Obama's going to pay for a mortgage and pay for gas and they said where are you gonna where's he going to have his stash stash same out of a stash rice you he was going to personally pain so people don't know that they support the government has no money of its own I thank you very much for your call very well said and\nI appreciate it very much and we'll take the rest of your calls at eight six six Ninety red eye or right now\nYou're a national forecast for how many trucks\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook yeah it'll be warmer in the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nBut no parts of the country are expected to see a colder than normal winter\nNow NOAA warns the forecasts should not be interpreted to mean that periods of prolonged cold or heavy snows won't happen most of the country will be dry today with the exception of a place where we don't need any more rain and that's in Texas\nOr there was no cooperation all that kinda stuff\nBut there are other senators like uh what's the name of ... Heidi Heitkamp whatever name is she's in big trouble and in fact the way out is the whole ... a capital fiasco was helped the Republicans\nThe Democrats were always be there are always ready to go out there and\nDo anything they could to go against Trump\nBut now you've got Republicans motivated and in fact the Kevin I hadn't won I think they would have been so demoralized would have been worse but our problems are in the house the house representatives because it is quite possible that the Democrats could take back the house and as I've said for the last few nice if they take back the house\nYou're the Capitol hearing will pale\nIn comparison to what they'll do\nTrying to impeach Kevin I'm trying to teach Trump\nWith hearings with subpoena powers a with calling for their impeachment it's not going to be fun you\nKnow it's I think it's going to get ugly I personally but that that happens I think that uh nothing good will come out of that I promise you that that would be\nCrazy I mean I I honestly didn't leave anything forward said to me I didn't really do any of its critical to me um [noise] about I did a lot of background I have it all and he just seemed like the most honest\nHe's part of the water the what the best judges that are on\nThere as of right now in my opinion I mean he got all these other you\nI was going to say it seems like a decent guy and you as you started to say over three hundred opinions or whatever but the fact is you know in her case I just think that we're using her as long as we're talking about\nWho should run for president Democrats side uh Spartacus Booker and I call them that because of his own Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined it if someone didn't do that\nHis own name that Kamala Harris they they were just using that woman maybe maybe she imagined that if someone didn't do that assault on her all those things are possible but they use their for their own purposes it was disgusting to watch\nA it was difficult it was horrible it was really was it well then we are in which he was yeah that's what Lindsey Graham was so good when he came out and said\nThat I'm not going to put up with this stuff you guys are doing this for power you yeah you know now how not to be ashamed of yourself what you're willing to do I have but that's where they are they ought to be yeah\nWell thank you so much for the [noise]\nAbsolutely I'll I'll go back again\nWell thanks so much time and uh yeah Jo measure would be good picky seems like a decent guy uh like I said I don't it's not fair for me to take away some of his courage uh when he seems so nice and and reasonable and I think he is going to win but someone who is less than decent I said I mentioned this\nIs Hillary I'd love to see Hillary run again a for selfish reasons I think she is going to run again because these guys\nMeaning Hillary and bill they can't keep away from power\nThat's what the it's what is an aphrodisiac people say so and the Democrats even have figured that out they don't even want her to enter the fray she's viewed as the kiss of death for democratic candidates in the upcoming midterm election\nForcing the former presidential candidate to stay low and campaign only behind closed doors by the way that makes sense because I sit on the air for many months now you know she's still looking to see a why she lost\nLike she's going to come out I suggest that she'll come out with a book a hundred and one reasons why I lost in none of them will be her I have nothing to do with her\nAnd I said she could join OJ Simpson as he looks for the killer to figure out who killed his wife\nBut few Democrats are willing to embrace Clinton on the campaign trail despite the party's near universal support for just two years ago\nWith many concern that a high profile Clinton presence would only dampen the party's prospects of retaking control of Washington from Republicans\nYeah they're worried about her for half the mid term elections Clinton is rarely rally together with other candidates appearing mostly at low key fundraisers and low key 'cause she can't get many people to show up\nShe's the kiss of death won a party official said I'm telling the Washington Examiner Democrats don't want her to campaign for them because everywhere she goes she carries the stench of death when it's worse than I thought\nAnd it's the only political figure in America that has less popular than Donald Trump stretches that and that's a real testament to her\nDemocrats were relieved that the bill and Hillary Clinton announced that there are international Thirteen city speaking tour wouldn't begin until after November now that\nThat was a clever move I think they're measuring how they can have the best positive impact and have time decided to wait until after the election and that's what Dick Durbin of Illinois said a house Democrats segment of that saying when I think the people who've been part of our pushed to retake the house\nI just don't think of them at all I think it's a very good things that they're not being visible it wouldn't help our cans age\nBoy one minute you're the nominee for the Democratic party and the next minute they don't want to see anymore maybe that's part of the problem these guys don't know when to get off the stage\nActually but I like that Hillary can in twenty twenty I liked the sound of aid and I like our possibility that she could run up you know like our stamps she could run forever right but don't we have forever Sam's forever bill and Hillary could run you never get rid of them actually\nI can take them a lot better than Brock Obama right most presidents when they leave office they they're quiet and give that credit to George W. Bush\nBut not for Iraq Obama he's in there he can't sit still he can't keep quiet\nSo maybe Hillary and bill they do have some redeeming value for those of us on our side because if they run again if he runs again\nI think she's going to lose I think we got to get something going on our side Hillary for president in twenty twenty tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six nine of sudden same number thirty three thirty nine mark guys are filling in on red eye radio\nHow much do you know about synthetic oil heavy duty trucks have been running on traditional mineral oil for the last one hundred years but today's technology brings us other options to consider it a better quality\nUnlike mineral oils synthetic oils have a ... system molecular restructure giving it the ability to support pressures from Ira horse power engines especially at lower rpm ... it also allows oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy very cleaner synthetic\nIt was oil to reduce friction in an engine controlling temperatures and improving fuel economy\nThere cleaner synthetic pick up fewer contaminants as they do their job of lubrication they also have better oxidation stability resulting in an overall cleaner engine synthetic and somebody from ... may be a bigger investment up front but the benefits of its high quality composition will pay off in the long run\nThis report is a service of ...\n... told me to be with us [noise]\nDish a Gigi keeping you connected coast it goes from the comfort of your guests find out more additional by truck duck job or it's dues for my truck dot Gov\nIt's easy to guess what's inside a trunk\nBalance of products goods packed in ... but many never consider what's inside a trucker and the men and women are key business moving\nUp support communities the parents and providers brothers sisters neighbors inside you does the commitment to deliver a job well done\nTo sacrifice your purse your\nThank you show the engine oil to works as hard as you\nI Try and we know you've got plenty to manage on their own that we make life he was among a pilot flying J we'd gotten all you need more parking more fresh\nGreat coffee more clean showers in restaurants and with pilot mine's eight tracks hair service on night and on the road twenty four seven you want to have we got it at pilot flying J and get the pilot up to check out our getting real kind reserved showers and lots more\nDid you know that studies have shown that almost two and a half million truck drivers in the U.S have one or more serious health problems such as obesity diabetes heart disease even sleep disorders and our truck drivers lack the same access to health that other Americans enjoy\nThe unfortunate result of these circumstances is that drivers are often unable to get treatment and the early stages of disease minor illnesses become severe leading to hospitalization and disability the driver then may lose their CDL and become unable to work\nThis creates a downward spiral that leads to extreme financial hardship and possible unemployment\nGo to truckers won dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nTo learn how SDF can help we encourage you to educate yourself in tears on the sink Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help too that's truckers fund dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nIf you're a trucking industry professional then you need to be in the know and there's no one more in the nose and the readers of owner magazine written for executives and managers fleet owner provides information on operation vehicle maintenance regulations and information technology but that's\nAnd if you're not fueling at a TA Petra location today while you're in luck you can simply go to ... wrote king dot com on your tablet or laptop to read a page turning version\nWould you prefer to read wrote getting on your smartphone or scroll down version is also available at ... dot com simply click on view digital version or current issue to listen on your smartphone or Bluetooth connected headset or speakers just activate by clicking on the speaker icon\nFor any story and voila just start listening rotating dot com\n...

about four months ago before enrolling in financial ... feel like I made one of the worst mistakes in my lap us [laughter] I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how it would affect me if I were to return Elise car\nTo the dealership or at this point or just keep the vehicle or none of the above we take her car back that you own money on our signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to solve it\nAnd the lease on that's effectively\nA voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb\nBecause they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and are there and on a repossession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference if you don't pay them the difference immediately\nAnd you don't have the difference she goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car free ... company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than the title of your lease payments pleasure residual value at the end it should be less because you're these leases are very new and there should be it's kind of like an early pay off I'm Alone when it doesn't include all the intro stripped from\nThe time that you know from keeping alone the whole time\nShow the early buyout as your hourly pay off now now that what it's what struck by the car off and get the title in your hand then you compare that to KB dot com Kelley Blue book dot com private sale what the car is actually worse\nAnd I'll just make up some numbers let's pretend that the early buyout is twenty thousand and then you look it up in the car is actually worse sixteen thousand that would leave you four thousand dollars in the whole probably not far off of what you're going to find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in order to get the title for the buyer\nAnd so um\nYou have to have that other four thousand dollars you have to be able to cover the whole that you're in the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount that you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report a lot to the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are so um they ribs utility to borrow money no direct she's telling you to move some of the debt and get rid of the majority of the debt by doing that\nAnd so you borrow and cover\nThe amount that you're upside down [noise]\nYou know guys we been talking a lot about this millionaire mindset around here and why it's so important to be
