well [noise] uh latest [noise] here on the events from yesterday the FBI said ah last evening that it had identified seven suspicious packages\nAddressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote the\nBureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible\nThat additional packages were mailed to other locations\nUh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the poll strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have information to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central mail facility was evacuated after employees\nFound a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported\nWas addressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to waters that were similar to the five and a reference and its earlier statement\nThe LA police department

thing that is\nIt's the latest that we uh have a right now uh again or the one thing that is\nA but I I think uh\nEverybody wants to know is where these lie bombs were the Israel bombs now we must admit that ah that the national review story that has overnight gone viral on social media\nThey're saying the powder was homeless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way right on that one so\nUh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from the the the Democrats are you know we're picking where well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't have any\nVery few very few windows ... we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities have told us already the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise you but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television yesterday saying well it looks like see what you got here and what you got here okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um you can tell the like the label\nOn the packaging that went to see Annette well we know it had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things but in terms of\nThe the bomb experts that Ron well here's what it looks like

October was Fox News we're ... was a tie a than the misery scout that has all the up by one in that until a dead heat yeah it is it is is a dead heat and\nSo the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad is what is said and\nHeat and so the fascinating thing about uh this radio ad is what is said in it where there's you'll hear two men talking\nAnd they're talking about you know a Josh Holly and the problems with him that uh the claim is he gets wind and works out during work hours which we found really interesting per cent of raised to be the main accusation and an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation at yeah they'd be purchased why not but he drinks why why he purchased why hurt just wind and went to work out right uh and when you're an attorney general which probably your hours\nYou're probably a salaried workers were just as your state a salaried employee is\nUh yeah uh but [laughter] but I I'm thinking that that that's it but uh do we know what will play coming up on after falling the bottom of the ... yeah it's about admitted that I Want to play the whole thing and it's where they get into the two people talking and this is for campaign at by the way this is not some pack running the ad some other outside group\nIt's\nYou can use real real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people who are the sentiment of people um and they probably couldn't find it to be\nWhat am I I Will set it aside I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that at a uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but\nIn that ad it was terrorists twice here's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry or the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nUm you know they ... yeah right well you know but you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts and they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah which\nYou know I Will see if if that point works or if if any of this works er here within two weeks\n[laughter] it's a I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was\nI'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we've pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here in terms of the\nWord crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning hear that word is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... or you know with my my party in it no so I wrote a writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation didn't say look she doesn't always agree with her party\nAnd there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term as you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and then she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put in to that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly\nIn that ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats\nRight yeah because I think what they're\nThinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that they're there they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats right but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and\nNot a you know not radical not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing\nIs that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr better Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races in other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck\nAnd and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we so\nThat's the effect is that come out one Harris or or ... with Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going look or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point a Kamala Harris or you know inside with\nAs you're crazy Democrats she'd as she just did as having us [laughter]\n... which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote app and\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but it's not\nThose Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThan it doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats whip that no vote she condones that behavioral Lenny we saw during the cop Kavanaugh process\nAnd and that's why I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should thing and we're not ... we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and so they're crazy I mean they're they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the ... coming back from that\nAd may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy\nThat you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right but you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the lame that we will do you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with\nThat vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior\nHim not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yet to come in to that conclusion yes haven't I'll just prove that eight six six Ninety right

say good oversight committee and get your methods that won't happen so [laughter] yeah well I have to declassify it uh yeah well they now you know that the the things that are ...\nAnd yeah thanks that's because we we saw what you're going to say we we knew where you were ... we were going with it a ... it's a it is fascinating though because it is something look isn't that the number one question that you would want to ask is a reporter mhm that report them I'm sure they're gonna have a press conference today support is going to ask 'cause the was were the bombs libre not\nRight where they you know we're we're could they have been a detonated by opening the package because the concern is not just a you know about you know the message being sent or the intent of the person or persons responsible\nBut also about the threat that is still or might still be out there in in the system because let's say that they were going or are going through stages where they're reaching out to these individuals' first and then there are others on their list\nWell the concern would be by you know the the package handlers and people that might even be walking on a ... up to a porch\nAnd and they see something worth these devices ready to go off because they have been detonated a readily either remotely or by opening a package I think that's information that needs to be made\nA available to the public as soon as possible you know without impeding the investigation itself if possible [noise] ah\nJust we got to bring this up quickly I I haven't checked the overnight markets you know I haven't I haven't checked but six hundred down down yesterday and the the ... as he also down ... down I think was it four point four percent yesterday and yeah yeah uh the\nUh the Dow down over six hundred ... and a lot of that had to do with earnings and and we're hearing more and more ah companies come out and say that their earnings are suffering as a result of what's going on uh the terrorists from retaliatory tariffs by trade partners is having an impact on on business so overnight\nAs it is up and which I which you might expect mhm uh all the Asian markets are down one percent three the three percent for the Japanese market down three percent a Shanghai up a little bit above ... percent yeah uh Europe a mixture of over in Europe so\nWe'll see whether it's just a correction whether there's really worry\nWe know there is in the housing market and we know for example but you know Ford coming down\nAnd and saying look thanks for all the thanks for all the help with the tax cuts but the terrorists are killing us and and\nIt's something like what happened yesterday in the news playing out makes a lot of people nervous and and of course than the markets because one possibility up to consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nOf course than the markets because one possible you have to consider is that it was a foreign enemy a that was that was involved are responsible\nFor these suspicious packages and and the the concern that it might not be over or something else might happen and we it was a lot of uncertainty yesterday so some of that is built into that drop I mean you often see that if there is something that that is happening\nOr as as big of a news story as as you saw yesterday or that does make the the market's very nervous so uh we'll see where\nIt well and that's something that was you know was was brought up yesterday by you know some of the experts say look you know there's there's three things that could be it could be somebody and they ride it could be somebody in the lab it could also be a foreign entity\nRight you know just to disrupt the American you know an electoral process or it could be just terrorists\nYeah who have decided to do it again which that's that's probably find it surprising that a so late into this because it's been three days since the ...\nA bomb initially that nobody has stated whether these were active lie bombs that would have gone off right if if somebody would have touched it in a different way right apparently they were handled it didn't go off\nWell because I Would think that if there was a threat of these devices going off whether they could be set off a remotely or by handling the package itself that we would see that warning come out by authorities would we not\nYeah because if we learned that that was the case and they didn't warn the public and there was still a possibility of such devices being in the mail system or being out there in in the public and it's still being a threat to the public beyond that the intended recipient recipients over the past few days\nThat they would want to get that message out and and we would be hearing that I Would think that and if we hear that that you know that they were armed and and they didn't say it will someone's going to have to answer them for on attracts here's your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers hugging along the east coast\nAs well as a system out of Canada providing showers for the northeast and Great Lakes\nAnd that system will sweep as far back as the northern plains to provide showers from North Dakota into Wisconsin Minnesota portions of Michigan and upstate New York the south will be drying out today the deep south as well as the southern plains Texas dry this weekend\nBut it was interesting too so I understand uh the the the fact of of using the pre existing conditions because all Democrats are using that Schumer said we've got to go and we've got to hit that so you knew that was going to be the messaging\nOr not you're not surprised or shocked but very interested in the fact that the biggest issue was mentioned twice was the terrorists now I don't know why you take valuable time because if if you believe as a Democrat\nThat the tariffs\nThat are on products that are hurting farmers in the mid west\nAnd you believe in and you you you mentioned it you know white okay because you believe it's important you also know or you believe is we had we inside this way back when in springtime\nOr you know we've said this when when the uh weight before that we saw this one the Republicans passed the health care bill we said don't be surprised if it comes back and it's a negative against you not a positive anymore but has used against you in in the mid term elections and it has been\nSo you've got that and you've got the terrorists that you believe you mentioned it to white in there because you believe that there's a significant number of people who might be attractive to that anti terrorist message\nThat Trump has been so louder mhm\nWhy are you throwing in and wasting any valuable time in a commercial about when he's on the job he went apparently the claim is he went and bought wine and went to the gym anybody knows that when you're an attorney general here ... you don't work hourly\nYou know you're you're you're you're really you're on your ever on the work you're ... right so if you're sitting there and say oh okay I'm going wrong the stop by and get a bottle of wine or something like that or I go to the gym during the day\nBecause that's a lot of people to go to the during the day when best time to go or you know but but that's it\nDidn't like that or I go to the gym during the day because that's a lot of the day when\nBest time to go or you know but but that's it they didn't ... there was no real focus honestly they would have been better to leave that out completely and joke goes straight onto the crazy Democrat well maybe they maybe they should have mentioned the crazy Democrat twice and\nBy the way I was just thinking the law and order\nMm I'd uh you know didn't didn't ah I Can't think of his name uh didn't he ended up running for da\n... oh yeah yeah jak ran for Diego he was he became ... now did did the opposition never used the fact that they they ring ring or are in their office all the time that we've always talked to weight loss and them on TV [laughter] they drink coffee after every case win or lose fighter and they're drinking at the end of the day and they're off and not wine\nBy ... it was hard liquor they're always drinking so we thought\nAnd so when I heard that when it come on come on [laughter] they're\nThey're prosecutors they don't drink either [laughter] but but\nYet when we and getting back to the ad and you said there certainly are on the show that because we focused and I'm using the term crazy Democrat instead of using the term extremist Democrat yes ... leadership of the Democrat address\nRight there's the verbiage is clearly some kind of response that they got verbatim they were hearing that repeatedly that phrase crazy Democrats by people in their cola\nThe in there and turtles were showing that this was a they you know this was a way a hot button that they could connect to some of those undecideds right now those independents\nWho were leaning right at that moment and the concern they had was the crazy Democrats\nThe ... that's that's why that was you know it was used\nAnd directly came from a likely from that that kind of call out research response that you get\nBecause there's there's no other way ... there's no other reason\nTo put that in and that that becomes what the Hail Mary in this really neck and neck dead heat race in Missouri it is I mean it's out of all of them I think it's probably\nA if it's not the closest it's pretty pretty close to the closest Senate race right now uh so I think it's it's um\nClear that they want him to connect with those people that are leaning right that our independence that are winning right might otherwise what from McCaskill the problem in that is her her actions is specifically with with capital because in siding with her party Kavanaugh\nYou were condoning that kind of behavior right and you can come out and say no I just wasn't sure and I need to be short when we see that doesn't sorry perception is reality especially\nIn in in this kind of situation that is that is going to end could well that issue decide and many of these races the uh the outcome of the the Kavanaugh situation\nAnd and when you look at the polling there in in Missouri to begin with a a if you look at the September polling a you know as the CNN a McCaskill was up by by uh by three with a with likely voters and you get to the Fox news poll which was up until was nine twenty nine to ten to and it was a tie\nAnd then you know through that whole time the cabin all thing in ... Missouri scout a huge sample of of over twelve hundred likely voters\nAnd holy up one still margin of error is to point seven right uh and still nobody is at the fifty percent mark so there's still a ton of undecided there the\nUsing that term crazy Democrats a Democrat using that in an ad by the way apparently ticked off other Democrats in Missouri I was reading an article on that earlier up but using that term means that the undecideds are talking about it\nThe undecided that's part of their mind set\nYou know the Democrats are crazy these are crazy Democrats now that had to come directly from cabinet yeah because for that to be to do it for that to go to the level of\nUh from fringe to extremists\nToo I just read my leadership too crazy Democrats mean that exact term they're not stir crazy that is the mindset that they view when they significant portion\nOf undecided independents in Missouri that she's trying to get aboard I'm not part of the Democrats I'm not part of the crazy Democrats I I I I think for myself I'll go to the middle I Will compromise which means mutt you'll compromise with Republicans and\nYeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here\nLike in ... yeah\nYou know it's it's a ... this is why you have this race that you have here it's not because her opponent\nIs is is this big great strong opponent\nIt's because there's weakness across the board and [laughter] it is bipartisan week in nature I mean she's getting she's get of course they're they're Republicans in that state that would never vote for a ... you know that that that's a given\nBut those people in the middle of this is what we've been talking about for a long long time those are the ones that may vote one way or the other in terms for one party or the other\nAnd they're the ones you have to convince\nThey're the ones that get you over the top and right now she has too many weaknesses that that hurt that really don't serve her well with either side and I think that comes directly or certainly her vote on Kavanaugh was an indication of that\nWeakness if if it didn't help create well you know there's it's it's one thing you know you you can uh the the uh\nInsults the ah the accusations against Donald Trump being crazy being not you know everything that you remember the whole mental health thing that has sort of disappeared hasn't it\nNow but he's mentally ill and all that but you know you can look at that and you say okay that's that's an attack that's always thrown at at one person the president always gets that you were talking about a political party as a whole we've been talking about the the the Democrats from twenty sixteen where they said look we've got to go and figure out what the people the heartland as\nAre going and we said back then we said yeah but they're they're talking crazy stuff\nThey're talking you know the whole transgender saying look we have compassion for everybody but if you think you're a ... if you think you're a man and you're a woman doesn't make you want man and it doesn't make a man and shouldn't make you a man legally and you shouldn't as a man be able to compete against a woman ... the ... majority of Americans believe that\nThe trans racial thing that they started adopting President Obama before he left office talking about the fact that he's come to know that race is a social construct no it's not\nRight and and so we talked about that craziness well it's gotten to the point\nIf it's no longer the Democrats in order for Claire McCaskill to put that in the concern is no longer the Democrats aren't relating to the average person it's at the average person has now joined the Democrats as crazy ... and the capital thing I Believe is what put them over the top\nYeah and and and that behavior by the way as we pointed out not from protesters from from the high ranking officials and and and members of the party on those committees\nClaire McCaskill's now as a Democrat

kind of start over\nHow much debt do you have not counting your house or fifty three thousand [noise] and so on your home will clear that yes and then somebody would a much more would you put in your pocket pass that\nAre probably about twenty five plus thousand math or you know real toughie that every day\nOkay and so um what's your household income today\nAbout eighty thousand okay so you just don't like the house\nWe're not in love with it or we bought it for and a half years ago um 'cause we want it to chase somebody else's dream and then we're realizing it's not our dream and\nIt was either a mortgage racing\nJust deciding oh I Will ever oh man you know I'm so we we don't we're not ... uh and we have different goals in our priorities have changed so\n\nOkay so where are you going to live\nA well that was kind of in the plan with we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put uh some of the other money put it in as our emergency fund and then either rent for a short period of time what we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know they will enjoy\nMhm oh

the than I think you got it on your show certainly thank you how can I help [noise]\nOkay [noise] so I and follow your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency find that I'm working on baby step too good a night and I had made progress not a ton of it's on\nOur night issue is I give a chronic on that on and I still work with her own I Am not letting it take up all night\nAnd I ... I have a chronic illness and I still work fulltime and I and not letting it take all my life is good and my question is how do I I check 'em for my deductible\nAhmed ... recently I recently switched ... death about started again I'm\nNot a chronic illness you're going to hit the duck double every year\nRight um\nIt's the same guy that from happening on the go at it it's not they don't see it and it's not life threatening are you going to do it every year\nYeah okay so ... what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that is that it's an air tanker commissioned officers are I'm sure I've got more comes on okay God and so if\nIt was over there but I Do is because it's relatively new got I got I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months\nYou're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right right and you just put that in as a budget items so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand over to duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month\nIf it's three thousand dollars a year this is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know\nA a whatever a line in your budget\nFor medical expands home doing chronic medical and just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money you set aside so that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and new you know it's not a lifetime of this or something now yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so ... for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\nI mean my issue is is that I'm literally on like penny pinching\nI don't like seeing where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you a ... right now on what I'm I'm hoping over time on the opposite you know pay out more\nSo why did why are we finally got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where you\nDon't want to identify with that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that\nI make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switch to a job I had more flexibility on Sunday in a fee for service division as opposed to a salaried\nPosition mhm and then I make anywhere from Thirteen hundred Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nI knew that I saw a month on line you back twice a month okay and you said you're living with a\nGuy gets them I'm living with a roommate I paying nine Seventy five or rent it give us a lot um and I do that from ... from ...\nTo them and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nPratt is everything credit card all also because they can hit I was trying lot of holistic thing on medical and then it's student loan as most of it for him to go out and get it to\nHave like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that's food pantry\nNot eating not eating out in your pantry and I think you're like from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shoulder clothing and transportation and utilities the eighth grade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities only the debt you've got is not necessities\nYou take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work this out into the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in here for these medical expenses or they're going to be new debt\nRight because they are coming you told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah\nMean it's not me declaring it I'm saying ... actually I got home we had a full how do I prepare for it you save uncover it so now that's our short term long term okay we got to get you\nSure I've got her home Going Radical how to prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term wrong we got to get your income up and you're out go down and knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get take care of short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be\nPrepared to take on the long term which is get your income up but uh we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you got to really start looking at this career really hard tropical credit cards is Tom for plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife I'm going through a baby step here right now I'm In fact we gets paid off our second credit card today though we are dollar credit card and move around if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're worried that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday and um after church we had a big argument about hiding\nI don't know if we want to ... percent and um I ... that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can get later\nOn but what I'm saying what economists model that I'm kind of a ... of all I Want to get your input on it\nWe have our ten percent but it but we want to die without thinking about what and bought out and given back to church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to um other\nCharitable organizations that we believe in that are doing day the ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trying to get what we can to people who need it\nUm but if she's on the other hand want straight and present a church and being what we do what we can't give you know we're not um ... and she wants to give her the chart and\nWe had a big argument about five and yesterday was\nOut on you know the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament\nIs chance it literally means chant the word means tent it doesn't mean sphere that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him\nNow you can decide whether you want to tie the knot you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker a plan is er Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter\nTo me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you\nI Love you and um you can give are not given all still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts and all throughout\nThe Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed as in the New Testament is a time of the tens of your income evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that five is your baseline minimum giving and it
