you There God did you hear me in our town going\nOkay I'm Sorry I was saying you\nUm so I was saying you know kids to you when they start getting to the age of of even slightly paying attention to

before\nWho the president is makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people all they hear is that side and now the Trump although we have the media against this which hurts a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives are improving the lives of their parents that starts to influence them and more people like that ... in his own microcosm in his family\nThat ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama you

questions you have to allow me for your for your author's\nAs a member of very overcharged in this country it was set our documentary years to go on after Charlotte I recorded on my TV that the freeway says Chicago or destroy our radar metric appalling ... false ...\nYour guests talk at a book about ... took appalled\nI mainly mainly ... caught a mob and how they were used they were they were they were successful even if it's just for the political system in Chicago Jews as powerful cover for a a criminal beach could your guest quite smartly\nI'd I'd I daresay they can attack a Lowe's All right uh I was not aware of the ... played any particular role in this at all but uh you tell me gentleman\nWell probably ... indirectly and back to the business community would have been a made up of many pre masons and who who joined together to as Brad mentioned to try to take\nA bone down uh the reason was not as altruistic as you might think because ... was a terrible public relations disaster for the city or he he was a gangster who who love publicity who wanted to be liked\nWhile meanwhile the the people like a ... who was actually named Frank NATO and others on on mob uh they went down to more traditional business role in that that kind of fit in with what the gentleman earlier asked about the the business aspect of this the\nAh the the parallel and even the uh the event the eventual emerging into\nLegitimate legitimate business uh and I think to to touch on on the other question the gym caught a mob for example all all of those people pretty much grew out of the old coupon mob you have people\nYou have people growing up they they started as drivers or their enforcers are there going around picking up money and collecting\nAnd a lot of these people are are thugs is young young man and then they grow into\nA you know they grow into positions of power ah it was pretty insulated even though Capone was well known for not being ethnically pure ... you know he had he had all kinds of ethnic backgrounds and the people that that he assembled but the people that he trusted him that he assembled with him\nUh they they tended to stay close\n... uh and the successors as you get caught and others are\nAre we we talk the book\nBasically ends um in Nineteen thirty three with with the end of prohibition um but even that we get into the transfer of power between a between compound to a Frank ... hours you know ... more commonly known 'em and then there's sort of an Epilogue A final chapter that looks more broadly at\nUh the fact that ah ... the battle between ness and compound both in reality and sort of the mass of the impact that has had and continues to have a on the city of Chicago and and it's politics and the interplay between a crime and government tend and media and all sorts of those things\nWithout prohibition would component of even existed as a mobster\nHe would've been a low level criminal who never rose or much beyond where he started in life or in the in the slums of Brooklyn probably um you know he's he is out of the protege of a fellow named John ...\nWho was really the first corporate minded gangster someone who realized that this could be a business and when prohibition comes in and creates this whole new market\nOr that his patronize by legitimate people not people who consider themselves outside the realm of the law he capitalize on it and sort of paved the way for for ... to do so in one story I was out\nUm compound steps in 'em and it's this influx of money and and attention frankly again as Michael said coupon courted celebrity that makes him into the icon that he becomes and certainly we would never be talking about him or in the twenty first century if it hadn't been for prohibition\nIn terms of the the sheer power of the ... bone mob is there any comparison let's say with the power wielded today in northern Mexico by the drug cartels\nBut certainly the same the same kind of thing are particularly if you you look at the way or the so called legitimate government can be be in league with these ah ... ... with these kinds of groups [noise] ah it was\nReally pretty much felt like a poll around the city for a long time and I ... I think that probably was an over simplification again he becomes such a public relations problem for the city that that the uh you know the people around him are privately\nCollaborating with with federal agents to get rid of him because the the idea was we have to it's early in the depression and he's a he's a bad uh you know he's a bad black guy for\nThe federal government in general that's why why Hoover himself and I'm not talking about J Edgar Hoover ... president Hoover\nTook a a major interest in and taking you know taking Capone down because at this time components feeding all of this popular culture\nThings like you know all of the Warner Brothers movies like little Caesar and scar face and a public enemy and he is in Nineteen thirty one he is uh the first filling in Dick Tracy\nPecan famous comic strip and also a Dick Tracy is I I was ... myself found out from sister goal to create or the strip that uh that\nTracey was based on that so you have a component death going into popular culture and and from them\nBlossom the produce tobacco gangster almost every major gangster that's followed to some degree is based on a bone\nAnd every every a detective who had a snap room for door and a trench coat or Amazon earth or even dishonest were were patterned after after after and if\nWe're going to take a quick break come back with some more of your calls and the more information about Scarface and be untouchable and the things we never knew back in a moment\nNew stations Katie a our news on Ninety two three F.

destined to be in law enforcement\nWell he certainly he he was as a young boy interested in Sherlock Holmes and I'm probably read the Carter dime novels and so on uh I I think we might mention too that they're they're interesting parallels between these two men because\nUm they both they both are the sons of immigrants they both\nHave a fathers who are are legitimate businessmen a barber and components case and in a nest this case of really quite successful Baker who had bakeries and and the Chicago area\nAnd I think was the ... the ... ah influence of a brother or my brother in law Alexander Jamie who became a federal agent and the kind of a I think the melodrama and romance of that\nActual real life detective being in his life really uh really drew a nest to it and there's also the element of of him being a very very smart young man who ... who for a while it looked like he was going to be a lawyer and uh\nAlso you know you have lawyers and doctors\nBut he looks at law enforcement and see that things are changing that forensics is coming in and out of a level of sophistication coming into law enforcement that and existed before\nAnd he sees as an opportunity to make law enforcement a real legitimate profession and so so that's his ambition that's his path fairly early\nBecause he's very on both of these men are quite young when when they're famous struggle happens or you know late twenties and the case of of ah\nOf mess and ah the Pentagon where your data from\nYou know you have you have ... in his mid twenties basically up into a too is just as early thirties when he's at is at its height and his downfall so so you have a you have these kind of parallel tracks between these two men because Capone is viewing\nIs one of the first to really view\nCrime as a business as a as an industry as a veteran so I have these two professionals in law enforcement and crime on a or a on a collision course in history\nYou know I ended up they both died rather young actually a couple of them was a forty eight ... fifty four\nComponents forty yes for forty eight um he had just turned forty eight um and and that's in particular they both sort of had

do they know anything about that when that would have been\nThat is absolutely the case um after Capone was released a he had he was he stayed most of his his prison term in Alcatraz or and then after he had this sort of psychotic break\nBrought about by syphilis he was transferred to another institution in Los Angeles um and then and then eventually released um taken to Pennsylvania for being
