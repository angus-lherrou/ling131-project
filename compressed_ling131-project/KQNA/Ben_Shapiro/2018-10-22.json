looking forward to the ... midterm elections coming up in just a couple of weeks here the polls in the lead up to the midterm elections\nAre starting to look a lot better for the Republican the reason for that is because Democrats suck it everything there is a lot of attempt on the right to claim that this is all Republican no hell and suddenly Republicans are good at thing\nNo what what's really happening here in the Democratic math is often Democrats are garbage and everything\nBasically when President Trump is the second thing in the news that a very good thing for Republicans when he was the first thing in the news it's a problem so and Democrats been weak demonstrating they don't care about due process and then they will railroaded by simply for political reasons vary the Republicans when\nThe lead headline is the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats setting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for Republican when the lead headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz in a restaurant and screaming at him and his wife very good for Republicans the best friend up Republicans right now\nIn the insanity of the Democrats and you weren't seeing that full scale in the polls also obviously you're in the back of a very good economy on the Republican the margin by which voters crop Republicans over Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling really they are plus Seventeen and this polish the maze and also\nI don't want to give credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good thing number one he has taken proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the president of the United states does make it feel like he has a change actor\nAnd usually in midterm elections there is an attempt to vote for change right now what the whole show is that Republicans are actually seen as the party of change well being the party in power that's really unusual usually the party out of power at the end of the party and pay a because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that and then he feels like a change agent even though he is the guy who's sitting in the thing that is very good for Republicans here is what the latest polls show according to the wall Street Journal\nVoter interest in the midterm elections has searched for record within both parties helping to drive up President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrat lean and the party most preferred to leave Congress according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News news poll\nFindings point to an energized electric\nPopulated by dynamics that brings great uncertainty the outcome of an election just two weeks away and what the polls tightened up show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters Troy high level of interest in the election that has the highest ever recorded in a midterm election since the journal NBC poll began asking the question in two thousand six\nAnd now the reason for that is because largely under Democrats metal cross we're always going to be energized to vote against President Trump but now Republicans are really mobilized vote against the Democrats I Know that my interest in voting peaked significantly\nThanks to the Democrats behavior during the ... have not solved that and I know that most other Republicans\nFeel the same one large gap between Republican voters in democratic voters interest in the election has now then call it sixty percent of Republican voter and

a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrats continue to push the tissue are going to lose it's funny because Democrats or so in ... in their own bubble in what poll showed that Democrats have far fewer Republican friends that Republicans have Democrat friends\nBecause Democrats who live in areas actually she Republicans as ... human beings and so they won't even talk to them they actually believe that it's a mainstream view that people should be able to flood into the country\nActually believe that at the mainstream view that gender insects are completely separate\nAnd not only that that if a man called himself a woman that that man is than a woman the latest evidence of this is I mean there's an amazing story is the way the media are covering an attempt by the department of education to to find what title nine actually sat here the headline\nFrom the New York times today it's as transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you\nIt sounds like the Trump Administration saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nGender did for your gender identity disorder that's what it would generally from that headline\nIs that what's actually happening no that's not what's actually happening because that's idiotic and nobody is saying there aren't people who are transgender\nWhat the Trump Administration is saying is that under the law was that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological ... they're not focused on you thinking you were a member of a different track so when the civil rights act was written and it included language about\nMen and women and sex discrimination it did not mean that it affects discrimination for you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom ... as a woman\nAnd you'd say that's not cool we're not going to do that\nThat's not the same thing as saying woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination\nAnd that that's what the Trump Administration thing they're saying\nBehavior by men is not the same as being female\nThat the actual what I'll read the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that's what they're doing the media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because they refused to even acknowledge the fact that there is such a thing of biological sex it's orderly self defeating within what the ...\nThe gender insects are exactly separate but gender is backed\nBy so gender insects are completely that where you can be a man but your gender is female and that makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman\nThis is how they want to read the law and make no sense under any circumstances I explain in just one second they think it's a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane it's insane\nBut first let's talk

President Trump railed the fake news this is what he's talking about this sort of headline from the New York times transgender could be to find out of existence under trumped administration when we're just going to disappear the transgender is now know that is not what they're doing here is what they're doing quote\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at first the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because of gender is biological and immutable and it is delivered for\nNot what the what's the status they've redefined the term one of the great ... areas of confusion in the transgender debate is what the hell everyone's talking about really I mean that because sometimes when people on what the gender what they mean is expressed feminine or masculine quality and sometimes what they mean is actual sex\nAnd it is impossible to tell which unless they actually start to buy and then they shifted definition based on what they want their point can be the what is really the one making the case it only two genders they're saying that if you're a feminine and you're actually a woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually a man\nIf he wanted to find gender and just expressed characteristic of femininity or masculinity there are seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say the gender has to do with biology\nYou have to separate it into sex sex is based on y chromosome than X chromosome now they're intersects people did a very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates they're arguing that you can be fully genetically male and female\nAll of this and make no logical sense it's completely confusing because it makes no sense there was no internal consistency or logic to the transgender civil rights movement they can't even find their term\nIf they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman is a woman that Caitlyn Jenner is just as much of a woman as my wife gave me a freaking break and everyone would have a brain on planet earth knows that\nBut there is what the New York times that\nA series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concepts of gender in federal programs including in education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth first of all sects assigned at birth is the dumbest term in the world only the gender assigned at birth at least now you're being consistent with the terminology\nBut even that sentence you can see the terminology shifting right there's gender and then their sex assigned at birth\nYou don't sign a sex at birth\nBabies are born they are what they are when my girl was born she was a girl I did not sign her girl\nYou know what China or girl genetics God that was sort of baked in you know I Know 'cause she's a girl my God people\nAnd the same thing with my son when he was born\nYou know I knew he was a boy I looked at him\nWow this was difficult and it turned out he is in fact a boy amazing that the coincidence they come out near the all male characteristics and the heat also boy\nUnreal just amazing\nAlmost scientific ooh okay so here's what they say the policy prompted fights over bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas or gender was once seen as a simple concept conservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times conservative especially evangelical Christians were and since this is a way of slandering religious people as they get\nPaid not people who actually use their brain and recognize that there are men and women and these are two separate categories\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that one I mean women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups and the same thing for men's groups\nAnd the same thing for bathrooms no it must be that there is those crazy people believe in the genes it's those people the people who weren't for those crazies believing the Jesus\nThen it would then everything will be fine that we can all acknowledge the men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage and blow\nThe here's the New York times has now here's the bad stuff okay what's the bad thing that Trump Administration did\nIs a bad stuff okay what's the bad thing to talk to him and his record that\nNow the department of health and Human Services it's spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under title mine the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education programs that will receive government financial assistance according to a memo obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues and it's a memo that the government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined on a biological basis that is clear grounded in science objective an administrative all\nThe agencies propose definition with defined set 'cause he's a male or female an changeable and determined by the general a person is bored with according to the rapper ... by the time any dispute about once asked what happened he clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world is that not just basic rationality\nAnd nuclear woman I should be able to get to tell whether you're a woman or not it shouldn't be up to it you can get to use it aside\nAnd it's amazing to me that the same ... that has now come around to Elizabeth Warren is not a Native American\nBecause not well if you're session at American why didn't you Native Americans you should be\nShe's more Native American and Caitlyn Jenner as a woman\nSo what exactly is the problem here\nIt's truly amazing so you wonder why the right doesn't trust the media you wonder why people are resonating to the right it's because the ... insists that we absolutely politically ... bottom eyes ourselves\nOn basic concepts like what is a woman and what is a man and we're supposed to pretend it's a great evil when the Trump Administration says gender discrimination means discriminating against women not discriminating against men believe they are women\nIt's an amazing thing coming up I actually want to analyze the new law in the United states under title mine\nWasn't specifically met protect women or was it specifically mass protests feminine men or men who believe they are pretty obvious from Texas actually what
