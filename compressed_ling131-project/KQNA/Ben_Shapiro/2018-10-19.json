Shapiro show does the president of the United states that do they perform and that is a joke or a smoker midnight poker President Trump loves being in front of an audience and basically ... in a comedy routine which has its upside and downsides let the president doesn't rally like President Obama would go out and make some speech the president goes out there and he just rich for an hour\nAnd it's usually very entertaining in a lot of folks have been to President Trump's rally they say it's a lot of fun obviously the crowded there to have a good time it really is kind of half a political rally and half a comedy routine because from did I highly entertaining human\nWell sometimes that has upsides and sometimes that has downsides because like all comedians when President Trump gets ripping sometimes is good and sometimes he is just going to put his foot so far down his mouth and it comes out his call in and out his rear end and back around again\nSometimes decrease in Aurora boroughs of human physicality\nSo here's the good sometimes he President Trump used up like it's like there's this kind of funny so President Trump there is a woman in the crowd and you shop I Love you and he was President Trump's response\nWise guys the Democrats took turns I Love you too\nWho\nSaid that [noise]\nIt's finally a woman you know I get it from the middle of the\n[laughter] far\nEvery guy that said I Love you\nBut just not my thoughts\n[laughter] [noise] I finally earned it from a woman thank you\nThat's funny stuff that money and stuff and then you'll break that down all its effects and then it's beginning plenty okay that's a funny thing to say that the funny thing is that\nProblem is because the president is actually a performer you know Donald Trump they've requirement you spent an entire like being a performer as someone who performs on stage I Know what it's like you play to the crowd the crowd that's in front of you respond with cheers and they respond with food and they were signed with laughter and you're constantly trying to keep them and President Trump even said this when he was ... candidate Trump he would say that he can go to a rally\nAnd if he was on his stump speech and three quarters of the way through speech and people look for it would just start saying build the wall because it got people all jacked up what he actually said that he performs like a performer while the problem is that when you perform like the president\nDoesn't actually have a fully functional brain to mount filter like that filter is is pretty ... ... whatever star tear ended up here\nAnd it doesn't matter what started there is one of the ... is one of the good things about the president's why he's authentic why people like authenticity in politics\nReading his authentic feeling is because he's authentic in the same way the ... and a half year old is authentic she thinks that it comes out that's the way it is like there's no present that is good in politics because it's honest right you get the feeling and he's on an even\nLike even the stuff that Trump said that it is on its heels honest because he actually believe that it's not he wasn't at Trump is just going out there and he's lying aid for barricaded Donald Trump believed everything that Donald Trump said that doesn't mean everything that Donald Trump said is right or factual\nBut it is authentic so that the good side from the problem is sometimes the thought that go through the head\nAnd that happened yesterday um twice actually so he was talking about Greg ... who is the ... in Montana congressman and a and I guess in Fort was at this rally\nAnd the president decided you know it'd be a great idea to pray that time the congressman gene for body slammed her a poor so if you'll recall back in the ... campaign there was a situation in which airport confronted raging for like two nights before the election and general or got mad and he went full\nMacho man Randy's Abidjan where I went full undertaker he like grab them by the neck and blend into the ground and it's just caught on tape and then he had to plead guilty to a misdemeanor\nPresident trying to think you know what I'm In front of a crowd I've done that we do we need before let's talk about that thing you know this is an issue that really needs to be out on the table two years later let's do this\nSo here's President Trump and the only reason I was calling is because this is the world we have chosen this is a business we have chosen a time in ... says hey well here we can't go back what what are the chances that Trump wasn't going to mention ... body slamming a reporter is grudging Fort Hayes in front of them are the chances zero percent negative one hundred percent\nI'm just shocked and Trump has been ... national rally mascot\nDoes that mean that it's a smart move you know it turns out it's an unbelievably dumb move coming up on ... the president's\nBig move on with regard to Greg ... cutting his entire must be doing for the past three weeks with regard to democratic violent rhetoric they'll talk about that much will jump in the mail bag as well you're listening to venture bureau\nI don't think it's actual genius\nI always attribute to stupidity what I cannot attribute to mail it\nAnd I think what we're watching here as President Trump just saying stuff and then the media being unable to hold themselves back and saying stupid things in response to it\nBeing unable to hold themselves back and saying stupid things in response to do I think that this President Trump manipulating the media into being crazy no I think they're crazy and he drive them crazy and he's good at at poking them\nThey have a unique capacity to pull his chest knocked out of the fire he'll say something\nAnd then the media overreaction is so insane\nThey go well I guess I can say with those people do hear a CNN\nCNN host drawing a comparison and the link between President Trump praising ... and the murder of ... by the Saudi Arabian government you know stupid you have to be to make that link Saudi Arabian government has been murdering people since you know their entire existence\nThey've been murdering dissident and journalists for literally decades but it was only ... from\nWhat is going to know all his own truck came around this is apartments so knowing that the media yes from says bad things just want the world is also a rough bad place before President Trump was born\nAnd before he was president the world didn't start spinning the moment the trust President Trump was elected there at the end and hosts know trying to attribute the spike in treatment of bad journalists in places like Saudi Arabia to Trump as a Trump is dictator of Saudi Arabia\nAnd at that rally last night will play for you to president praised\nThe body slamming I Need a guy who can do a body slamming like that but why does it matter while you might think that assaulting a journalist and any circumstance is bad but remember this happens three weeks after the apparent murder in this member of ... of Washington Post journalist\nJim all ... and the president we should note acknowledged that it certainly looks\nLike this column is is this at the same time he refuses to condemn the Saudi regime for this ...\nOkay so if you think that President Trump is okay with the murder of journalists because he says something stupid about Greg Gen ... you\nKnow and if you think that President Trump is suddenly driving press members around the world to be killed it can get like the Russian government needed a cue from us\nI don't remember this sort of talk about President Obama when journalists were being killed all around the world under his watch and journals were legitimately being killed around the world under his watch\nBut because he didn't say this kind of public stop there was no linkage well there's still a linkage but ... says dumb things which is the obvious you know answer to do all of this\nThat and the worst example that came courtesy of Joaquin Castro one of the Castro brothers who wants to get who wants to run for president walking is just the other all the other one and nobody cares about that much and he was on CNN\nAnd he suggested that President Trump's administration had literally green let the ... by the Saudi Arabian government\nAnd then he was kind of using the gym forte commented at the evidence of\nThat let me go to the point that I think is most disturbing right now the reporting the jury ... may have with U.S intelligence delivered a shooting with an enemies with\nTo the ground for the NBA or Saudi Arabia and that proved that may have acted on that kind of one of the people that he took action against Mr 'cause soldier\nThat didn't happen Jared Kushner did not than a hit list to the Saudi Arabian government and tell them to go murder journalist there's no evidence of this and I like how Joaquin Castro says there's a rumor going around there was a rumor going around the Joaquin Castro just members babies and eats them in the backyard\nI don't have to provide any evidence for this rover is just a rumor I heard it around\nAnd ... this is why Trump will continue to win so long as people do not treat him with the proper level of objectivity\nAnd by the way I reject company does not mean moral center when he does that stop that means that if you respond like a duck to his comments than doubled down on you so in a second\nBut we're going to get to more of all of that but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like use of why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else healing sweet built asleep wouldn't take two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference it to the perfect mattress\nWhether you're inside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from it with the ... there's no we're

mattress we took that two minutes when quickly or than after it came in the mail man wrapped it inflated right in front of us we put it on the bad or good to go in and supremely comfortable and luxury mattress\nAt a non luxury price that he was sleep dot com slash a pure over a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or to once again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro use that flash of heroes and they know we tell you already do\nMeanwhile as the media continue to wildly overreacting blame President Trump for the murder of a Saudi journalist\nI Would like to make one note about this particular topic okay when it comes to the murder of the Saudi journalist a couple of things one the people who are most loudly criticizing President Trump for his treatment of the Saudi Government or people who are absolutely in the pocket of the Iranian its members in the the former Obama administration\nWho want in the middle east to be controlled by an Iranian ahead you're on spreading its power from Afghanistan in the east to Lebanon in the west and south Yemen\nIs Obama characters who are saying that Saudi Arabia has to be cut off by the United states now should there be serious consequences to an allies murder of a journalist of course there should be but I'm not going to take at face value the complaint from turkey an actual despotism ... arrested a hundred and fifty thousand dissidents in the last two and a half years\nI'm not going to take at face value their complaints about human rights and I'm not going to take at face value complains about human rights from a bunch of people who propped up and gave a billions of dollars to the worst human rights violators and dictatorship on planet earth outside of North Korea I'm not going to do that\nSo to think can be a short one donor journalist and there should be consequences and also that doesn't mean that we have an ... that we in the United states have an interest in undermining an alliance with the Saudi Arabian on behalf of the Iranians the way that the Obama administration wanted to do\nOkay you know what I I Can't handle the motions to mail back legitimate like okay fine you know too much too much of the art now that\nYou're that hey man who do you think is the favorite to win the demo twenty twenty democratic nomination in addition horse and people you think Trump would be handling election for some people you think he was troubled debate thanks and love the show okay Joe in the category of people he would be handling Cory Booker he would match up Cory Booker\nBy far the kids would go down harder than a journalist at the hands of ... the president would say\nCory Booker is mechanical an awful it's awful and his job he is a he posed as a moderate and he actually the radical leftists\nAnd he like Hillary Clinton he's actually like a bad version of a robot he's not even like a good like team on ... and from Terminator is like the early version that's bad out a lot it can it broke down on the battlefield\nHe's he's more like gizmo from some of those old series he he's he's not\nYou can you can see every geared hurting for Cory Booker a man who is very bad jobs at Trump would finishing because Booker is the most inauthentic candidates and ... terrible candidate\nI think that Trump would also want somebody like Eric Garcetti the LA mayor who pretend to be cool but it actually just adore so I think Trump would would destroy him pretty quickly um I think that the most dangerous candidate for him\nWould have been Elizabeth Warren and she didn't implode because frankly I thought he was a lot smarter politically than she is\nAnd I was shocked to watch her set herself on fire sending smoke signals to the rest of the world that you didn't know what she was doing and she sat there and center TB on fire and I didn't understand why she would do that but she's kind of taking herself out of the smart candidates circle I Would say right now on the top democratic contenders ... stole Biden because it's hard to this\nThe top democratic contenders most dangerous and still Biden because it's hard to destroy guy who's been in the public eye that well\nYeah well one of the benefits that Trump has is that everybody has an opinion on it which means that nothing that you say about him changes anybody's mind\nAnd you say that Donald Trump his dad with lemon everybody goes\nRight yep okay and you say Donald Trump says things sometimes that are really bad and the more like well yup women here we know\nAnd if you say that Donald Trump shot a man on Fifth Avenue we'd all be like\nWell I'd uh probably okay by like ... and he he really is right that was the truth thing from ...\nIn high name recognition and a history of skeletons in your closet means that it's very difficult to actually destroy somebody politically\nIf they've dealt with a skeleton in their closet in their obvious about it\nSo Joe Biden has been out there for a long time there is not a lot out there they didn't know about Joe Biden and they can dangerous also he does have blue collar appeal it a lot of the state that Trump won places like Ohio and Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that it's sort of Biden territory democratically thinking\nAbide would be dangerous candidate so when Trump says he was ... I don't think that's right Kamala Harris I have yet to see so Kamala\n... she is much better at this protein that Cory Booker as\nShe also happens to be somebody her downside is that she has that kind of\nAbsolutely clean cleaner than ... image and a lot of the public mind that changed the prosecutor hardness prosecutor asking a tough question I think when people start digging into queen characters in politics they don't stay clean for law and President Trump today master of throwing dirt on people's him he was just great at it so I I think he went there okay against\nKamala Harris okay let's say Joel said as the saying goes away till man tired it through his stomach what does your wife make it falls under the ... him any food that signal event\nOkay so I have to be honest about that my wife has called me three meals in the last ten years better because my wife\nIs a doctor that means that she was incredibly busy and she has not actually cooked meals very often at all early in our marriage the way to my heart was through boiling ravioli like it was literally that they just go to the store pick up some pretty baggage ravioli it was pretty spectacular whoever's that demands and the weight on as hard as through his stomach when it comes to your wife", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "19"}
