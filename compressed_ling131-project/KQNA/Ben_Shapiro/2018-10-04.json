I mean it really has been an evil profits in which heats engaged getting an allegation on July thirtieth holding it for six weeks ago just before the vote releasing it without any corroborating detail\nMay be releasing an anonymous linked in order to spur the full release of the story and then grilling Brett Kavanaugh opposes gang rape and all of this has been grown here at center Dianne Feinstein continuing her pattern of being rose by saying that the FBI investigation is complete and becomes incomplete therefore that's really why we shouldn't vote on Kavanaugh\nSo what I can say is it the most notable part of this report is what she's not in it\nAs we noted by the White House sci fi I did not interview threat Kavanaugh we have seen even more fresh reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but we're not interviewed\nOkay so I Love that she says what's most important here is what's not in it\nThat is true but not how she made it so she says\nWhat's most important at all the people you have to I didn't interview well that's because the people that you're talking about could provide no corroborating evidence was not in the report\nIs that there is no corroborating evidence for an ending up Christine Blasey Ford's allegation no corroborating evidence none that ... the Senate Judiciary chairman Chuck Grassley he says there's no hint of misconduct and confidential

Kavanaugh's accuser and the laws are looking at her\nShe is now coming out in the FBI investigation was surprise surprise incomplete\nHer attorneys who are democratic act that they send out a statement it said quote an FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview a doctor Christine Blasey Ford nor the witnesses to corroborate her testimony cannot be called an investigation wherever family disappointed\nThat after the tremendous sacrifice you met him coming forward those directing the FBI investigation or not interested in seeking the truth ... thanks one she testified under oath outlay there was no reason for the FBI to talk to her again if you contradict her stories you commit perjury\nThere's no there's really no reason for them to talk to her second\nThey talk to all of the witnesses\nThey gave torn statements and those witnesses did not back her story\nWhen they say that the FBI been talked into the witnesses who cooperate with that money there are no witnesses to corroborate her testimony and talk with one on the left that women would never falsified would never missed remember would never lie about allegations of right now\nTremendous sympathy for people who are alleged sexual assault I Do I mean when when she first came out I said this is a credible account and and I I Want to wait for corroborating evidence before I make a decision on that there is no corroborating evidence for coming and that's why I'm saying that Brett Kavanaugh tamped down the court I still don't know\nIf you're telling the truth you don't know either nobody knows 'cause there's no corroborating evidence and the witnesses\nWith that said one of the things that's been put out there by by talked on the left is that there's no incentive for women in high profile cases come forward\nI have two or three Anita Hill any of the hell is going to hear all on the left for the last twenty five years HBO made it both here is about her and if you think there is no incentive for women to come forward and shape the course of history\nI find that highly doubtful I mean here with time magazine cover this week or the time magazine cover this week is up Christine Blasey Ford swearing with our eyes closed and her entire faith is made up of words from her testimony\nThat looked like somebody who has not benefited at all from the publicity\nI Would say the ... one of the worship fingers on the left today so\nThat's not an implication that line but I think that the the incentives are stacked in one direction is just not correct\nBut just think that the the incentives are all in one direction is just not correct It's just not objectively correct\nAnd it's true that Brett Kavanaugh has an interest in her story not being true but you also have an interest that doesn't get that women don't have an interest in coming born in high profile cases because all they are going to get in the downside is just it's not accurate is just not accurate now again that doesn't mean she's manufacturing her case doesn't mean she's why but we ought to at least be honest about what the incentive structure is here our\nIncentive structure that are in place for allegations sometimes and you made\nIf they weren't then you wouldn't have high profile cases when women come forward and say something and it turns out that there\nSo that that has a point number one point number two there are a bunch of people who are now coming forward and making ancillary claimed to have nothing you're cabin and if it's supposed to be ... be great\nTo Bulger capital there was a piece in USA Today that woman was promoting on Twitter and what she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh getting angry in front of the Senate and the reason that you shouldn't be on the court to remember the original reason he shouldn't be on the court was that he was a conservative than the reason that he shouldn't be on the court is because he allegedly committed sexual assault that when there was no corroborating evidence\nYou shouldn't get on the court because he was part of an angry is one of the USA Today that I remember my grandfather and that's why Brett Kavanaugh actions that on the court\nWhat in the world is that a few with anything\nThat's like anything I was abused in high school by bowling Brett Kavanaugh as well in high school that means he raped and check and therefore I pose the nomination\nIf a bad thing happened in your life thanks to a person who is not the person we're talking about that doesn't mean that the person at issue actually committed a crime against a person who is not you\nIt's like I have a relative was murdered\nThat means that then you have committed murder of another person\nThere is no logic to that whatsoever first of all send you'll get away with it she very clever dastardly in fact in her cleverness\nIt's a nonsensical argument that's an argument that's been repeated we couldn't believe all women because something happened to me and because something happened to me I Believe ...
