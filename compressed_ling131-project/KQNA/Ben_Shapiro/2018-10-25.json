hot air right judging by ... by social media Glenn and a historian thought it was Clinton the explosive powder inside the bomb was harmless not sell\nA package and CNN and pain to pipe bomb in and on what with the mystery of powder inside and mystery of how to determine what the bonds themselves\nAre supposedly workable and functional it crude although there are other report that suggests that the bomb that lack of detonator and so this was either a test run or a hoax or something else like that we're still waiting more information and that is today awaiting more information\nYesterday I thought there were a bunch of folks who jumped to the false flag explanation now I'm not claiming\nThat you're not allowed to speculate inside your own head as to who you think of this or that you're not allowed to wonder whether there's enough information on one side or the other way I Am saying is if you are one hundred percent sure this is a false flag he went right there like right away he just went to this is probably the Democrats ...\nThat's not good okay you shouldn't be using confirmation by it and substitute for evidence and if it's true in so many cases in our politics I Can't even tell you I've been saying for years I mean\nI remember when Michael Brown case Michael Brown black guy shot by a cop an enormous law the entire law basically sat mitigate a police racism and brutality and like a man was shot in the back because he was black\nAnd I said well let's wait for more evidence and then the evidence came out and it turns out that wasn't the story at all or here if you were jumping through either this is Democrats' helping themselves or Donald Trump planting bombs in the mailbox CNN\nLet me think that you that you're totally full of crap you know I Know you don't know yet because no one knows yet I don't know yet you don't know yet I don't know yet and anybody suggesting they know who did this\nOr why it was done or what the connection is there any

I think he has used rhetoric without his political opposition at an immoral does that mean again he's inciting violence no and the press have used very similar rhetoric about President Trump does that mean they are inciting violence no it doesn't heated rhetoric and violent rhetoric or not the same thing\nAnd to link the two means that eventually somebody just going to say what kinds of all the rhetoric because otherwise it's going to lead to violence there was President Trump going after the media basically the media and President Trump can't clamoring each other and I think there's some truth on both sides and there's a lot of alternate both sides of the president saying that but the media scares\nThe media also has a responsibility to a certain tone as you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do [noise]\nI mean no I agree with the president that the media doing horrible job of covering the news and in response to President Trump they promote even more balls and more fake and more divisive politics that is what they do\nBut is there any question that President Trump is rolling them of course not because president from his use similar rhetoric about media\nBasically that just to folks slapping each other in the polling dynamite style in the face and then blame each other when a guy down the street decide you didn't go bomb the local school\nNot the same thing that you're gonna be ... I think much more correctly she said CNN is using to divide and attack\nPresident Trump asked Americans to come together and ten one very clear strong unmistakable message that act or threats of political violence Benny kind of no place in the usa you chose divide and attack America should unite against all political violence\nAnd that is correct that is correct and I don't understand why President Trump and getting back for saying the right thing at that at that rally or at the White House and then he is getting bashed on the other side when he when he goes after the media anyway in any case CNN demonstrating full scale\nThat they are going to go with the narrative but they never went with his narrative around a Bernie Sanders\nThan ever went with this narrative with regard to the\nThe attempted attack on Susan Collins but they are going to go full scale of these attacks on President Trump's here CNN's Gloria borders are saying you know Trump's targets in is it a coincidence President Trump attached to a bunch of people and then those people get ... bomb mailbox you know what we do in politics we attacked people on the other side and their and their ideas\nNow I'd had people on the other side all the time I mean I'm calling for a bombing of their house of course not and people will attack me online or not calling for bombing of my house but not a thing but he was more a mortar blaming from\nYou know ... and these are names as you point out that come up all the time in his rallies I mean he's not particularly kind to but with our co mama either so uh I I think it it would behoove tend to be a little bit more complete and when we say about this\nSo now we are going to conflate we're going to conflate President Trump ripping rock bottom with President Trump calling for violence against drop a bomb if that's the case in the un uncalled for violence against Donald Trump every single day\nComing up to CNN believe President Trump is responsible for the heated rhetoric that means\nTo violence but in and obviously doesn't have clean hands here either it seems like a lot of political poverty on both sides when the real war should be if I'm not fighting violence and not responsible for violence off about it and then you're on\nLashed out at president Donald Trump in a statement released Wednesday afternoon appeared jointly condemned the statement from the president you should earlier in the day expressing his concerns\nOver theories of suspected explosive devices sense a prominent Democrat thinking we listen with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people an editor first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reversed as his statements that can do an act of violence time and again the president\nHis statements that can do an act of violence time and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body plan reporter the neo Nazis killed a young woman in Charlottesville his supporters at rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder of their own citizens that are friends of the free press as the enemy of the people\nNow I think President Trump and a lot about stuff how 'bout that unclear about this but you're actually going to blame him for this bombings ... this is what you're going to do now\nI Do remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just a year and a half ago who was asked\nAbout Steve ... nearly being shot to death you own died okay he was in critical condition he almost died it's a miracle that he live here is Nancy Pelosi saying how dare you blame us or Bernie Sanders for heated rhetoric that could've been connected with the guy going on to a baseball field and shouting anti gun down members of Congress\nAbout health care and food is doing he was he was standing there screaming about health care while even tried to murder members of Congress there was Nancy Pelosi's response time she was right then she's not right now what the difference now she gets to target right winners\nHow dare they say such a thing how dare they are so sick individual\nDoes something despicable and it was horrible what he did hateful\nBut for them to all the sudden the sanctimonious and says they don't never seen such a thing before\nIt's just it's it's just amazing so she's worse I mean I Wonder what changed oh what changed as who was going to get one that's what changed so there is no such thing as a sword that cuts both ways all we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of ... my blood on one end directed toward you and sharp on the other end directed toward your opponent\nWe don't recognize that what we're actually holding it in a store and if you use it on your opponent can easily be turned back on you every store and has two edges\nBut according to the left it's just a habit and you can bury it in between the shoulder blades of your political opponents Hillary Clinton does the same thing so me former first lady senator presidential candidate sheets that wasn't as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nSay well as a person I'm great as an American I'm worried\nI worry about the direction of our countries\nI worry about what kind of world will be waiting for them when they're teenagers and young adults and beyond\nOkay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton thing that's our top aide Felipe brains who is really one of most vicious people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of this\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's Twitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his um betrayal\nOkay so next time somebody who's a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office one day to Fox News studio then I guess we can blame Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil with the other side\nIt is it legitimate like what's the date today today is the twenty fifth okay so what's your name at least twenty four ... fourteen days and they'll Fifteen days ago Hillary Clinton said that\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to\nRecognize and respect strength\nHey everybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap will get to the fullness of the crap\nIn just one second but first let's talk about what you do get ready every evening I loved the dollar shave has everything I Need to look feel and smell my best ... even more is the fact I never have to go to a store here think that stores have to wait in line you have to find the product you have to deal with human\nYes he doesn't make you do any of those things they deliver everything I Need right to my door and they keep me fully stocked and what I eat and so I never run out here's how it works dollar shave has everything you need to get ready no matter what you're getting ready for them that you covered head to toe hair products skin phase you name it they've got it and they have a new program where they automatically kicking stocked up on the product\nYou use do you determine what you want when you want to show the writing your door or a month to month once every six months\nI particularly like their ... delightful and keeps my skin silky smooth\nI also really enjoy their black pepper and stage shampoo really smells good plus with their hands him discount the more you by the more you say right now I've got a bunch of stars that you can fry for five bucks\nLike there are all haircut after that the restock box ships regular size products at a regular price so what are you waiting for get your start that for just five bucks right now a dollar shave club dot com slash than\nA dollar shave club dot com slash then again\n... everyone is all crap including\nAndrew Cuomo and bill de Blasio\nBoth of them came out and they said listen we have to turn down the temperature in this country and have to start at the top\nWeird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying the police officers were just shooting black and for no reason and I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York\nSo that everyone who disagrees with him on policy should get out of state but it's not an exaggeration he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage and his views on social issues let me explain if you are sitting around today and they're going it's always the rhetoric on the other side of this problem\nBy freaking mirror\nThat everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here\nAnd that also means that\nBlaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence is leading to a worst country\nIt's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence when they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric\nYou're actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you are eating everything up you're suggesting the other side is so evil at the very outer end of their ideas is likely to lead you to death and destruction\nThat isn't that an American perspective on American\nBernie Sanders' can say whatever the hell he wants no matter how wrong he is and the monkeys actively saying go should people on the congressional baseball field that is not his fault and Donald Trump can say whatever he wants and you don't have to like it or whatever Donald Trump said he has a right to say that so long as he is not saying\nGo beat up somebody right now go bomb some place right now\nIf I found weary of all of us just because I Am weary of all that really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation we're gonna have to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does a crazy thing\nAn office and I felt really really ... let's not making the country worst place and other new\nNBC News is actively hyping this Megan Kelly\nBlackface thing and it's really stupid it's really stupid so speaking of stupidity in politics to Megan Kelly we talked about the link yesterday Megan Kelly said on a show that she doesn't really understand why this woman who was in the real housewives of whatever\nWhy this woman was in trouble for dressing up as Diana Ross at a party because when she was a kid people used to dark and their skin for Halloween costumes and wasn't a big deal\nAnd a bunch of folks had well blackface has along in a glorious history in the United states that's insensitive said you know what I learned something today that's insensitive I was wrong\nThat seems like I should be an end of the story so that anyone really believes making Kelly's approval vicious are racist they don't actually believe that\nOf course nobody believed that nobody actually believed that Megan Kelly thinks black people are inferior genetically and black people are worse by people and morally culpable at a higher level than white people or any of that no one actually believe that that NBC and it just shows you that capitalism when used by bad people\nYou know is not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they tried to push Megan Kelly into a box that is not properly fitted for Megan Kelly Megan Kelly is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question\nEli Manning Kelly is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question and a former lawyer and prosecutor that is where her role as best they try to fit her into the Katie Couric wop wop morning news routine and that didn't work for them and so the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an inordinate amount of money and now they're trying to push out the door\nHow are they doing that by ... by ... racial resentment in the United states\nIn an ugly stop NBC News is now saying they're going to take the episode of making the show this week\nAnd they are going to terminate her contract based on her saying that she didn't understand what the big deal was about somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume\nThan anyone really believe that the NBC breath is really upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that this was the actually vicious brutal KKK style racism they would actually think that no of course not just NBC News trying to stoke racial resentment for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nAnd then the head of NBC News Andy lack overly ... into Kelly after she apologized ship apologized and then lack that there is no other way to put this but I condemned those remarks there is no place on our air or in the workplace for them very unfortunate\nAnd then left her whole cover her comments on NBC nightly news\nIt's an NBC decided to eat their own by going after making Kelly it's amazing how convenient that it\nI Know one on CNN criticizes CNN nobody on NBC News criticizes NBC News unless they are preparing to shop somebody up and throw them in the wood chipper\nAnd that's basically what NBC is doing here\nI Wonder why nobody trust me I mean this is it really is a great media story of just how corrupt the media are\nThere is no question that NBC is just attempting to claim that the soap to blame here in or is that they can make a move by making Kelly that they wouldn't otherwise be able to make contractually so well done over at NBC making the country worst place they can save the money on a hole that you yourself boxed in their own way coming up\nThe presidents of the United states is using his cell phone apparently in ways that exposed secrets of the United states to foreign eyes and ears if this sounds bad because it really isn't very good President Trump denied more so we'll get into all the details and the venture Russia", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott
