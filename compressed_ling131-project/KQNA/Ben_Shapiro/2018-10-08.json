as the ... bureau show tactic number one for the Democrats in the wake of Brett Kavanaugh data entry to the Supreme Court is well let's just try to change the system itself well you'd actually have to control the government to do any of those things and also that just to kind of works\nBut they never mind the tech and number two which is that women are suddenly under attack everywhere from everywhere one of the great life it's being perpetrated it's being perpetrated by folks like Valerie Jarrett Valerie Jarrett you'll remember what the top advisor to President Obama and she tweeted that that I think it sums up well the argument being made by Bill Charlap close\nTo all of the survivors of sexual assault and women wonder if they will be believed that they are attacked no there's a growing powerful movement of support there will always have your back\nWe believe you we will stand with you we will defend you change is coming\nTo the idea here is if you supported Brett Kavanaugh your nor and women who make allegations of sexual assault\nThat it's so transparent and it's really quite vicious and disgusting\nAgain oppose Roy Moore for the Senate in Alabama as a Republican because there was there a viable evidence that he had done bad things with young girls when he was a younger man\nI did not vote for president from in large measure because of his treatment of women\nThere are lots of people are not happy with sexual assault allegation\nSusan Collins the senator from Maine who came out in favor of Brett Kavanaugh is basically the deciding vote she's been ripped apart for what she had to pay on CNN but there's nothing innately wrong with what you said on CNN here as her explaining that while she believes something happened to Christine Blasey Ford she just doesn't believe that according to the proponents of the evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was that was the guy who did it\nI Do not believe that Brett Kavanaugh was her at the same line so I Do believe that she went to the south and I don't know by home and I'm not certain went but I Do not believe that he was the ... and ... ...\nOkay and that prompted Mazie Hirono to come out and say\nHow could Susan Collins down how confusing towns that was really funny because I remember that like a week ago literally a week ago there was one in Julie sweating it brought forward by my ... and she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh had gang raped her\nOr the he was involved in gang rape you never hear her name any more from the Democrats why don't they believe all women don't they believe that all women ought to be believed regardless of whether there is any sort of their Bible or corroborated evidence\nBut Julie ... she was gone\nSo not not believe all women it's believed the women who we want to believe because they're slightly more credible and then Republicans say okay well we agree the port was why the more credible than sweating it but we don't believe that she's totally credible either at least her stories and corroborated and then people are like no no no that means you don't you're not leaving on women\nRight but you don't really about women you don't really want you to Broderick don't believe Kathleen ... ugly Paula Jones you don't believe the waitresses were sandwich by Ted Kennedy and Chris Dodd back and then I ... it's just it's maddening but here is made you want to think how could Susan Collins even have a doubt\nHow could you even have because this is a free country where we do not condemn people without due process of law and we certainly don't condemn people's lives do the ash ... history simply without any corroborating evidence whatsoever\nWhat to say that the things that back and forth think that he wants to solve their water and food and then there was cooperation because he had talked about this thought to her husband to others before back half an hour every nominated to the Supreme Court took a lie detector test cover a similar there\nUp Mazie Hirono jet again this is built on the line is that we may have lost the battle with regard to the capital of winning the cultural war the cultural war is going to be that men verses women and women always must be believed and that men who do not buy in are women who don't buy in our guts lap using the system\n... toilets I'm On I was on meet the press so it was a mulatto shut up and meet the press after showing up at the hearing because of Dianne Feinstein has a very serious senator Leno and she explained were winning the cultural battle\nI think a lot of change but I also think a lot has changed and yesterday we we may have lost a political battle but I Do think we are winning a cultural battle and often I don't fight for them when I'm fighting for that generation\nI don't have to deal with the abuse of power that would that we've had to deal with\nThis is that this is what Democrats are hoping and they're hoping in the most ... why on possible way coming up a lot of folks in the media tweeting about how the United states than it is bad they jumped discovered checks and balances after a couple of hundred years what will they discover next\nHad just going to just going to say it's a bad idea\nAnd it doesn't make you a bad parents say job means they are trying to protect your daughter from the fact that there are dangerous people in the world and also because maybe your daughter doesn't want to look like effect object all the time and he doesn't want to portray herself defects object I like the feminist movement move from the correct opinion about pornography\nThat pornography was object vacation of women for the pleasure of men to pornography is empowerment of women\nThe empowerment of women\nYeah I'm sure that all those men who are in their basements right now watching Stormy Daniels all page are thinking about the empowerment of women they're all feminist that's what they're thinking right now\nBut I Love his women who show up at the Capitol where women for cabinet on T shirts probably tell their daughters but unless revealing closer though that as I say I also like the equation put on less revealing clothes at the same thing as we want to make you a nun now okay\nWhen did modesty become such a terrible thing I mentioned the amount of two by the way like I just but let's not pretend that men don't view women in sexual lives objects especially when women were aware of clothing that makes them\nMore likely to be viewed as such it's a free country can learn what you want I'm not saying you shouldn't wear what you want I'm saying I wouldn't I Would tell my daughter is that because I'm not the idiots okay here's a did this piece continues they're more sympathetic to Senator Orrin hatch of Utah who actually shoot away a crowd of women and told them to grow up\nRight because they were screaming at him like ... we played the tape on the show and then he told them to grow up and then they told him to grow up which was hilarious and she's one million years old or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who's response of woman telling him she was raped was I'm Sorry call the cops\nNot an improper response like I'm Sorry that happened to you\nMaybe you should talk to the authorities till we can catch the rapist and put him in jail is not a horrible response\nI liked it better when did that become a bad response like I'm just wondering what do you think Lindsey Graham is going to do\nHe'll grab a pencil and get somebody Sam and are going to lead them to a house is going to burst through the front door Lindsey Graham is going to burst through the front door it's like well\nYou have to shoot this fellow now because this woman without any evidence said that she was raped by you like that that's going to happen\nWhat do you think Lindsey Graham is going to say you don't want him to say you're a woman comes up she's I was raped you thinking what are you supposed to say at that point you know what\nNow that you told me you were raped Brett Kavanaugh's rape is what\nOkay this continues and we'll get deeper into the the insane\nMaze like mind\nOf the of the left on these on these women's issues and just one second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you to why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else\nHe'll sleep building sleep was they take two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep preferences for the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from bed\nWith helix there is no more guessing and no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes sleep was they will match Udall mattress that will give you the best sleep of your life\nFor ... he looked can even split the mattress down middle providing individual support needs and feel preferences for each side of a ten year warranty get tried out for a hundred nights risk grades are what are you waiting for their mattresses are so good that\nMy wife and I got one and then we loved it so much we got one from my sister for a wedding right now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all ... get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off at ... dot com slash Shapiro that feeling sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nFor a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or healing played dot com slash Shapiro these mattresses our top notch these are ruptured quality mattresses non luxury prices and you get a hundred and twenty five left off your mattress or when you go to Hugh asleep dot com slash Shapiro\nSo the rampant in mind loss that has taken over large swaths of left obviously is is being forwarded by their belief that if they just scream loud enough that how men are such that this will win out Alexis Cornell has a speech in the New York times we're going through and I think it's indicative\nOf a mindset on the left that it's pretty insane so here's the she's already accused women who supported by cabinet or any Republican\nOf being traders that these are the kind of women and we think that being falsely accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped the kinds of women who agree with President Trump that it's a very scary time for young men in America which he said during a news conference on Tuesday\nWell it turns out you don't actually have to compare that to being falsely accused of rape is pretty bad being falsely accused of rape does indeed ruin your life destroy your reputation destroy your family\nI don't know if you compare that to rape because there's no comparison like why don't I don't see the necessity of of comparing the crimes but being falsely accused of rape is a kind of a bad thing and then President Trump said it's a very scary time for young men in America that is a hundred percent true\nI don't know a single mom not a single mom with the boy was not worried about the possibility of where all of this is going\nEspecially considering the vagaries of the nature of content in our current political discourse\nWe're now living in a time when title nine charges can be brought against basically any man on any campus for any reason without any evidence and destroy the guy's life\nBut here's here's what is going to continue and the people would scare me the most are the mothers pictures in wives of the young men because my stupid uterus still holds out some insane hope of solidarity\nFirst of all I just would like to point out that this appeared in the New York times the most\nSolid paper in the United states according to ... and it printed a sentence in which a woman said that her uterus hold out hope\nYou would arrive do not hold out hope\n... are in Oregon so mean to say my appendix hold out hope\nIn case she says we're talking about white women the same fifty three percent put their racial privilege ahead of their second class and gender status and twenty sixteen\nMy voting to uphold the system and values only that white and it's just that they have for a decade\nOr white women put their femininity behind and they're not real women is where there's going white women aren't real women they're just white people they're just faceless nameless white people you know like these gender list which of whiteness ... since Nineteen fifty two white women have broken for democratic presidential candidates only twice\nIn the Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen Ninety six elections according to an analysis by Jane John\nA political scientist at ... University of Southern California women of color and specifically black women make the margin of difference for Democrats the voting patterns of white women and white men mirror each other much more closely\nAnd they tend to cast their ballots for Republicans the gender gap in politics is really a color line\nWell actually that's not really true the gender gap in politics is really a marriage line if you actually look at how single people ... percent how married people vote that's really the distinction married people tend to vote heavily Republican married women tend to vote heavily Republican single women tend to vote heavily Democrats are not about color and if I'm about ... it's very much about marital status\nWhy because when you have kids and you start thinking to the next generation when you start thinking what's the kind of society where I Want to bring up a family and when you start thinking you know I have a family unit that requires protection from an overarching federal government that wants to get in my grill\nWell that changes your mind a little bit\nBut according to let this go now it's all about the lightness that's because white women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their white nests to monopolize resources for mutual gain\nIn return their place on a pedestal to be cherished and revered as Speaker Paul Ryan has had about women but all the while deny basic right this is Jeff nonsensical it's just nonsense of I Know that first and Main white women benefit from patriarchy trading on their white noise to monopolize resources for mutual game\nFirst of all replace way with black in that sense and obviously it's racist but beyond that the idea that women are somehow trading on their sexuality in order to achieve some some decent treatment at the hands of the patriarchy this is all this is all crazy I'm Sorry this is all crazy stuff\nAnd if I urged Democrats to to run down the hill screaming it's like man she's as fast as possible please go do this make does your electoral strategy\nAlthough suburban white women who you're trying to gain and the next election I urge you to scream at them and tell them they're terrible people because they're white go for that let's do that\nIt's it's amazing it's amazing\nSo or ... or evidence she has\nDuring the twenty sixth in presidential elections in white women really vote with their white in mind Maury Frazier ... political scientist at UCLA\nRecently measure the effect of race\nRecently measure the effect of racial identity and white women's willingness to support Trump and twenty sixteen and found a positive and statistically significant relationship so white women who voted for him did so to prop up the rightness\nOr alternatively\nCorrelation does not equal causation because that basic mathematical statistical science\nIt it's in the study white women who agreed that many women interpret innocent remarks or access access or Seventeen percent more likely to vote for Republican candidate\nRight that makes sense because Democrats have gotten hysterical on that issue and they have decided that everything ought to be treated as right when Matt Damon suggested the debt that Ayman suggested there are gradations of sexual misconduct he was run out of town on a rail by folks on the left\nSo finally she concluded bloodbath between white men and women is an issue in the November midterms President Trump knows it and it that's used a news conference he signaled to white women do hold the line the people that have been complaining to me about it the most about what's happening or women women are very angry\nYes women are very angry many mothers many mothers are very angry and that crosses racial on\nBut this is the the the attempt militarized the me too movement which was supposed to be a bipartisan movement was basically universal support\nNo one wants to see women mistreated has now been shatter thanks to politics because the left decided that meat you any allegations that under me to any allegation brought against someone they like it's going to be ignored and any allegation brought against someone they don't like is going to be upheld\nThat's the way this now works according to the left to meet you broke on the shoulder politics because we were all on the same side with regard to all this stuff but no longer I Can't be on the same side of the people who want to do away with due process simply because they think that this is somehow going to\nEnable women to vote for Democrats not going to do that coming up\nThe craziest story of the day a former astronaut has now been forced to apologize for a great graves didn't what was that ten", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "08"}
