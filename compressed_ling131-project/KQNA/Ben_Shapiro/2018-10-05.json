have a great friday I'm DJ phone for the talk of the quad cities cage you in a streaming live cage when a dot com\nWelcome to venture parachute well a lot of news to get through today we begin with the fact that today the Republican pack a coach or a vote that Brett Kavanaugh's nomination will be voted on tomorrow the vote on Brett Kavanaugh was closer than expected and that is because of the\nPolitically trainers behavior or Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted no on culture Joe Manchin of West Virginia who wishes to retain his seat in the Senate voted yet\nThat means that it is now a bipartisan opposition because one vote is bipartisan opposition to cabinet and also bipartisan support for Kavanaugh because on one ... basically one ... one Democrat voted yes\nOn the public and voted no on culture but this thing is too close for comfort wouldn't have been nice right about now at the Alabama GOP had not nominated Roy Moore to fill a fantasy\nThat give me a little bit more breathing room I think I'd feel a little bit happier about life\nRight now so if I did to say the odds are very much I'm Brett Kavanaugh side in terms of being confirmed Jeff Flake voted yes on cloture Susan Collins voted yes on cloture in order for cab not go down right now basically both those people have switched their votes or Joe mansion switches vote between culture and a final vote the final vote\nIs designed to take place on Saturday that the that the goal it's supposed to take place tomorrow\nAnd we used to work out the obviously is in the crosshairs because Lisa Murkowski who lost a primary and twenty five and then won a write in votes and\nOne forty four percent of the vote in her election before that and twenty against the libertarian candidate should not wildly popular in Alaska or anything like that but you feel pretty secure 'cause she's not up for re election until twenty twenty two and now she got to\nBurnish her feminine bona fighting\nIt would not be particularly surprising if the Democrats at some point when the Senate than talking twenty\nIt would not be particularly surprising to have somebody like Lisa Murkowski switch to independent Jim ... with the Democrats in order to preserve her seat that would not be a giant shot so Murkowski bows the wrong way on that Susan Collins the right way on cloture she has in the past voted for cloture on particular measure it and then voted against the nominee if you work to do that\nIf you want to vote in favor of culture and then vote against the actual measure being taken then you would see if the tie in the Senate broken by vice president Pence which is about the ... mark and then you could put somebody on the court by but hey\nAlmost on the accounting horses and hand grenades and neither so as long as he gets confirmed that's all that matters in the end Joe mansion of course has a lot of pressure on him\nBut he also understand that if he votes against Kavanaugh he lose his seat he ended up for reelection in five minutes here and the folks in West Virginia are not going to go along with Joe mansion if he if he were to undercut Brett Kavanaugh on that matter all do in other breaking news this morning\nAnd this and then in the main story that underscores the vagaries of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh in the first place pristine blading Ford was the woman who made those allegations there's a new story from the wall Street Journal that is truly a shocking story and getting undercover and of course by a lot of folks in the mainstream\nThey're saying a lot of people and right wing media they're picking up on it everyone should be picking up on it because it's a kind of crazy story\nThere in the story from the wall Street Journal well a

of hero shouts out Democrats tried to say that judge Kavanaugh shouldn't be on the Supreme Court first 'cause you and the texture lead then 'cause he was an alleged rapist then because there's an alleged gang rape is everybody from either to do back in college then because he got angry when you've alleged that he committed rape\nOr that that is their latest ... one of the people pushing that stories John Paul Stevens a former Supreme Court justice thank God for the former\nAnd he said that Brett Kavanaugh's performance during Senate confirmation hearing suggested that he lacks the temperament for the job\nAnd here's what he here's what he ... he said at the time I thought have not had the qualifications for the Supreme Court trying to get elected I changed my views for reasons that have no relationship to his intellectual ability I feel his performance in the hearing ultimately changed my mind\nHe said that there's merit to the criticism that he has political bias and I'm thinking there's a lot this morning to the left and right have an outcry Brett Kavanaugh got emotional and Brett Kavanaugh as part of it I saw that today it doesn't matter even than with emotions and that are that he was part of it because he said the Democrats were out to get him\nOr alternatively Brett Kavanaugh was saying something that has implicitly true that Democrats were out to get him remember the original opposition Brett Kavanaugh and then he was attached to it and it became he was a gang rape is\nOne thing that you had spent the last forty years of your life in public service\nAnd that so many never knew\nHim for with an allegation against you accusing him of gang rape\nAnd the people who oppose you politically the same people who said that they oppose you because we were attacked your let's then came forward and said\nWe think that you are also a gang rape is might say wait a second this feels like a partisan hit job\nMight you say that or does that make it to park and it's amazing it really is amazing all the folks who say judicial temperament first of all these folks have never met a judge and there are lots of judges who are angry\nThere are lots of judges who have personality issues they did they do that all judges are sort of St ... on the hill who spent justice company appalled and three\nIt's just not true it's just natural but the question is you know temperament is how do you approach cases when you're on the bench so we have twelve years of ... fourteen years ago a Brett Kavanaugh on the federal bench while he was twelve years a wreck happened on the federal bench\nNo indicator that there was any problem with his judicial temperament and with a moderate moderate conservative on the bench\nHe went through a full Senate hearing you remember they remember there was a whole set of Senate hearings before this whole garbage news cycle yeah there's a whole set of Senate hearings where he went through silly questions from senators and you had the grandstanding by Kamala Harris and Korea potato head Booker\nAnd they went through the entire hearing and he was ... that right you wouldn't do that was the the rip on him he was to do it was too robotic\nHe would say that twelve years on the bench lasted\nA full hearing poised classes\nAnd then shockingly people accused him of gang rape and he got a little mad\nAnd then the oh my God how have you looked at that that's a failure of judicial temperament it turns out that people react differently to different stimuli\nIf you give me a massage that has a different thing when you walk in the in the back and I had with a two by four I react slightly differently\nAnd he massage may enormous too and I can send your touch and I'm probably going to be Plath and happy if however you crack me in the back of the head with a two by four I might be justifiably angry and I might be missed in up to turn around and ... o'clock it back in the face\nThat's what happened to write Kavanaugh but apparently that's no good at showing who Brett Kavanaugh it really is he wrote a piece for the wall Street Journal\nTrying to defend his behavior and apologizing for being too emotional I like that at the time he'll no apology to anyone on any of this none if I'd been Brett Kavanaugh and people would accuse me of that I Would have gone into that room and I said let me be clear I Want this read into the congressional record I'm willing to state I Want you to spell correctly\n... all the Democrats center is accusing me of sexual\nAssault on women I've never met\nGo F yourself and let me explain why I mean by yourself I mean I won't go perform an anatomically impossible function upon yourself in the back room\nWhatever wrestling mechanisms you need to in order to achieve exactly that sort of a ... and that's what I Would have said Brett Kavanaugh just went in there and he said you guys are part of Manhattan okay that that's a really nice way of saying what these folks actually are and what they actually did hear\nComing up Brett Kavanaugh you know the guy who was a real hot head can't be trusted and you just have a part of the ... he wrote an op ed for the wall Street Journal\nAnd the left wing that the court was going to be its final bastion of weapons and no matter what happens they can always count on the court to step in and defend left this policy priorities\nAnd for a long time that was basically correct\nAnd now it turns out the one Republicans want to restore the judiciary to its proper role namely reading the constitution as it is written as it was men\nThan the left as well hold up a second hold on a second that's why people are so passionate because let's face it nobody\nThat's why people are so passionate because let's face it nobody cares about the local dog ... re\nNone of us would have happened if we're talking about a branch of government like a bureaucratic branch of government nobody really cared about that\nThey care about the Supreme Court because they think the Supreme Court is important they only keep the only reason people think the Supreme Court is important is because the left has turned it into a political tool and has used it as a club to be senseless people who actually believe in the text of the constitution for the last\nSixty odd years fifty odd years ... years since the Nineteen sixties since maybe Griswold versus Connecticut although you can certainly the case of like ... and the court has outstripped its boundaries many times before that obviously Dred Scott ...\nYeah I I wrote my entire Harvard law school third year paper on the idea of the judicial review should be should never get her tail because the founders never intended for the Supreme Court to these superior political branch and yet that's exactly what's happened\nIn any case the passions were running high yesterday and today the Marco Rubio was talking about Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination in the halls of the Senate on the Senate Hart building and he was drowned out immediately by protesters because this is the way our politics goes now\nUm [noise]\nWe have one of the girls are where you know these are all different\nOkay and that's just that I mean that was a normal day for the center of had to be escorted in by police I Will note something remember that time when people said that the right wing was really crazy and really radical remember the Tea Party and twenty ten how dangerous the right when you know they never acquired police presence to escort members of Congress to and from things\nLet's be Frank about this I don't recall a Republican staffer ... ... members of Congress and released their children's health records what'd you say things that actually happened in intern for representative Sheila Jackson Lee tried to reveal senators children's health information\nThat's what he allegedly threatened\nAnd that would be Jackson Cosco twenty seven\nWorks for Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd protesters in the south of course Marco Rubio there was a protester breeding Joe Manchin of West Virginia they're going to try to do the same thing they did and Senator Flake button hold somebody in an elevator and then yell at them about how they obviously have women because they believe in due process events at was was kinda ripped up and down by the right the other day for a speech that he gave on the floor of the Senate and that's because people were taking one line\nKind of out of context when he said he would have preferred Amy Coney Barrett\nSo it I had my original was Amy Coney Barrett if you recall\nThe bottom line is that been tapped his voting for cabinet what the point that he made as this false dichotomy that's being drawn by the west particularly between this case in the me too movement\nIn which they say that if you support Brett Kavanaugh you therefore hate me too if you support Brett Kavanaugh's due process and presumption of innocence therefore he don't take women seriously he said that garbage and the nonsense and he's exactly right of course that's exactly right so sure I have left has been playing that anyway\nIn just one second but first let's talk about whether you're sleeping enough probably not maybe the region and not sleeping enough is cause your mattress isn't that great I Know you got that expensive mattress out there at the mall but\nIt probably isn't as good as an actress that you can get from he literally why because he would sleep personalized as your mattress able to sleep but it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sweet preferences for the perfect matter whether you're aside sleeper or hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from bad but he likes ... got to know more confusion\nJust go to ... dot com slash Shapiro take that two minutes liquid imagine to a mattress and then they send it to you\nAnd your and rapid inflation in front of you you toss it on the bed frame to develop\nMy wife and I had a he looks like met her we love it I bought one from my sister for her wedding is that good for couples you can even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals support needs and your preferences for each side\nThey've been ten year warranty you get to try it out for a hundred and ... you're not losing anything right now he lives is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders again a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro that she would sleep dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks rocker mattress order he looks weak dot com slash Shapiro All right you show\nThese protesters are not stopping their rating people like Joe mansion trying to button hold people and we'll see if the protesters have they retired impact tomorrow because this is a razor thin margin remember\nIt was eight fifty one forty nine vote that's if you want to include Democrat Joe Manchin\nRepublicans heavy to vote cushion here\nIf you imagine what it's which is about\nIf Susan Collins when he joined Lisa Murkowski there is no justice Brett Kavanaugh he goes down to failure\nAnd it's a disaster for Republicans in the bedroom because a lot of voters just say to their own party you know what you guys are awful go screw off just leap we're not interested in you anymore but this is the protesters sort of story\nIt is worth noting you know there are there was a lot of hold up today because President Trump tweeted out that some of these protesters are being paid and undoubtedly true there are a lot of these protesters who are members of groups that actually will pay you to be out there for the day I'm sure many of them are spontaneous it's not all of them I it is for the one of the women who button hold Jeff Flake in an elevator\nIs an actual democratic\nOperative I mean there's a person who works for a five oh one C. three Center for American democracy I Believe in that country is funded by George Soros is not the main ... people are saying oh ... what was that you George Soros and like the stand in for all human evil that George Soros is the guy who I really disagree with and a lot of ways I don't think he's a good guy per se I think he stood for a lot of bad thing\nBut you don't have to like you George Soros says the ... the guy is not the bogeyman but there are a lot of leftist protestors out there who had the orange paid for them by groups that are trying to astro turf that yeah that I think is eminently drove there was a protester I don't know about this protester Memphis protesters genuine rating Joe mansion\n[noise]\nDoing\nYour job killer how he's going\nTo vote and of course when he shouldn't say it I'm happy to listen to your stories and survivor also your corroborate of evidence\nThey it's amazing I there was an article in your car today or yesterday saying that rape does not require cooperation\nBecause most crimes don't require cooperation what the legal standard moved by that is that if I were to allege that I witnessed a murder hey there's a second witness that has to corroborate my story however you do need other evidence if I just say I witnessed a murder I Walk into a police station I say\nSomeone in this room this very room killed someone\nLet's say that I won't name names\nBut I if I if I Would walk into a police station and say that the police would say okay is there a body is there a weapon you have any evidence that this is someone dead it's someone I think you need cooperative but didn't evidence\nAnd you don't need to be a second person in the room for rape to watch it and then tell you yeah it was right\nThere has to be some sort of cooperative evidence which is why there's so many cases at the police simply does not take up because there is no corroborating evidence I ... and had a terrific video today about the number of cases of of sexual assault and rape that are either falsely reporter to miss remembered is not to present it somewhere between eight and ...\nIt depends on the metric that you're using\nThe the protesters also took over the Senate Hart building and uh you know hundreds of them taking over the very floors in the building I'm not sure why this is allowed frankly it seems like kind of a dangerous thing but there it was yesterday\nRight now I Will say that all of it is driving the most Republican unity I've ever seen my life and there's a new poll out that are ... thing is there's a poll about Republican email enthusiasm there was a gap in Republican female enthusiasm\nAnd what it shows is that the Democratic enthusiasm gap which was at a map that high in July there was a ten ... ten point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans signaled them or lectures were very important\nIt sound like the typical high eight ten point advantage for Democrats ... evaporated evaporated over two weeks\nBy the way it's not just a bunch of animated Republican women are not happy with it the great lies that women all women hate\nDrop the judge Kavanaugh and think that no corroborating evidence is necessary look at the look at this point at the ballot is the generic ballot among white women July twenty second the plot fourteen among white women September not ... by September thirtieth ... plus one\nIf for clean point gender gap among white women disappears over the course of these allegations and white women don't love President Trump they don't\nThey're not huge Republican van\nAnd that is because they're a bunch of people still having iota of sanity in this country and recognize you can't destroy people's lives based on non corroborated allegation coming up Republicans seem to have experienced a final\nImplant
