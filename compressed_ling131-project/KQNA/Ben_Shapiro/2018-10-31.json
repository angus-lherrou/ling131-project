I always say please don't just he's not going to listen but and this of course is not is not helping in any serious way okay well meanwhile there are a couple of other story that that we must comment on here so as I said long ago\nLive by the ... by the kind of Kanye West became the love of the right for the last six seven months after he started making noises about how he loves President Trump and he was wearing a mask I hadn't even saying that he was thinking freely all of which is totally fine but as I tweeted as soon as he started doing this live by the current age I by the county Kanye West is not a stable figure\nIs not somebody who decided to become a an ideological conservative after reading the combined works well enough Buckley in Russell Kirk ... is a guy who's ... says whatever is on his mind that day well that resulted in a reverse on Twitter yesterday he's not rejected President Trump or ripped into President Trump\nBut he started tweeting out about sort of his political leanings now is that I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most I support prison reform I support commonsense gun laws that will make our world safer and then he continued he said I support those who risk their lives to serve and protect us and I support holding people who misuse their power accountable\nI Believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents are fighting to protect their children from violence and war Calvin sounds like a stump speech and then he gets to the point\nHe finally he finally to eat out I introduce Candace Owens began to so and the the black conservative who was associated with with Kanye has moved to the right I introduced candidate to the person who made the logo and they didn't want their name on it so she use mine I never wanted any association with like that\nI have nothing to do with it so blacks it is a movement that that can that has been pushing and Charlie Kirk has been pushing to get black folks to leave the Democratic party\nAnd in announcing blacks that candidates suggested that the logo for blacks it was designed by Kanye West he obviously does not feel that way and he's upset about it and he pointed out my eyes are now wide open and now realize had been used to spread messages I don't believe in you\nAnd distancing myself from politics and completely focusing\nOn being creative so ouch and also out\nSo that's not good but when you bet on people who are not the most stable people in the world and you pretend that they are deeply stable visited they not unpredictable consequences I think it's fair to say that is not the least predictable consequence that has ever happened in human history\nFortunately that was not the story of the day the dumbest story of the day came courtesy of a guy named Jacob wall I mean explain the story to you in just a second because\nIt is too wild and ridiculous for me to forego\nUndone of all that well it's got that in just a second but first let's talk about the fact that at some point here we are all going to plots if he ever faced up to that reality because it's uncomfortable and therefore you haven't gotten a

was this crazy story\nAbout folks who are trying to think Robert Mueller they're very upset with Robert Mueller and they believe that Robert Mueller is somehow it deeply compromise housing compromise well he's compromise because investigating Trump and therefore there was a scheme to find women and pay them to lie about being sexually assaulted by Robert Mueller\nI kid you not according to the Daily Beast and skiing became public on Tuesday\nWhen Robert Mueller staff on only after the FBI launched an investigation into the matter for weeks and it's been simmering below the surface but numerous reporters haven't been tipped off by a woman\nWho claims you even approach with promises of cash at the center of the game is publicity hungry Republican lobbyist Jack Berkman who's repeatedly dabbled in Internet conspiracy theories in the past including promoting the idea that murder DNC staffers that rich was killed by deep state government operatives Berkman denied involvement in any attempt to pay people to frame or its use Muller\nBut he also claimed his witnesses were going to expose the special counsel as a sexual harasser you scheduled day Thursday press conference a Holiday Inn\nIn northern Virginia to introduce his first accuser number one if you ever are are attempting to\nLaunch incredible fashion some sort of accusation you should upgrade from the holiday in just a recommendation like here we are in the parking lot of motel six\nBoys always left on for you and good luck with that not the part that is a Bergman says we're gonna prove that Robert Mueller as he drunk and it sexual abuse or\nYeah sure you are but that's not the part that's about the best part\nIs that Berkman apparently hired I I he hired a in hell agency in intel agency that was that was supposed to investigate Robert Mueller and his efforts to dig up dirt on the other Berkman appears to enlisted outside help\nJacob wall is that right wing put her personality who is treated inane things for years about mad mad that President Trump he's a self described printed birth and he said Berkman had told him he'd hired Matthew Cohen who claims to be a managing partner at the private investigations company surefire intelligence to assist with the investigation\nOnly one problem who is Matthew calling who is Matthew calling Matthew calling as it turns out is Jacob all okay and Jacob all apparently set up a bunch of fake\nLinked in accounts for people who worked for surefire intelligent by grabbing all these just random pictures from the Internet and using them as employee pictures for his business so for example he ... he said that the an investigator with named Donald free horn\nOkay they stopped photograph of an actor and he just use that and then when I was in the ... and then the Tel Aviv station chief he called the Taliban have\nOnly one problem that's a picture of verify Eli the and the Israelis supermodel so he he he went through all this trouble I feel bad for him all that he went through all this trouble to create a fake business to hide what he was doing from the government and then he went\nAnd got pictures of actors and use them as his state employees he financial investigator a surefire intelligence it's supposedly a guy named Simon Fred who's having pregnancy a picture of Christoph Waltz Supreme salad higher there [laughter] [laughter]\nI got the guy from a glorious bathrooms you get a financial investigator insured by our intelligence pretty ... I mean first of all and in Inglourious Basterds does have a good record and fracking people down but I mean my goodness apparently the deputy director of operations for sure fire intelligent does Dr Mike Harding of the first Baptist church of Troy, Michigan so well done\nThis is the best part of it is that ... was asked about all that and he denied all of it and then it turns out that he registered the website under the name ... under the phone number of his mother this is what the Daily Beast and sang up the fight to say our politics is too crazy people have been driven\nAnd if I could say our politics is too crazy people have been driven out of their mind short buyers website domain data list an email address during walls name and then of a legally suspect financial firm he held next management or fires let's say also contains images applauded the same Google Cloud account\nWall landed at the mall or investigations on Monday Night night any involvement\nIn or knowledge of surefire he said he works for an influence marketing company in LA yeah turned out that I'm not too much so yes things are crazy out there and everybody needs to calm down now\nThat did not end the crazy yesterday there was a lot of great yesterday my favorite bit of crazy actually was not even that it can hurt if you have Joe Donald is late breaking crazy last night Joe Donnelly is he Democratic Senate candidate in Indiana the current senator in Indiana and he was in a debate and he started trying to describe his yeah\nUm it didn't go well here's a Joe Donnelly had to say\nOr state director is Indian American but he does an amazing job or director of all constituent services she's African American but she doesn't even more incredible job then you could ever imagine but\nHey I wasn't aware that that that that day [laughter]\nAnd finally had called them back here exactly would that mean she's an Indian American but she doesn't incredible job you know like I'm like the other Indian American by my state director of grassroots operation is black but she does an incredible job now imagine our Republican but that headline ever stop no that would never stop ever ever ever ever\nBut that's the way that does work now is that Democrats can say the most absurd on their face stupid ridiculous thing and get away with it but you have to enjoy I mean that if they pull on Michael Scott fail or at the office style Michael Scott failure\nSo well done well done Democrats just amazing so okay so coming up Dr phil had on some folks to talk about micro aggressions and white privilege and all sorts of\nSilliness and suffice it to fade to study that he did on the air actually proved the opposite of what I think he wanted it for I Will show you why in the back of", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "31"}
