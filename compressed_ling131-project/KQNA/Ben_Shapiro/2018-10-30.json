com\nWelcome to the bench bureau that a lot to get to today I Want to talk about the nature of anti Semitism the relationship between rhetoric and violence but we begin today with the president of the United states make them kind of a shocking announcement he says he wants to push for an executive order that would outlaw birthright citizenship\nAnd the president of the United states has announced that in an interview that he is interested in signing an executive order that would end birthright citizenship or illegal immigrant children so here in the way the law currently operate\nIf you come to the United states for virtually any apartment or a foreign diplomats you come to the United states and you have a baby in the United states that baby is automatically a citizen of the United states entitled to all rights and privilege it can burn upon all citizens of the United states\nThe reason that there's been a controversial issue is because nothing in the constitution actually said that the ... not only does nothing in the constitution actually said that this is the case\nThere's pretty good evidence that the frame or the fourteenth amendment had no intent to do anything remotely like it suggest that just because you come to the United states and then you have a baby hear your baby is now in the United states citizen\nAnd that does have some pretty significant cost involved right now you have in California in many stories about that you've had situations where legitimate ... birth tourism is happening people are traveling through the United states just to have babies in the United states that their kid become American citizen and\nThere's nobody significant impact the center for Immigration Studies which is very anti illegal immigration\nAnd they estimate that between three hundred and four hundred thousand children are orange legal immigrants in the United states every single year meaning one out of every ten birth in the United states Sunni legal and grandmother all of those children are considered by the executive branch US government the U.S that have been enjoying the same rights\nAnd privileges at the children of us that isn't the population of U.S born children with illegal alien parents has expanded rapidly from two point three million into thousand three to four million in two thousand eight and that does not include children who are Eighteen years of age or older the actual figure it's actually somewhat larger\nAll of the benefits that are available to American citizens are obviously available to these American citizen there's a lot of talk about illegal immigration not having a tremendous impact on the American economy\nBecause he legal immigrants are barred from federal welfare for example their children however are not and this does lead to chain migration\nBecause children are now us that have gotten that can sponsor their parents for the United states citizenship the center for Immigration Studies suggest\nThat many of the welfare closet so jaded with illegal immigration are due to current birthright citizenship policy they take greater effort barring illegal aliens from federal welfare programs not reduced cost because the kids are still American citizen\nNationwide forty percent of the illegal alien hydra headed households\nReceiving some type of welfare in some states the rate is higher in New York forty nine percent receive welfare and California forty eight percent only Nineteen percent households headed by native born citizen make use of a major welfare program in other words\nIllegal alien who have Americans will children are taking advantage welfare and exorbitant rate and states offer additional welfare benefits as well this is all according to the center for Immigration Studies again\nThe LA county supervisor estimate that illegal immigration and birthright citizenship cost taxpayers in the LA county over a billion dollars annually not including education costs a lot a lot of money if ... percent illegal aliens and their U.S born children live in or near poverty and again\nThan these kids are able to sponsor their parents for residency in the United states there's a lot of talk today about\nFor residency in the United states there's a lot of talk today about this race it this is the Trump Administration\nTrying to simply by people who are differently colored from coming into the United states know there are serious economic costs associated with low income people and lo and poorly educated folks who are illegally immigrate ending illegal immigrating to the United states coming here having babies there can become citizens\nTalking about what exactly is that what that means for president from wild land Ventura\n\nFolk life insurance isn't the most

Supreme Court\nThis case basically was about whether the state of packets could you not educational benefit to children of illegal immigrants so kids were born in the United states they were the children of illegal immigrants and the question was do they actually have to be given free public education at the cost of the state\nSenate factors that now the Supreme Court said yeah excuse or the left that left the Supreme Court there's no evidence that this is really accurate by the the good ruling\nJustice William Brennan a very leftist judge wrote in a footnote quote no plausible distinction with respect to fourteenth amendment jurisdiction can be drawn between resident alien she's entering into the United states was lawful and resident alien to the entry was unlawful well\nThat obviously is bull crap okay we make distinctions along those lines all the time all the time we are constantly making a legal distinction between resident alien who came here lawfully in resident aliens who came awfully like for example if you're a resident alien you came here ... we can deport you\nEnter America law if you're a resident alien came ... we cannot departure you under American law at least not without some sort of violation\nSo this is simply a nonsense opinion now just because it's nonsense opinion does not mean and it does not have some sort of legal standing a duck\nAnd the fact is that there is legal standing for for ... versus do but that means that when President Trump that that he can simply issue an executive order and overall that Supreme Court ruling or overrule the federal laws that have taken that have taken that than in\nA in in order to ensure the quote what rights of of children of illegal immigrants that not correct\nAn act of Congress might be able to do it maybe not in any case it was going to go to the Supreme Court and that's really what this is all about President Trump\nWas going to sign an executive order and then this was going to be litigated all the way to the top of the Supreme Court at which point the Supreme Court will would rule and all this now\nIs really going to do all of us\nWho knows and when I see folks on the left are very very upset about Trump talking about executive order this way I don't like executive orders this way either I don't think this is what the executive branch should be doing the executive branch does not have the power nor does it have the capacity to rewrite laws or rewrite the constitution I felt that way about Iraq Obama\nRewriting laws to simply jets was not going to prosecute illegal immigrants and I don't like it when President Trump says he can rewrite the laws with regard to birthright citizenship from the office of the presidency the president is not a king executive branch is not a monarchy what is this really about what is that the truth that the president\nIf he wants to pursue something like that she does have a Republican Congress you could push Congress for a law\nHe he doesn't Republican Senate you could push and Senate for la ... is really about joining up to date\nIn advance and they're twenty eight you know watching and tied into\nWhat President Trump key argument has always been with regard to immigration on all the way back twenty ... twenty again which is that we are far too night about illegal immigration in this country now there are a lot of folks are suggesting that his red red with regard to the caravan is over the top\nIn some ways it's accurate and it's just not I wouldn't be as far as I can do about the president and his critics when it comes to his treatment of this migrant caravan\nThe migrant caravan is indeed a publicity stunt I mean there's just no question about what it it it it's being promulgated inflection\nFight Central American Latin American government being pushed\nBy the government of Mexico which is allowing migrant caravans travel toward the United states or when the president that these are not those who are eligible for asylum he's basically correct asylum is where people are being targeted by government is not or economic migrants who simply want to cross over in the United states in order to take advantage of the economic benefits\nOf living a rich and powerful country that that it didn't invasion it's not an invasion when you walk up to a point of entry and ask for asylum and the overall rhetoric with regard to illegal immigration\nIs not useful you can even oppose birthright citizenship unconstitutional and and moral ground about what you shouldn't do is suggest that the United states is in imminent doom and peril from a thousand people are walking up the point of entry at the southern border because that does re capitals in a way\nThat seemed inaccurate but we need to be at least somewhat circumspect now we approached these issues even though I'm generally on President Trump's died\nOf the legal immigration issue\nSo coming up let's talk about the rhetoric surrounding\nUs migrants hair of and then left has made the case that\nPresident Trump's rhetoric on the migrant caravan is what drove the shooting at a Pennsylvania a minute we'll analyze that might and talk about the relationship\nYou know when Kass on in your piece for Bloomberg today and what you said that Trump's hateful speech raises the risk of violence\nIt the the one sided focused on President Trump's speech as opposed to the left speech is counterproductive if we want to say let's all take it down\nIs counterproductive if we want to say let's all take it down let's all take a ... ... I agree with but if you want to say that from his uniquely responsible for the tone in general American political debate right now\nThat's just not accurate it's just not accurate and you know it's not accurate\nI mean would you mentally and the last twenty four hours a Republican Party headquarters and blues your county in Florida the the windows were shot out here's footage from that\nJust walked in they come in through the back door and they sell the windows and\nDid not have time at that point to look around\nAnd then um I didn't realize there was\nGunfire but there's one bullet holes in our windows and therefore bullet holes in the building\nOkay so the idea that violent rhetoric is only happening on one side is just a lot there's another problem with suggesting that rhetoric is is deeply connected to violent and that is he compulsion censorship\nSo there is a threat in saying that rhetoric is directly connected to violence here is a threat the threat is that people will then say okay let's restrict the rhetoric was restrict the rhetoric and that the move is being made in for example Europe is being made I'm right now I'm In broadcasting from Vancouver it's a move is being made in Canada\nIn Europe and there's a case has been wildly under Under Cover in Europe there was an amazing amazing case in which a woman was fine for criticizing the prophet Muhammad\nHey this is this is the need description of the case\nFrom the Atlantic ram would write a few years ago I appear in alive Egyptian television show hosted by a conservative Muslim with the hottest sympathy he learned early on by offering to answer any question I had about Islam including needs that whether the president ... what what are the prophet Muhammad was a child molester\nSeemed awfully open minded I talk in the house humorless jihad and tend to be a non profit when the lights went out in the program again I mentioned the travel Esther issue those remain true to his word that diversity interaction or chiding me from my apartment\nAround the same time a woman referred to as ... was convicted in Austria for in fact not raising her identical curiosity in the form of question on Thursday the European Tour of human rights upheld or two thousand eleven conviction for disparage meant a religious precepts a crime in Austria\nThe fact well yes it or not in dispute she held seminars in which he presented her view the Mohammed was indeed a channel after dominant Islamic traditions hold him on his third wife I ... I was sick at the time of the American nine at his confirmation Mohammed was in his early fifties\nYou offering woman repeated these claims the Austrian court rules you had to pay four hundred and eighty year old or spend sixty days in jail and he eats EH are ruled Austria and not violated her right\nThis is the consequences of restricting beach because you believe that speech either lead to violence is violence\nThere are consequences on the other side of this question it's not all about\nRhetoric and violence are connected therefore take down the rhetoric there is a problem with the rhetoric and violence are connected and therefore we must restrict the rhetoric supposed to be very careful about what it is we are calling for here\nWe have to be very careful because we're not careful than the impact of that is going to be a lot worse than the actual disease itself\nOkay in just a second I Want to talk about anti Semitism about the media's radical rhetoric we didn't get to all of that in just one second but first let's talk about your underwear do\nFall is here and you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is the perfect time to upgrade a restock their drawers and the owner of all colors in print from time to time and these are the best underwear in the business Tommy John obsesses over every little detail on stage\nThey used proprietary fabrics to perform like nothing about the war before as a result ... men and women's underwear sport in no guarantee what helped me in high school\nComfortable stapled way stands and a range of fabric federal jury leech off the other like moisture wedding ... what do you not against that means no bunch and you know riding up\nTommy John instill confidence in their underwear that if you don't love your first pair you got a full refund with their ... everywhere or it's free guarantee so what do you have to lose that include their new life changing women's underwear which is now fully back and stuff\nBefore you spend another time on cheap heat trapping multi past underwear remember there's no better way to take care of your good Tommy John doe just many didn't hurry over to Tommy John dot com right now you've probably been for twenty percent off your first order\nAs prominent Cuban or twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com\nI Love it these underwear you will do and again there's no risk because they've got that that's very level whereas free guarantee Tommy John dot com I Want to talk about the polarization and I'm One of the reasons that lying about the level of of rancor on the other side well whitewashing yourself to a bad idea\nI have to get right to have a kid who's boy and a half to get his two and a half four and a half year old\nIs just a wonderful beautiful girl she definitely has herself the two and a half year old has now decided he's had enough and so he's going to harass her every waking minute of every single day and we as parents have to decide exactly how we're going to treat that now the easy response\nIs it when he pushes her and she screams in his face which is basically every hour or two in our house right now\nDo I simply put him or punish are also\nThe answer is what I Do they paid him you need to go aircraft right now\nRight you get a timeout you're not allowed to put your sister said her Leah\nWhen you have a problem I Need you to come and talk to me about it I Need you to I Need you to actually talk man standing right here you don't need to scream and his face there is not the ... to ... to ... which you can appeal and screaming in his face or pushing him back is not the proper solution to this I'm now is he more responsible and she is you but of course you are a horse yet right he's pushing her\nBut that doesn't mean that you get to act like rats and get screaming his face is pushing back and get to do any of those things right now in American politics here's how things are going\nPeople on the left see themselves as my daughter\nPeople on the right you don't tell my daughter everybody feels like they are being pushed by the other side and they feel like it's okay to screen back in that person's face nobody is saying yeah I'm being pushed by the other side and that's bad but also I shouldn't screaming anybody they can put it that maybe what I should do instead is appealed to the broader moral authority of the American people and not act like that\nYeah that the media have been saying for a long time President Trump needs to stop saying the press or the enemy of the people that President Trump I got a lot of blowback yesterday tweeted out at President Trump should not say that the media are the enemy of the people a lot of folks on the rise in internal means the fake news or the enemy of the people\nI Would buy that narrative except that President Trump has never been very clear about what constitutes the fake news now there's some I think is that news that there are people who are quote unquote journalists who are actually just opinion makers\nThere are actual headlines that are wrong that stuff is big news but the president has been a blender ... and his use of the term fake news there is a poll he doesn't like it's fake news if there's a story that he doesn't like it is fake news he's never actually been very good about objectively saying what is fake news and what is not I'm not going to buy that exact excuse\nThe ... though they know the president shouldn't say that Trump atrocious and say that the press or the enemy of the people\nThat is true also true the media should not portray President Trump as the enemy of the people which they have been doing literally since the day he was elected and before they say he's a Russian agent they said that he's a traitor to the country they say that he's doing all of this for his own personal enrichment without any evidence to this point\nThey have all of these things and then they think OK well our hands are clean our hands are clean and you can see the sort of attitude\nYou want to know what folks are angry at me on the right to one of the reasons the folks are angry at the media on the right here's Jim Acosta\nGoing after Sarah Huckabee Sanders on his face to\nFrom which outlets are you in the president's\nOrder as the enemy of frozen is going to say the fake news media or the enemy of the people\nWho were just saying there is to say that there are some journalists some news outlets in this country for the Mesa characterization ah should you have good service they were shot when we're journalists\nThese are just they were ... were were journalist or the other people\nOkay and really what you should say is I mean what Trump thanked is huge because that's what the obviously running through his job candidates had just stuck between a rock and a hard place because at the press secretary you don't want to start labeling people enemy of the people it's wide Trump shouldn't be using the phrase\nBut if you're talking about fake news right I mean I think Jim Acosta is is not a good journalist I think just as effectively speaking as I can be I think Jim Acosta loved him some kind of Costa ... seasons of an act\nThat's more than a journalist and it's obvious to everyone CNN then tweeted out or in response to tear up a ... who said that the that\nUm job when she said you guys are polarized debate because you're suggesting that President Trump is responsible for shootings and bombing\nCNN communication that no press secretary in and did not say Donald Trump was directly responsible for the bumps into our office by our ... support we did say that he as you should understand words matter every single one of them but so far you don't seem to get to capitalize on CNN has been saying for a week\nFor a week that Trump should be taken responsibility for the money\nYou know I read you the kind of runs like last week\nFor a whole segment and and and then host people like Julie ... is the radical journalists political journalists from GQ who went on CNN yesterday and then said that Trump radicalized more people than ISIS does\nPresident has radicalized so many more people than I ever did I mean the way he talks the way the way he is that just it really hit harder the way the way that he uh allows the way he wink and nod to these groups the way he says I Know I'm not prohibited\nAnimal what she says right there isn't the only thing she actually had to come back and clog apologized for let's not pretend that the heated rhetoric and the escalation of moral ... on the other side that hadn't taken place on both sides you absolutely have coming up\nThe ... been a shooting in Pittsburgh ratings and serious questions about anti Semitism like what is it how do we analyzing how can we fight I think there are a couple of different views of anti Semitism and we need to actually examine those but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "city": "Prescott
