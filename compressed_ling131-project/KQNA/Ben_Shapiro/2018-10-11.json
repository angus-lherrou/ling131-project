Shapiro shouts out the less eager to show that they are not engaged in my operate have decided that instead of the reason people are angry is because they're white\nCharles Blow was aptly named over at the New York times he has a column today called white male victimization anxiety\nAnd here's what he said he says during the swearing in of justice Brett Kavanaugh on Monday Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to cabinet and family\nAnd a half our nation that he terrible pain and suffering you've been forced when your repeated the tire line that he and Republicans hope will stick and you're the common touch base with electoral fervor that accusations of sexual assault against cabinet or part of the campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies interception\nThey were and what happens in the cabinet family by like every notion of fairness decency and due process it did but here's Charles blows perspective to me\nThis was not just the president and party worried about and approaching blue wave and trying to take lyrical advantage of a moment to victory it was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome that have consumed modern American conservatism rocks and called it the unleashing of white male backlash\nThis is very bad by the way white males are not allowed to defend their right if they do this is just evidence that they are privileged so if white males are given due process than that showed that privilege and if they're not given to profit and then they get angry that also shows that they are privilege\nSo just like every other major left his argument these days the conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nAccording to Charles Blow the woman accusing the white man of assault learnt the victim\nInstead the white man was the victim well to be accurate the actual accusation\nIs that the women at using the white man of assault and had any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever in some people's eyes as low he was the victim of political correctness meet you over age a check and white male privilege culture drunk on its own self righteousness\nWhich has own which is true because that's what happened but that's not really what this is about according to Charles Blow\nKavanaugh's belligerent defense and Trump's dismissal of the accusers he mocked one at a political rally in called the accusations you'll recall that some folks like me criticized that and said that he shouldn't have mock Christine Blasey Ford because he didn't know that back either\nAccording to blow they represent for many many back against the wall no more space perfect moment to fighting back uh pushing back a standing proud in their patriarchy and proclaiming that it will not bad\nNow due process is patriarchy now production of innocence is patriarchy\n... they're saying enough they will be no or ground they will sharing or power they'll accommodate no more ascendancy and validation of the press\nNow you don't want to add the word allegedly oppressed there because again none of those allegations had actually been supported by any evidence\nThat is what they're telling us and they are speaking through truck\nHe says the victim sensibility Trump is articulating is not generationally restricted\nIn January a P. R. R. I. MTV poll a Fifteen to twenty four year old ... forty three percent of young white men say discrimination against like is this your is a problem as discrimination against other groups twenty nine percent of young white women agreed with him and nearly half believe efforts to increase diversity will harm white people\nBecause by nature the definition of the ... attempt to increase diversity include harming white people meaning what the last one from diversity is not ideological diversity or diversity of experience what the what that is that we should give slots\nThat belonged to qualified white people do on while if I'd non white people is an actual point that the ... believes it\nI don't even know how to what's going to argue this particular watching it doesn't make any sense if you are saying that there is a group of college admissions I watch too many are white and when you play some of those white people with non white people\nHow does that not harm laypeople you have to explain that one\nAnd as for the notion that discrimination against whites in that jury is a problem as discrimination against other groups there are two ways to read that question and I think that there's one ... to say that historically and presently discrimination against black folks is just ... it is\nNot as bad as discrimination against white folks which I disagree\nAnd then there was a way to rate which is that as a whole the left is interested in stopping white did\nBecause they think that there is a a patriarchy that must be punished\nAnd patriarchy has to do with the color of your skin and therefore if you are white you don't get to profit that part's true coming up we'll conclude that\nColumbine Charles Blow and then we'll get into a deeper question the question of political correctness and whether American really good morning or not to mention Russia\nAnd here is what they find\nAccording to the report twenty five percent of Americans are traditional are devoted conservative and their views are far outside the American mainstream some eight percent of Americans are progressive activists and their views are even less typical by contrast two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either it's\nBy contrast two thirds of Americans who don't belong to either extreme constitute an exhausted majority\nAnd that would be most of us and the traditional devoted conservative and I think I Would also probably be a member of the exhausted majority their members share a sense of the tea with our polarized national conversation a willingness to be flexible and their political viewpoints and a lack of voice in the national conversation\nMost members of the exhausted majority and then some dislike political correctness among the general population ... eighty percent eighty percent believe political correctness is a problem in our country\nYoung people don't like political correctness Seventy four percent between twenty four and twenty nine Seventy nine percent under age twenty four\nThe walk or any clear minority across all ages\nRace is also a bad proxy\nWhites are less likely than average to believe political correctness has a problem less likely\nAge ... percent of Asians think political correctness is a problem eighty seven percent of Hispanics and political correctness is a problem in eighty eight percent of American Indians think political correctness is the problem\nI Love that one ... year old American indian and Oklahoma said that well it seems like every day you wake up something had changed you said you are Jewish and the black guy African American you're on your toes because you never know what to say some political correctness in that sense it's scary\nThe only part of the standard narrative but the ... data partially from is that black folks in the United states are more likely to support political correctness by three quarters of blacks still opposed political correctness\nSo it turned out the vast majority of Americans in every racial category are annoyed by the woke crowd and they're insistence that nobody ever be offended\nSo Charles Blow pay which is that\nWe are allowed to racially polarized so long as we are targeting one political group\nThat not popular that's not popular\nEighty three percent of responding to make less than fifty grand just like political correctness Seventy percent of those who make more than a hundred grand are skeptical about it\nIf that means that the rich or you get the more you wipe political correctness so it's not poor people pushing political correctness is minorities pushing political correctness it is disproportionately rich white people pushing political correctness\nNow there is a political gap here among conservatives Ninety seven percent believe political correctness is a problem among traditional liberal sixty one percent do the only ones who really really really like\nThe won't culture are progressive accidents only thirty percent the political correctness and the problem they're far far outside of the mainstream so who's in this group according to the Atlantic I Love this\nCompared with the rest of the polling temple progressive accidents are much more likely to be rich highly educated and white\nThey're nearly twice as likely as the average make more than a hundred grand a year they're nearly three times as likely to have a post grad degree and well twelve percent of the overall sample in the study is African American only three percent of preventive active at star\nIt's rich white kids\nRich white kid those are the people who are creating a lot of the problems in our society right now with the talk of divisive polarization and political correctness\nIn one second I'm to explain what the spending means by political correctness that sort of important we have to define our terms we'll get to that in just one second but first let's talk about your online security with

mean by political correctness\nAccording to the land pick an extended interviews and focus groups participants made clear they were concerned about their day to day ability to express themselves they worry that a lack of familiarity with the topic or an sinking word choice could lead to Syria social sanctions for them\nSo they're not really sure what it means that they know that they don't like the feeling of restriction woke left his created\nBut there's plenty of support for the idea that Americans are not as neatly divided by age or race as is commonly believe according to peel only twenty six percent of black Americans consider themselves liberal\nNearly half of Latino to argue that many people nowadays are too sensitive Muslims are treated two and five black folks say that an immigration nowadays is bad for America\nIn other words this notion that demographics is destiny which has been pushed by both sides of the political out to a certain extent is just not true\nAnd there is no shrinking white majority that is going to inevitably leads liberal domination and there is no inevitably increasing liberal majority that is going to lead to incredible victory over time\nPeople's minds can be changed in other words we are individuals they are not just members of groups\nThat's really important to remember in the middle of what is a very very polarized news cycle and this is why the left\nHad some serious problems even going forward\nNow that doesn't mean that the right can't do things to alienate them the right obviously can do things to alienate folks and\nWould say there's a difference between being politically incorrect and being a jerk and this is where the right has to be careful\nNot everything that you say that it offensive is just you being politically incorrect sometimes you being a jerk if you use the N word that's not you being politically incorrect and if you being a jerk\nIf you say that men and women are different that is politically incorrect and you would not being a jerk when I Would recommend is that if you actually wants to side with that middle of America that its tire of the standards that are being prevented by the left\nThe polite be civil and be politically incorrect say things that are factual specifically because they're factual and not merely to offend believe me you don't have to purposely offend the Web the left will be offended anyway\nNone of it matters and what will always be offended I just spoke at USC last week and it was fascinating as a young black woman who got to ask a question and she said you've been accused of inciting violence and I said well you've been here the whole time have you heard anything that you think would incite violence and she thought about it for a second and she said no\nOf course not of course not\nThe reason that folks on the left suggested I incite violence is because they disagree with me\nThat is why well it turns out that most Americans\nWould rather have disagreement than imbued violence and somebody who's not involved in violent and when the left equate speech and violence and then tons of their own violence his speech\nAll they're doing is alienating the vast majority of the American people left is now playing against the Democratic party is playing a game speech of the right they say is violence because right when it was a bad\nAnd their own violence is speech so in the left goes in towns on the doors of the Supreme Court and acts threatening that just a form of speech and just the anger according to CNN but if folks on the right said stuff that offends people that's now form of violence\nOn CNN headline news when I say a man is a man and woman is a woman and some\nTransgender woman grits me by the back of the neck and Britain's me bottle bodily harm those two things are equivalent me take a man as a man or woman as a woman according to the left is the equivalent of somebody grabbing me physically on national television and threatening\nOne of somebody grabbing me physically on national television and threatening to send me home and in an ambulance which is literally what happened the left\nIs engaged in in this really polarizing him and most Americans don't fight and that's what we found out in the ... and ...\nMost Americans don't buy it and that doesn't mean that Trump going to win from here to attorney it doesn't mean the Republicans always when Republicans are not good at this game they're not and again when you mistake political incorrect for being a jerk or vice versa you are making a rather large mistake yourself\nBut it is important to note that this notion on the left at the ... majority is just all the black people and all the women and everybody else it's just not true statistically and that's a very very important thing to keep in mind we still have more in common than than not and you can be fooled by watching our politics are watching social media I Will too\nBut it's not reality I mean speaking of folks who are not living in reality there they leaked report from Google was leaked to Breitbart and it's just an amazing report\nTo abide by ... and internal company breathing produced by Google elites exclusively to Breitbart News argue that due to override your batteries including the election of President Trump the American tradition of free speech on the Internet is no longer viable\nThis goes to a declaration thing folks on the left have decided that if their speech they don't like into ... violent and does it must be shut down\nThe slightly video footage showing top executives declaring their intention to ensure that the rise of Trump populist movements just a blip in its history Google has repeatedly denied that the political bias of its employees filtered into its product but the eighty five page breathing titled the good censor the good I mean how Orwellian is that\nThey actually have a briefing at Google called the good censor admit that Google and other tech flap on now control the majority of online conversation and have undertaken a shift toward censorship in response to unwelcome political events around the world coming up\nWe'll continue with into Google memo that was linked to Breitbart News showing that they no longer care about free speech instead they're pursuing civility plus we'll talk about the Saudi
