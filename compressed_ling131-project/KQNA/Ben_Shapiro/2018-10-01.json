why the left wants us to act like a mob it's October and you know that means an important holiday is coming up\nOr it's no more shade day is coming up by October night not many people know about this we're trying to educate people about the fact the shape of our was a mass murder and you know a fascist than a killer and a coward and all kinds of wonderful things so I found this quote from shape of

leaders and they're angry grievances whatever it is they get the way they binder together and of course the reason is in part\nThat when you were in a mob your identity gets fused into the mob and this is what psychologists say that you're no longer yourself you're now this group your conscience gets to the news and you know longer blame yourself for the things that you're doing it's everybody everybody was doing and we were ... you know every everybody was new and so it wasn't new\nAnd you got it kind of takes the moral weight of your actions off your shoulder and that means you can be

need a mobbed over one thing for what they need is American traditions American Jurisprudence they need a mob over on our sense that man is innocent until proven guilty that we shouldn't the the person who was accused of something has a right\nTo find evidence against him not evidence that was happening that these things occur it doesn't matter if other people have been raped that doesn't mean the man being used as a rapist\nSo where ever there is an injustice whether it's real or imagined they want to organize us into a mob so if a cop shoots a guy in Chicago and the guy is black and the cop is why\nThey want to organize us into black and white is the blacks el my gosh cop to white cops are coming back out again and again and again and again studies even by leftist organizations

people that that is going on you can turn them into a mob\nAnd that is the way that you overcome the breaks that American society has built on on mom passions I mean this was a great fear of our founders the mom was a great hero founders\nThey wanted people to have power but they knew that people could be easily organized into a mob and so they were afraid of that and that's why they have all these systems for breaking power for putting some power over here and some power over there to oppose it and for everybody to be fighting with each other nobody get carried away\nAlright\nYou close

read\nAh everything that she wrote on Twitter because this is a family program that she did say white men or bowl\nOr she said oh man it's sick\nHow much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men about those are some of the more polite things that she said about men goes on and on and on\nThere was a there was an outcry from reasonable people I mean to say conservatives to say are you really going to let this woman on your board they said absolutely and then Twitter which has now censoring hate speech gave her a little check mark because she is now a\nA big important person you know and whenever you accused him of this whenever you actually hold this stuff up to them\nThey always say well it's not often that this is just this feminist here in Athens there but that to me is like a mobster saying we're not all hitting it only we only have one or two hit men but you know they control everybody you know they have these people and you know denounce them one of them are with them\nThat's right and you're saying it's not all feminists it's just the public ones those are the ones that I Would even say it's just their leaders but it's not even just their leaders leaders of

just ... formative miss Sandra but uh uh well it is certainly being performed but then you look at people like that Hawaii senator uh Mazie Hirono who says men need to shut up it's time for them to

these feminist men and women and these you know there there were sixteen hundred men who took out an ad in the New York times full page ad\nTo say that they believe all women and they are the good ones there you know they're not the bad guys and but it goes it's all over the place even the ones who say we're just kidding a Huffington Post at a piece on this\nUh what women mean when we say that men are trash is a quote it can actually be directly translated into masculinity is in transition and it's not and moving ... fast enough and this is what they're really talking about this is where academia is coming in this is where these\nA senator senator run was coming in is they're saying no no it's not it's not all of masculinity it's toxic masculinity\nOh really that raised ... so the CDC\nHas a study at a toxic masculinity\nAnd ah but what they what they define it as it comes from hedge demonic masculinity this is a gender theory which is that a ... has your Monica masculinity from orange W Connell formerly Robert Conley is a transgender guy who is now a a ... now a academic\nAnd he says that it's the oppressive characteristics of masculinity boys and men must assuming

getting it and they and then as a result of all this academia all of his activism\nWe're getting these bogus statistics the CDC is saying that in America one in five women is raped ... if that were they I mean a parent or they might be studying downtown ...\nOr ...\nOr Chicago or but according to the national crime victimization survey\nThat the actual number is an order of magnitude laugh at

were the b._b._c. ran this interview with a few mothers and the question was why his feminism affected the mother son bond a mother was interviewed she said she was furious\nBecause she gave her her little boy gender neutral toys you know dolls to play with or this or that but he gravitated toward that traditionally male toys guns and army men and that sort of thing and she's furious over this what is she to do\n... I mean than a million studies about this and kids do this without any training whatsoever no\nThat is the kids do this without any training whatsoever\nOf course they do and I got to tell you your your Prager video come out of the right time because last year feminism was the Merriam Webster\nWord of the year and a surprisingly so but I Can't imagine that this can go on forever there's got to be a turning point here because what they're doing is is they're creating this uh this sense of panic based on lies and and slander and they're in this case obviously destroying a good match reputation and Brett Kavanaugh\nHow long can that persist before people of good faith and reasonable people and a half a half of the global population those men say a week and we can no longer tolerate this this is a vicious this is wild this is based on lies\nYou know it's funny I had friends who have two boys and they wouldn't let them play with guns so the boys took a piece of wonder bread without the center and made it into a gun and shot each other that Michael ... Michael ... thanks so much for coming on a great job and I will be listening to your show later on going to say it or not\nYou know one of the things I've noticed about young men I work a round a lot of people who are much younger than I Am and I've noticed that when we talk about women as which is what men talk about him and talk a lot about when\nWe say in the same thing we notice that women have the same traits we can see them with our eyes and experience and then life\nBut the younger men are angry about younger angry about the traits with women and older men tend to talk about the price of women with great affection\nSo if you say that women for example women are more emotional than that that is true women are more emotional than most of us older guys kind of find that charming into like phones and it's kind of softens our lives to have a woman in our life shots in our lives a little bit because it reminds us with emotions do play a part in life and we should pay attention to the\nYounger guys feel somehow cheated by this and of course it only took me a while to figure out the reason is the younger guys had not been told nobody told them everybody told them men and women are the same any difference you've seen societal induced okay\nAnd so they're angry when they have been treated they've been lied to the same is true of women it used to be that women told their daughters watch out for men they have a very very powerful sex drive they lose their heads they do stupid stuff there sometimes cruel some of them are bad guys you have to really pay attention to this\nYou know and once you knew that you understood that when you were dealing with a good man when you were dealing with a man who didn't behave that way\nYou know we're dealing with somebody who had a lot of restraint somebody who had been trained to respect other people to understand that women were in fact other people will get all that and I think is very hard it's very hard for young men when they are awash\nIn testosterone to get that through their heads and it's very hard enough for them not to think like target you know there's a ... target female target female that's what that's everything in their body is tell him to do that\nSo girls were warned and they were told and then they learned that men most men most men are pretty good you know most men are pretty decent especially when they're sober most men are pretty things and they they learn to respect that as well and they learn to respect them as power and they learn to respect his restrain\nIf you lie about what people are it makes people angry when they discover the truth this is one of the biggest problems with the left is they want to why they want to tell us things aren't the way they are oh Islam it's the ruins a piece you know they want to tell us that and men get twice as angry\nAt me starting generalize twice was more than twice twice as much instead of saying\nOh you know some uh some forms of Islam are not so ...\nYou can get serious with everybody and listen to the state we find ourselves and they have wide towards the\nFeminist lied to us about what men or they lie to us about what women are and everybody has ticked off at one another and that's not the way it should be the ... the relationship between the sections she'll be one of the joys of life coming up Kanye West on Saturday Night live I'm Andrew", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "01"}
