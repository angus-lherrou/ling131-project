because of the Republicans and Democrats have decided that they are going to look as ugly and terrible as humanly possible in public as often as possible so funny because the Democrat after after losing that President Trump\nDecided that what they really needed to do was be more off putting\nIt look at President Trump and they see that his popularity ranger and love and I thought well you know what if we can imitate that but you it worse right so we won't have the the kind of blue collar appeal of President Trump we won't have any sort of personal charisma President Trump will just be insanely off putting and terrible all the time maybe that will win a power again\nAnd it doesn't seem like it is working the media are doing their best to try and cover for that so\nYou have this

of the quantity cake you innate\nWelcome back then Shapiro shouts out we now have a real gas lighting attempt in effect Democrats openly stating that my politics are okay and the media the thing that Democrats have said no such thing and there's no such thing as the Democratic not take for example dominance of Don Lemon last night\nHe had um a GOP commentator and Alex Stewart and she was talking about President Trump was ripping on the Democratic as an angry mob\nAnd your ... how it went down to London said it's so Alice Stewart said that calling felt a mob was actually accurate pointing people who are banging on the doors of the Supreme Court and people who've raft Senator Cruz and Heidi crude as well as yelling and Jeff Flake and Susan Collins in elevators and lemons that but that doesn't mean people don't get to object\nThat you're right it's Americans who objected covered in the first amendment it's like the first one\nAnd then Lewis again chimed in and argue the anti cabinet protesters engaged in my bag and which they did they went into the actual cabinet Senate hearing room and they screened until they were removed\nThey shouted until they were ... that's called my behavior okay it's a lemon says no that's not my behavior it's people who are upset and angry with the way the country is going\nThose two things are not mutually exclusive mobs typically are angry and upset with the way country and doing\nThe Reagan the media are trying to cover for all that is because the media are beginning to realize that shouting at Republicans not actually the best strategy for winning and so they're simply going to try to convince you at the person who is shouting in your ear is not real Harvey the bunny\nBunny just imaginary exist only on your imagination not a real things up media doing their best to try and tamped down the perception of the public that Trump is actually correct about all of it and the Republicans are right when they said Mitch McConnell of course is pushing for Mitch McConnell said listen this behavior and Hillary Clinton comment about\nCivility being out of Alan is on hinge stuff from the Democrats and then of course it's correct\nNo face until they get their way\nMore days on end tactics\nApparently this is the love rallying cry\nBut fortunately the American people know that the fact free politics\nFear and intimidation\nOr not how we actually govern\nAnd our democratic Republican\nWell this is right I mean the Democrats acting like ... children is not going to help them and that's why the media trying to convince you that not actually what's going on Rand Paul got himself\nIn a little bit of Twitter hot water yesterday or comments that he made a that are exactly correct he said that political assassinations could rise in the United states somebody could be held thanks to all of this violent rhetoric on the art of folks like Hillary Clinton now looking I'm somebody go back and listen\nTo condemn it sort of aggressive rhetoric from President Trump than twenty sixteen and point to the presidents of the United states when he was just a candidate\nWhen he was going to rallies and paying something like punch somebody you know pay your legal bills when he was doing that sort of stuff like that that's bad that's ugly he shouldn't be doing it all Democrats are the ones doing it today and it's just as bad\nIt's just a dad and there'd be more explicit about it too I mean when Hillary Clinton that civility is not required with anybody on the other side of the island's pretty damn explicit Rand Paul says this sort of stuff is going to get somebody killed I mean that Hillary Clinton is going to get somebody killed by the rise in temperature is likely to reach a boiling point at some point here\nRand says if he gets all sort of flat all sorts of lab for it\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed and ah that those who are ratcheting up to the the the conversation those who are actually getting their face they realized they bear some responsibility if there's over ...\nNow people are saying well what about Trump what about okay let's talk about ran for a second it's random one is making a comment Rand Paul had six of his ribs broken by a neighbor who allegedly didn't like his politics and literally just capital him on his property\nRequiring months and months of recovery Rand Paul also happened to be one of the people present at the congressional baseball game where a bunch of Congress people were shot at and these college for nearly murder\nSo I think that Rand actually does have a certain amount of credibility on this particular issue\nWhat literature in the country is going is a really ugly direction and it's got to be coming up if the solution to what ails on his gratitude maybe we ought to take a look at some of the statistics surrounding how good we have it\nHere in the United ... I Know you've heard a lot of that now how American in ... and how things really haven't gotten better than I think I mean I I actually want to make your life better than it was and I mean I'm really\nAll the products are getting better and you're getting them for cheaper\nHere's what they did they divided in Nineteen Seventy nine nominal prices I Nineteen Seventy nine average nominal hourly wages and two thousand Fifteen nominal price just by two thousand Fifteen average nominal hourly wages and they calculated the time costs of household items in each year that's a number of hours it would take to by Washington\nHousehold items in each year that's a number of hours it would take to buy a washing machine for example so for example\nThe time costs may thirteenth cubic foot refrigerator fell by fifty two percent in terms of the hours of work required at the average hourly nominate away so he could buy a refrigerator so the price of one and that makes you Richard regardless of what your top line income is\nNeedless to say the above price reductions greatly underestimate the totality of wealth or again by the average American ignoring qualitative et cetera and environmental improvement I'm commonly use item again those products are better today than they were yesterday\nSo it's pretty clear it is pretty clear that when it comes to products that we can buy we are much better off than they were and then I have any so where are we short or shorten education health care and housing because the cost of those things has written at a faster pace than total compensation however it is true that today's houses are larger\nAnd healthcare is better and education is more high tech\nAnd it's also true that the reason that house that houses have Britain and prices because of tremendous regulation on the part of democratic administrations for the most part in major cities the Reagan easy housing shortages in Los Angeles which is the most sprawling said you know in in the country and it's where I live\nIs because of heavy regulation and zoning\nSo what is the standard of living\nWell it's certainly\n... it certainly better than it was in Nineteen Seventy nine for the vast majority of people in the American public the average apartment is bigger the average stuff you have in her apartment is bigger the average house is better the average stuff that you have in that house is better\nShould suggest that maybe we should be kind of grateful for the country in which we live and stop trying to tear it down and stop trying to tear each other apart in the name of some utopian vision\nDemocrats might be wise to start there especially because the more and rage Democrats yet Republicans lag behind 'cause we we are not fond of the rage but if you in rage us\nWhen you awake that sleeping giant it's not good for you ... it is not good for you\nOkay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats' failure to recognize that basic truth and what they're saying now about\nJustice Kavanaugh but first let's talk about your sleep quality I don't think that while on the road you know why because I don't have my helix sleep mattress with me there was nobody on the planet like you so why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else he would sleep they'll to sleep when they take two minutes to complete\nThey use the answers match your body type and sleep preference as to the perfect mattress whether you're aside sleeper or a hot sleep or whether you like a pleasure from bad but he like there is no more guessing no more confusion just got a huge sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes liquid and they will match you to a mattress that will give you the best leap of your life\nFor a couple of healing can even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals important needs and your preferences for each side and a ten year warranty and get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free\nRight now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all now France orders to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he looks weak dot com slash Shapiro that you like sleep dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress order again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro my wife and I had a he looks we ... we took that sleep quickly ordered the mattress that came in the mail it's just fantastic so good\nWe got one for my sister for her wedding go check it out right now he likes fleet dot com slash Shapiro\nOkay so let's talk about the fact that the wife doesn't seem to realize they live in a a great country and that they believe that we all ought to be living in fear every single day now fear mongering is never a wonderful thing if you're going to get exercised about problems in your life you probably should be exercised about problems that\nAre cruelly prevalent know things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting that every woman in the country is at risk of rape every second of every day is probably not a good way to bring people together it's also not a good way to view your neighbors because the truth is that\nWomen are not at risk of sexual assault every day in the United states of America as a pretty safe country for women in fact it's the phrase the safest country for women in the history of mankind so there's that but\nThere's a song that now become very popular on Twitter and Facebook I'm not sure what her name is Mercedes when I got\nA and she's put up this song and folks on the left are just ecstatic about this on because it suggests that men should not be concerned about false allegations of sexual assault we should not be concerned about it anymore so\nYoung men who are worried that in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense that anybody can be accused at any time without any corroborating evidence they should sit down and shop because women have a tough now there's a logical flaw at the root of that which is two things can neutral on\nWomen can be afraid of bad men and men can be afraid of bad women why did you see things are supposedly mutually exclusive is beyond me I Do not understand why\nSaying that women have a right to be afraid when a man of cost them and treat them terribly why is that mutually exclusive with a man has a right to be afraid that a woman will make a false allegation against him I'm not saying that the fears ought to be equivalent in nature I'm not saying that the level of of\nThe or should be equivalent or that the level of prevalent to these events is equivalent to say that\nI shouldn't be afraid of something bad happening to me because something bad could happen to you makes no sense at all just on a logical level\nAnd the reason I say this is because there are cases many cases across the United states particularly on campus right now\nWhere men are being accused of things that they did not do and it's costing them time money and credibility so here's the story of James I'm Sorry James then when you get into this lady's song so James\nWas a freshman at the University of California Davis this is according to reason maddening who's on his way to math class when he received an email that we rarely life for the next few months university title nine office which handled sexual misconduct disputes between students was investigating a complaint against him this was in February twenty Eighteen\nRight after Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and all the rest James that this was not a good time to get accused of something like that the email from the title nine compliance officer when into great detail about the seriousness of James situation it would be investigated in accordance with university sexual assault and sexual violence policies\nAs well as the student code which covers physical assault Brett to violence and conduct that threatens health and safety\nOf finding of responsibility could result in suspension or even expulsion email the short on details will be a legit conduct according to the title nine off as a female student and Becky had complained that they James touched her on the bread and butter over and under her clothing without her consent\nJames who Becky they've been classmates and drama and briefly friends even about Tobar twenty two thousand Seventeen they'd met up with some other friends to play music eventually finding themselves alone and Becky storm\nIt gets for a few minutes engaged in some like sexual touching before other students interrupted them and James is view encounter had not only been fully consensual it was also mutual that people are just as much responsibility for initiating it as James as back you would later made clear to the investigator should also touched him sexually she it was described her own actions in her official statement\nJames attorney wrote about the incident and uh and here's what they wrote that these accounts of the incident and set forth in the summary of her investigative interviews does not on his face allege any actor prohibited conduct of matter investigation continued until may first\nAt which time the officers student and judiciary affairs finally concluded that James was innocent even to back it was a afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision and did that with the university policy is dictated\nBy the Obama administration's education department\nAnd costs James twelve thousand dollars in legal fees to defend himself against an allegation in which the girl admitted admitted that she was mutually involved in the sexual conduct\nI mean it's pretty astonishing according to back east complain\nKissing followed a night of mutual floating and started out romantic eventually she either ask him to close the door closed it herself that continue testing and also touching it they grind it against each other\nAnd he said he says my hand started making my way of preventing slowly respectfully testing the waters seemed to open his I make sure that he was enjoying what was happening she seemed into it and so he touched her over her clothes\nWhat was happening she seemed into it and so he touched her over her clothes and remove T shirt and she told them to drop it on the floor so in other words she was involved in every step of all of that\nRight at one point James became too forceful he was running against Russia's pressed against the closet door in fact he asked him to be more gentle yeah agreed and tell him down the writing back you'd miss that you catch the changes that I didn't think she gave ... she did however asking whether he was into certain types of sexual activity\nAnd she said that humans aroused by all of that so she said all of this to the title nine court costs and twelve thousand dollars anyway so should be worried about the sort of thing\nWhy not why wouldn't they wouldn't you'll be worried about the sort of stuff but according to feminine because women have a completely separate\nSet of years some of which are justified and some of which are overstated\nMen should not be worried about anything right cabinet guilty because bad things happen to women and basically the logic of black and then they wonder why folks on the center and on the right or not interested in that particular point of view\nWell here is that this song from Mercedes ones expressing that's been our point of view that that that women are threatened bad things happen to them therefore metric shut up here she is singing about five million use on Twitter it's gone viral of course\nI Can't even when they didn't know nine candles in a room\nAnd I can go to a room and I live in the new\nHousing for one second so she can do all those things all the things you got that you can't do she can do I agree that men can be paid and the women are at greater risk of being targeted by men and met her\nBut what does that have to do with the price of tea in China\nIt really has nothing to do with the main topic at issue\nBut according let something bad happened to me or it could happen to me therefore you should shut up about the possibility of something bad happening to yet which is just a line of logic I Do not understand coming up the less rage has not stopped over Brett Kavanaugh new op ed at the New York times as much a\nWoman asked what do I tell my daughter was like my daughter about Brett Kavanaugh I have an answer and what do you have a daughter and all that you mention here I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day":
