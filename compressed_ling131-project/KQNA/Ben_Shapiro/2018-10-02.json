Walsh show and even the Michael Moore show a deli wire dot com to listen to that when Trump just played that about the alcohol thing they're trying to shift at the alcohol\nAnd he says you want to talk about drinking you want to talk about drinking let's talk about the Senate and drinking in the Senate I mean the stories about the drinking in the Senate or in credible\nAnd you know he's pulling the rug out from under them because in the whole thing the whole thing was not about drinking it wasn't about temperament it was about ...\nTry to read a girl when he was Seventeen years old that was what it's about this all that they're just trying to move the goalposts that's what it's about and he's just call the amount of money and he just\nAnd I like my favorite remark in this whole press conference when he starts talking about ... about drinking and the fact that he doesn't drink and this is a ... number eleven\nI'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nRight so one of my only good traits I don't [laughter]\nWhenever they're looking for something good as I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I've just you know for whatever reason [noise]\nCan you imagine if I had what a mess I Would I be what'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched him and saying that he did have difficulty as a young man\nWith strength the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him\nHow confident they have I mean and actually Trump this is the thing Trump is talking since they're talking about whether he drank and college\nThey're talking about whether he drank in high school how about the last Twenty years oh what's his wife when like I mean how confident they have to be as president to say the fact that I don't drink is my only good trade and can you imagine what a monster I Would be if you you know just how he just is feeling like in his billing issues\n... I'm Sorry what people don't notice this because a lot of people don't like Trump and they don't notice the way he changes and we adapt see I've always said he's a very adaptable guy in the guy who worms on the job he said he would learn on the job and he has but that\nBut that is incredibly this is like the new presses an absolute hysteria about the left\nAbsolute hysteria about yes Lincoln ... in an elevator he collapses\nTrump is like a ... I mean I I'm Serious this is not normal Trump I mean Trump is always a fighter he's always in their fighting I'm not saying that but he's not always as confident\nAnd cool about the whole thing he does not seem like he has anything at risk and when they ask them for more time you know they're trying to delay this thing all they want they have to be I think it was nonsense that whole reason when Trump was right when he said it's a blessing in disguise because it's called them out that's why they have to change their tune but when they ask for more time he has this great responses ...\nTell me about time Dianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier\nIf she wanted a really thorough investigation when all the time in the world\nShe didn't have to wait until after the hearing was slowest essentially\nShe said listen\nI have a problem I have this report I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing in areas we had too much no she didn't do that she waited until we were closed\nAnd then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say but you probably did based on a very bad body\nBut you probably did based on a very bad body language other day but\nMore importantly under sense for her to wait at that period of time and now for you Democrats\nAnd I guess I'm mentally new to the media but I consider you a part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats to be\nTalking about we want more time for the FBI if he wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein bring this up\nThat that is amazing it's just amazing stuff because you could see the reporters asking the question I don't know who was was a way to a reporter asking the question when he said I just include you with the Democrats she looked like she kind of when it's going to Republican struck are almost\nThe government isn't complete control this press covers partly I'm sure it's because of a victory NAFTA which really does working in a lot of what a lot of the ... answers a lot of the attacks on him\nBut partly it's got to be because he feels he has got this thing ...\nAnd I listen to part of why I think this Kavanaugh thing is collapsing they are not going to show even people on the left\nWho are undecided they're not going to sell you that we said the the rape somebody was not rape when he was drinking what they are there some guy but he didn't stand near the punch bowl\nWas that you know he was standing with any of them get into Heathrow some ice and the guy in college\nNot going to wash I just don't think so and I think that you know I I take this from the fact that the left is moving the goalposts left without changing the subject basically because it once was FBI thing started it was kind of like a yeah I think we got nothing\nSo they're changing it temperament and didn't drink in college and didn't throw things allies and all this stuff\nAnd the fact that Trump has just remain at ...
