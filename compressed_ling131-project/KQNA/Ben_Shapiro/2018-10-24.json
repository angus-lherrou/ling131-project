Obama had made a speech and condemning police officers in probably ... I didn't pay that that was Iraq Obama's fault that wasn't ... thought there was an act and evil on the part of a person who was\nActually evil or mentally ill or both\nAnd that had nothing to do with rock Obama's words I think you can raise the temperature in society and do serious damage to the society because you've written the temperature of that site\nBut I'm not going to get from the individual acts of violence and evil to individual political viewpoints unless those viewpoints are actively calling for violence and to do anything less lean to the sort of censorship that make the country at worst place in that way\nAnd he believed that free speech is inherently connected to violence you're more likely to crack down on free speech in order to prevent that violence and that seems to be more of a broad danger than individuals in the United states do evil thing\nWith that said obviously that's a really really bad stuff and it goes to the question of motive\nBecause what we're seeing now why why is this breaking out so much\nBecause what we're seeing now why is this breaking up so much why are we seeing rice and sent to Susan Collins in Maine why are we seeing rock and ruins the throne through windows and Kevin McCarthy these offices in California\n\nFolk life insurance is really important but one third of people don't have it\nBecause it's kinda hard to buy in because you've been waiting around too long you have to work out what you need\nThen do the research to find the best quote you have to hope you don't get swindled it's not a good way to shop or anything and that's why policy genius has made the whole process a lot of look like and you need life insurance you want to take care of your family policy genius compares quotes from the top like insurance companies to find the best policy for you it takes you two minutes to get a quote and he don't know the first thing about insurance and got all the tools to get up to speed\nLearning the difference between common whole life insurance calculate how much coverage and he'd be sure you're making the right decision in back over four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance housing genius doesn't just make life insurance he definitely disability insurance and home insurance in auto insurance any care about it then covered whether you know a lot about like insurance or nothing at all\nStart your stark a policy junior dot com and just to me that you can compare closed and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones policy genius and indeed the easy way to compare and buy like insurance go check them out right now a policy junior dot com\nThere's a reason millions of people who needed them policy genius\nThe easy way to compare and buy like insurance\nSo this was an amazing story we've got Stephen and Malik are Gregory in ...

shows up\nThe Democrats are fully invested in seeing everything President Trump that in the worst possible like his comments on nationalism are no exception\nMazie Hirono center from Hawaii when President Trump said that he's a national she says maybe it's because he's a white supremacist or an anti Semite\nWe should stop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand what he means any refers to nationalist or\nAny of these other terms that these are not just dog with a bullhorn it's racism is basically for many people as a um anti Semitic as white supremacy he knows very well what he's talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay maybe my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism on the president said nationalism I'm not hearing Nazi he's saying that he prioritize the United states is more security\nOver the human rights of people trying to make their way across the board you may disagree with that and there's no way that that has anything to do with racism or anti Semitism but this became the actual talking point across luck yesterday\nJemma costs on CNN and waiting to find you somebody who loves you like Jim Acosta loves him some ... here is Jim Acosta thing well maybe when President Trump's national he means white nationalist\nOkay or maybe when Democrats and sets up I just think that he's an idiot here as Democrats\nWhen you're demonizing middle Easterners and making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on and Medicare rent without offering any proof and then call yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journal is making so much objective journalism in there from Jim Acosta only if anyone or that people asked whether the president has announcing when he when he said things like we should protect our border and nationalism\nMean flashback to block Obama two thousand five thing exactly the same thing the ... actually said right here's Obama circuit two thousand five when he was just a senator barely a glimpse in the nation's I there he was saying exactly the same thing that Donald Trump\nOr a generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who enter the country illegally and those who work for them just respect the rule of law and they are\nShowing disregard for those who are following the law we simply cannot allow people to pour in for the United states\nUndetected undocumented unchecked circumventing the line of duty for waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the become immigrants in this country\nOkay so uh you know again that I get the bronco by the way back when was that sort of white nationalist also you know being half white\nI get that he was a white nationalist as well it wasn't just in my ... who at this point basically everything that he says she'll be profits year diary because he says all the quiet itself out loud it was almost anything to get around that are more objective journalists being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean under tones that are not just racial they're just being a phobic ... says something to the present some sort of shied away from in the ass obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow with it I'm somebody who said that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think the nationalism alone is enough I think there are ties that bind that it has of history and culture but what actually make the United states the United states is the root idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution and backed by two thousand years of Judeo Christian History or rather three thousand years in jail Christian History\nAnd that's what makes the United states the United states and the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states' unique data unique idea in world history so I'm not such a big fan even of the president using nationalistic language but just ingested as white supremacy is just ...\nBut again this comes back to the basic idea you want to raise the temperature in the country you want to raise the the\nThe hackles of people on the other side\nAll you have to do is just question motives day in and day out and that's what we are now in the business and doing the truth is that in a country where we agree on Ninety percent of our values we really do I think in the end a grand Ninety percent of our valley the only way you can divide up by\nCastigated people disagree with you on a manifestation of those values as evil nasty bigoted horrible people\nComing up making tally of NBC News got herself in some really hot water everybody does this time of year because we're approaching Halloween and started talking about Halloween costumes that means cultural insensitivity and taking steps right on a landmine we'll talk about what she said that was right when she said that was wrong Ventura\nNowhere was making Kelly suggesting that black people should be ... you know what I was making Kelly suggesting that black people are in Iraq in any way in fact are making Kelly what's interesting is that maybe why people want to dress up at some famous black people because they admire those famous black people that is not the same thing and people dressing up in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a ...\nI think in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a frat party dressed as a black person with black makeup on\nMy desk insensitive and you should take into account black people's feelings about historic use of this sort of ... or a mockery\nI also think there's a difference between even if ... going to a party and a little girl who decides that she wants to dress up as Michelle Obama and so she puts on dark make up\nBecause I think that you can pretty easily tell the difference to notice the attempt to miss it from the motives in our society is really gross Megan Kelly is not a racist and making it was not attempting to be racist by that statement at best and worst at worst Megan Kelly was being ignorant of the history of blackface and the impact and still has on black folks in the United states\nThat the worst hit but there is no way to Megan Kelly was actually suggesting it's okay to mock black people\nThat is not what was happening here and yet here in CNN feminine suggesting that Megan Kelly actually is a racist because there's never been a time when black face with acceptable first of all he doesn't know where she ... she doesn't know what kind of party she went to like download and doesn't know that\nSo it isn't just the Megan Kelly would a racist when she was seven years old because you dress up as Diana Ross and black interface for it\nI Would suggest that Don Lemon doesn't\nReally know what he's talking about you may know what he's talking about historically with regard to black said but again there's a difference between darkening your face for a costume to\nRaise an African American person and darkening your face you mock African American people and I said several times in the segment I still don't think that you should do it to praise African American people specifically because they're too many black folks\nAre going to look at that and say well maybe your mocking you maybe the real reason you're doing that because you're mocking beside of sensitivity you shouldn't do that\nThe attempt to immediately attribute the worst available motive to Megan Kelly is really telling and it said something about the nastiness of our politics right now\n... forty seven years old she's already has there has never been any time in her forty seven years that blackface has been acceptable [noise] um there were always people on that panel\nThere were no African Americans know people of color there to say hey Megan\nHey so this is this is\nReally really absurd you know again\nThe the taking black pitcher Italy is fine but Mitch attributing motives who's not getting example you want to you know you wonder how we should deal with these issues really how we deal with these issues\nThe same way the Jamie Fox deals with these issues so Jamie Fox was you know it is obviously an incredibly prominent black man in the United states made lots of money as a musician as an actor very talented guy\nHe is very close friends with Robert Downey junior a few years ago he did it by Catholic Joe Rogan and in the middle of the podcast the question of Robert Downey junior actually putting on black face for the movie Tropic Thunder came up Robert Downey junior was nominated for best supporting actor Oscar and there was no way by the way that even\nYeah I think what one was Tropic Thunder made maybe ten years ago eight years ago maybe eight years ago in any case there is no way that movie gets made even today because of the great sensitivity around identity politics but here is Jamie Fox is perfectly decent\nExplanation of Robert Downey junior and how he feels about all of this\nPeople have to understand where it comes from there are real people do that it really mean you ...\nLike outside of us I mean there's some real people who really don't like whatever you are whether you're black you why you're you're straight you're gay whatever it is there's some people who really doing\nWe're in agreement and it's easy were easy targets\nOkay so when when Jamie Foxx and jets you have to know where it's coming from there is some people who are bad out there who don't like it but Robert Downey junior is not one of those people\nWhy don't we start thinking of each other as people who probably could be friends if we would stop shooting each other like garbage\nAnd Megan Kelly is not going to a party dressed in blackface my black people and it's kind of amazing how certain people get away with that sort of stuff because everybody assumes about motives on their part so for example\nTom Hanks in two thousand four was at a fundraiser and that that fundraiser there was a comedian who got up and it was one fray and he was actually making jokes while wearing black face right he's actually dark and his face and he was wearing a right way and Tom Hanks was cool with that\nKind of controversy lasted about five minutes because Tom Hanks looking that never should have happened it was inappropriate I don't know what's going on there I understand people were offended and everybody said right Tom Hanks dozens of race as we know he didn't mean to mock black people we know that he's not interested in taking in somehow hurting black people and everybody got on with their lives\nBecause we are interested in right now and what can we can people to the wall over that makes for the worst available country the worst version of ourselves\nAnd that has to stop whether we are talking about making Kelly or whether we're talking about President Trump or whether we are talking about the the attempt to nail people on the other side of the aisle\nI'm going to talk a little bit more about this plus I Want to talk about the latest on the care of an issue in just a second and plus there's been breaking news on the return address of the suspicious packages\nBut first let's talk about the fact that you are going to die I Know ... today but the fact is that if you haven't thought about that you're probably also haven't thought about getting life insurance and you ought to have life insurance just as a responsible human being now maybe you thought about life insurance but it's kinda hard to buy because you have to work out what you need to do the research to find the best quote\nHope we don't get swindled well that's why you need policy genius policy genius compares quotes from the top like insurance companies\nAnd they find the best policy for you it takes just two minutes to get a quote if you don't know anything about insurance and got all the tools to get you up to speed or the difference between term in whole life insurance calculate how much coverage you need you sure you're making the right decision and back over four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance\nI'll teaching it doesn't just do life insurance either they also do disability insurance home insurance auto insurance\nIf you care about it they got insurance for it so whether you know a lot about life insurance or nothing at all start your search a policy ingenious dot com in two minutes you can compare quotes make an informed decision for you Andrew mumbling policy genius indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance policy genius dot com go check it out right now let them know we thought you okay so\nThe the update with regard to these bombs that there was a return address that was put on the labels Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office that doesn't mean that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is actually sending these bombed it means that somebody is probably trolling by doing exactly that okay so\nI Want to talk a little bit about a little bit more about you know where we are at the society and how we how we care all of it\nAgain we need to start with the premise that the people that we are talking about generally do not have\nHarm in mind that their goal is not to destroy us in any way if we figure that then we can have normal elections yes fraught heated election but we're not going to be trying to kill each other because we can assume that\nMost people in the United states grew up in the same dealt with the same devices and we did\nAnd they did I mean the reality is that we all grew up in the same million\nOur values are not all that different\nEven though as right wing members of the United states and looked lots of members of the United states theoretically agree on certain basic values like freedom of speech and treating each other compassionate land decently\nAnd why things we all grew up in the same study when you grow up in the same side you share a certain level of baseline valley now I think that splitting I think that's one of the problems the country but one of the ways that split it exacerbated by simply assuming the political disagreement reflects underlying character differences in now speaking of political disagreements\nYou know the polarization of our politics\nThat social fabric common values I say are being split and you're seeing it in in some of these democratic campaign\nOne of those campaigns from Stacey Adams is the Georgia gubernatorial candidate for the Democrats and she was caught on tape talking about free market here's what she had to say\nAnd [laughter] [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nSo you're on the radio [laughter]\nGame and you can't hear you saying the free market I had never solves any problems in medical you'll which is obviously on ... you know based on route issues in American politics I think states Abrams is therefore lacking and now I don't think she's just wrong I think he's wrong and she doesn't know enough about economic and she's not interpreting the economic that she does now\nBut you should that person I don't know if they think I'm\nProbably not even though they you know there's tape of her I I Believe now burning a flag back in college so I guess we have now ripping directly from script written by Aaron Sorkin like we're actually just going to do the American president all over again\nWith ... I I notice this weird trend in the news in the last couple of days like there was there and they looked Boston plane that landed on the one oh one nor I got like not that far from where we do on that\nAnd all I can say thank God for the ...\nBecause the royal Airforce really take care of business making sure the ... and so the man and a high capitalist coming through bath exciting and apparently state the Abrams is directly from the American president\nAnd then there was a story that I thought that it I could look exactly like David trimmer\nRobbing a liquor store and and robbing a beer so raw from a friend has been cut loose and President Trump the president Donald Trump the president and the United states\nYou know Scott Scott Adams the guy ... living in a simulator I'm starting to maybe believe that we're just living inside we're we're we're script but in any case\nAnd the ... the innovation that that\nAre growing in the country does need to be rectified but they cannot be rectified in any serious way unless we start cutting worst available loaded hey everybody and that holds true even with regard to some of these companies like worshiper Beto O'Rourke which is foolish but I don't think it's coming from the place and people were bad I think it's just coming from a place and people who\nFall in love with politicians in dumb as possible way okay now speaking\nOf bad motives need Democrats keep attributing to President Trump all sorts of racism with regard to this migrant ... latest on the migrants ...
