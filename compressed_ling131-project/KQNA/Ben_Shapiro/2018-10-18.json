naturally that means that we're not going to a free market capitalism and entrepreneurial is more going to dump all over them\nAnd there are a bunch of stories today along these lines\n... the top one

is the creation of new products and services that create new jobs and it also allow people to buy cooler style\nSocialism is about freezing the economy in place and redistributing all the pilots in the room\n... capitalism is that expanding the size of the pie\nNow that doesn't mean that everybody is going to get an equal distribution of the pie but it does mean that you're going to be able to generate new and better types of pie bigger by everything that makes pie awesome\nOtherwise you can just freeze it and distribute it until there is no pilot that's basically the socialist model so

this stuff is going to get paid for\nSo why why it has is they're all this and the jazz them for this sort of stuff in a time when we have asthma yesterday seven million unfilled jobs in the United states a four percent unemployment rate and historically booming economy why are we talking about undermining the pillars\nOf capitalism because we have shifted our mind that in the United states\nAnd this is really what I Want to talk about today we have shifted our mindset when it comes to\nWhat our lives should be like\nWe believe we are guaranteed things here in the United states we believe that we are guaranteed a solid level of living because we live here you hear this from Bernie Sanders all the time in the richest country in the world wouldn't we really have people who don't have enough money to buy all the things that they could possibly want\nTo hear that from Bernie Sanders all the time the assumption there being you were born here you deserve stuff you were born here therefore America's rich therefore you get stuff\n... a baseline assumption you're entitled to thing\nHere is what you are entitled to in a free country you are entitled to adventure\nThat's what you're entitled to your born entitled to exercise your rights in pursuit of adventure you get to make up your own story here that the American dream the American dream is people who are coming from across the the place they did not know to an environment that we're not used to\nAnd building lives for their families and creating prosperity from the ground up\nThe American story is people crop in the Appalachians into wilderness they did not know places that had not been\nGoing to areas where they had no allies setting down roots and trying to build towns in civilization\nThat the American story the American story is poor folks who have an idea and go find funding for that idea and then build that idea in some of the great companies in American history\nThat the American for the American dream was never year here therefore we give you think that was never the American idea coming up the big problem\nWith this new vision of America as a place where you sort of just get thing is that it takes away to the American ideal to the African American personality that have been a central element of America is the greatest country on planet earth we'll talk about that in just a second aventura\nAnd then we say okay well what can we do to provide that when what can we do to get all the obstacles out of your way what can we do to remove the barriers\nThat the American way is not the American way it wasn't you know ... ... total comfortable to stretch a wing it may be difficult to leave home it may be harder to do that\nIt shows that we're just going to make sure you know you never have to\nBuy ... we're going to Cato you we're going to make sure the or swam in the warm blanket of government benefits\nWe're going to ensure that you never have to get out there and fly again this is not coming from place to no sympathy this is coming from a place of you can't innovate your children you can't innovate your communities and you can't intervene your country on the basis of empathy alone and that is the best case interpretation of what exactly Democrats are doing here the worst case interpretation\nIs something much more cynical the purpose for innovation of an entire sector of the population specifically to gain votes and thereby political power\nAnd after you look at towns like Detroit it's hard to imagine that's not what's been going on there for decades because the failure of this sort of of thinking is evidence in major cities and counties across the United states\nIf you actually want to\nReinvigorate the American spirit\nWe're going to have to teach people that same lesson the gods taught Abraham at the very beginning of the Bible\nLeaves a home that you were born in and go to a place you do not know\nThat's how we become bigger that's how we become better that's how wide become better that's how the world becomes better trained becomes better as well you have cool stuff\nIs white cultured become better because they experience and bounce off of other cultures\nThat this notion that we can hunger now now because we've reached paradise and all we have to do it hunker down and live and and redistribute what in our backpacks those backpacks are gonna run out ... any of this war okay Joe in just a second I Want to talk about this fascinating article in the New York times about why scientists\nAre are now attempting to avoid actual research out of fear of the all right but first let's talk about how you go out at night you come home from work you need to get ready to go to a party you need to get ready to go out to dinner

dollar shave ... dot com slash than\nA dollar shave club dot com slash then and there was a fascinating article in the New York times I Want to talk about\nBecause it speaks to the lack of objectivity when it comes to the intersection with politics\nThe article from New York Times is titled why white supremacist are chugging milk\nAnd why geneticists are alarmed and here's what they say it was from Amy Harmon nowhere on the agenda of the annual meeting of the American society of human genetics being held in San Diego this week and the ... many of its members there are occurring appropriation of the field research in the name of white supremacy sticking your neck out on political issues is difficult\nTo Jennifer Wagner a bioethicist and president of the group's social issues committee\nWho sought to convene a panel on the racist and its use of genetic and found little fraction of the specter of the field and to many us past which includes support for the American eugenics movement looms large for many geneticists in light of today's white identity politics they also worry about how new tools that are allowing them to hone in on the genetic basis\nOf hot button traced like intelligence will be misconstrued that racist ideology is an argument that I have a pretty frequent basis with a friend of mine Jane costs in over a box or Jane is black and\n... and I think rightly has great sensitivity and everybody should have great sensitivity but I think Jane would suggest that her background contributes to the sense to me I'm with regard to\nThe race has passed of the United states and the and the racist association\nBetween politics and bad science and so this has led she's in Syria conversations between the two of us\nAbout political correctness about whether in fact there was an appropriate time to talk\nAbout IQ for example or standardized testing for example or about that natural differences between men and women like when you talk about biology without being condemned and sexist or racist these are real issues that we happen to Scott and take on head on unfortunately the scientific community has decided to quash\nA lot of actual science because they're afraid that people who are racist or going to take that science out of context and then use that to go out into submission minority group and that's basically what this New York times article about his in recent months some scientists have spotted distortions of their own academic papers and far right Internet forums others have fielded confused queries about claims of white superiority\nWrapped in the jargon of human genetics misconceptions about how gene factor into America stark racial disparities\nHas surfaced in the nation's increasingly heated arguments over school achievement gap immigration and policing instead of long discounted proxies like school circumference and family pedigrees according to experts to track the far right today's proponents of racial hierarchy are making their case by and misinterpreting research on the human genome itself\nAnd debate that have been largely limited to ivory tower forums the scientist whose job is to mine human the humanities genetic variations\nFor the collective good are grappling with how to respond if there's a real way to respond all of this put out the science and then defend the science that's the way to respond all of us instead the scientists afraid that there are scientists are going to be misappropriated misinterpreted or use for bad reasons\nThey've decided that they are going to simply squash all the discussion internally\nJohn November as University of Chicago evolutionary biologists he'd been studying human genetic diversity is easier in a society where diversity is clearly valued and celebrated\nRight now that is very much on my mind once my doctor November his folded into his recent talks to pitch a group of white nationalist chugging milk at a two thousand Seventeen gathering to draw attention to a genetic trait known to be more common and white people than others the ability to digest lactose as adults\nAnd also shows a social media posts are going to count as called entered the milk zone with a map lifted from a scientific journal article on the trades evolutionary history and most of the world the article explains the gene that allows for the digestion of lack of switches off after childhood\nBut with the arrival of the first cattle herders and Europe some five thousand years ago a chance mutation that lasted turned on provided enough of nutritional led up to nearly all those who survived eventually carried it\nAnd then the post shows a snippet of hate speech urging individuals that African ancestry leave America saying if you can bring milk you have to go back well\nI mean do what they're idiots in one of the great ironies of of white supremacist the stupidest people on the planet\nThey're constantly talking about white people are superior and they're just dumb ass it\nAs one of the things that's so funny it's like if you're going to proclaim white superiority and you really shouldn't send your ... as I'm In a commentary that accompany the paper in the journal genetics documentary warned that research is wrapped in numerous cabinets that are likely get lost in translation because\nPeople are flaunting DNA ancestry test indicating exclusively European heritage but\nThe problem here is that we actually have to look at what science does have to say because it is a con founding factor when you look at attributing racism to America so take for example racial disparities in education\nSo there's a lot of talk these days about affirmative action and whether people are performing at certain levels eligible to get them into college\nAnd nice ingestion is that it is historic American racism that has led to that has led to the education gap in America's higher education system\nIn alternative would be that the test scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups\nTest scores do not wind up equally among various ethnic groups and that is true not just that there are two black and white it's not for reproductive white and Asian why people score\nLower on the SAT that Asian people do as a general matter in the United states how much of that of genetic how much of that happens to be environmental we don't actually know the answer to that that the hotly broad question\nIn science but suggesting that racism is to blame for everything without looking at other confounding factors like for example test scores is a mistake and leads us to the wrong outcome and we just to the wrong measures due to deal with those outcomes\nGenetics is not the answer to all of these disparities but neither is racism\nNow these are questions we have to be very careful that because obviously you don't want to give material to people who are suggesting that people some people are narrow inherently\nAre inherently worse or more evil or more violence or stupid or because of the color of their skin genetics doesn't line up that way but\nYou also have to look at questions of science because your eye scientists\nDo and it is and it's fascinating to watch this debate play out in real time\nSo there there are doctors who have organized meetings and social scientist and it's a social implications of the field newest tools David ... Baylor College of medical geneticist who's president of the human genetic society says it will not pay completely quiet on the issue is that there is no genetic evidence to support any racist ideology\nWhich is true because of racism is a moral view and genetics is they typically you and scientific racism is the use of science in order to be racist and it's not the use of science in order to pursue good and\nSo it it here silencing research because you're afraid of how people are going to use that research and I would suggest that are misusing science we need to have some very hard conversation about actual science actual problems the natural solution without falling prey to the idea that because that people are going to make you the information we have to wash the information it's OK\nComing up a bevy of actresses now say that is neat princesses are very very bad we need to Disney Princess reject other Disney Princess it as I get the Russians we're now moving why because Disney", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "18"}
