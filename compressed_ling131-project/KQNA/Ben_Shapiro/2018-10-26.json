[noise]\nWe're treats you\nCome back to the venture bureau and we've been told by the media all volatility in the country is due to President Trump ally an interim have contributed to the volatility in the country it pre existed him it will continue after is gone and the media provide\nSo let's say for example Katy Kirk ... over at MSNBC obviously a member of a wet and cage or with them either by I guess about some of the violent rhetoric used by Democrats and recently she didn't like it wasn't willing to talk about it because obviously only one side of political ... bad and volatile and uses overheated rhetoric\nDo not want to run a room and I said to me and other politician other than Donald Trump say I'm so proud or or or or or or give kudos to another politician school body slammed reporter have you ever heard that from anyone else other than Donald Trump\nOkay the answer is no it's terrible right now it's terrible when President Trump says that also and it's terrible when Democrats ... ... people when they any should confront people in public places when Bernie Sanders claims that Republicans are going to kill millions of people with their health care plan\nTo pretend that the volatile political climate the United states is anything that was ridiculous but then there's been a long standing democratic tactic\nFor legitimately decades this actually is dangerous for the country for two reasons what a dangerous about me his take on this is when they suggest that rhetoric that does not inside violence is responsible for violence there criminalizing rhetoric and when they do it for only one side it appears that they only want to criminalize rhetoric on one side which leads people to believe that they are coming for you\nAnd to fail to acknowledge that has to fail to knowledge what driving a lot of our politics these days which is a reactionary feel that the other side is threatening you and its presence on both sides now let's get to the right wing response to all of this preemptively do there are people on the right I think most people on the right and said listen\nWe need to wait for more information here we don't know who did that most likely outcome is crazy person and I said that\nRepeatedly I said if you think that the all white attacking the jump to the conclusion falsified attack based on nothing but confirmation by you're doing it wrong there was a substantial sums grab them on the right that suggested that this had to be a Democrat had to meet somebody on the left who perpetrated that because obviously was convenient for Democrats in the run up the election\nThis sort of conspiracy the arising is not good either the reason that it is not good either is because it allows people to believe that there are no crazy on their own side that evil is entirely relegated to people who disagree with them it leads to more polarization\nAnd again it's not good for the country when you jump to conclusions based on your own confirmation bias\nAnd right now there's tremendous incentive to do just that\nThere's no incentive for people to say let's wait for more information was waiting for more information is one of the least popular sentences in American politics and usually right it's almost always right\nBut it's the least popular phrase because if you jump to a conclusion that jump to end up being like your site that back I get to know how you know you got that because it was right and you can get it and if you're wrong you're on the fact that as well that was right it's just the fact didn't fit in ... in the case but he still knows what\nSo jumping to conclusions and being incentivize on every side right now and it's really bad\nIt's particularly that when the president and the United states doesn't but when ... would generally just a couple of hours before the FBI arrested that thought that President Trump started tweeting about the bond stopped this morning so he treated out about you know it's funny I Love\nThe way to CNN and other can criticize Mitt will even blaming made for the current state of bombs and we're taking a snake comparing this to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing it when it criticized them they go out and screen it's just not presidential\nThat President Trump is correct about that one when he does the media rip him and he criticized summit will and when he when he respond think they'd like to temper eleventh or Oklahoma City and he's and he's creating that he's not wrong about that but here's what President Trump does go wrong they can't just stop there\nAt seven ...\nRepublicans are doing so well in any voting and at the polls and now that quote unquote bombs stuff happens and the momentum grace those new not talking politics very unfortunate what is going on Republican go out and the\nThe problem with people sending bombs in the mail not impact on voting its people putting bombs in the mail and he suggested that this is all just to Mr Right by the media when people send bombed and the males with a bunch of prominent democratic bigger no it is not and when you lend credence to conspiracy theories all you're doing is fueling the blamed the volatility\nEvery one adult basic bottom line of the show a lot of people talk right now coming up let's talk about how we can make the country's southwest and what we can do

racist so this was sort of predictable making Kelly was not getting good ratings in mourning and so they decided they wanted to dump her and then they found an excuse to dump her when she sat on a
