some of it out [noise] uh but there was a ton of it did make it in there\nOkay mom or your school arming they're all ... is just so terrible is just so awful I mean I Can't believe anything like that has ever happened at the White House black back just a few years Snoop Dogg went to the White House you know the great intellectual Snoop Dogg\nHe was the or snoop lion or whatever he calls himself these days whenever they're variety of animal from the animal kingdom he calls himself to follow snoop\nDogg because the White House and you know when he got at the White House here Snoop Dogg talking about how he spoke at the White House and everyone in the media thought this was hilarious and did you and when you've got a high\nBefore the White House did you also then smoke it up a little bit in the bathroom when you were there I was trying to get\nThrough you know what I'm saying like hey gee yes yes I Do view and nobody knew and I met the buffalo you miss it [laughter] you get him splitting

things have happened this office\nYou know great presidents had he was about FDR they sat\nMonica Lewinsky melt in his office\nI keep coming back to that because again if you're talking about the filing the oval office there they level beyond having Kanye West there and so the media again ignoring the fact that ... that were pregnant I Love that oh my God how could from hobnobbing with celebrity ... rock to the White House\nHere they picture of Jay Z and Beyonce in the situation room\nOne can't see the photo at the picture of Jay Z and Beyonce in the situation room and this was just all fun and games was just fun and games because God man gave him beyond their great technological they\nIt's all fun when it was on it and it was that it was ... going to the White House\nIt was awful and when it was on it and what they do in Kanye going to the White House and it just terrible and then you remember that you want to comment on that you remember common is a rapper\nWho had an ... ... song in ... an actual terrorists an actual terrorists\nOr he was in the White House but don't worry it's ... it did follow the White House in any way to have these folks you know comedy rap about supporting terrorism in the White House ... went there and kind of a sudden I thinking or mad at outlook what was really bad here it's common during the Obama administration\nIt's an honor to be here in the White House library the tiny Desk Concert series has tried to give voice to people who have something to say in our culture who move our culture forward and do amazing stuff and in that spirit NPR Music\nPresents comments and then I get\nThis with the White House Obama's White House you wanna talk about\nThis is a dirty little secret about a month old bottle with just much more celebrity driven the down from his lemony President Trump Obama with a celebrity president had no credentials when he became president he turn of the White House and to basically ... elaborate ... during ... and he did a fundraiser\nIn Las Vegas with Jay Z and Beyonce so the only talk about celebrity in the White House you got to start with Rocco by he was the guy who really turned the White House and the guy ... interview to call a Dell\nDell like the lady who pays any bath couple of fruit will\nCome on coming up the media obviously hate the economy I went to the White House but they said something about comedy that I\nCannot believe we have an air\nHe was once close with Ken car Daschle and he said I think that is great a great opportunity for young black entrepreneurs an artist to talk one on one with the president's the United states of America and he goes on to say this but and watching this hang from CNN he did say he's a little concerned um there is a concern right now\nTo the actual lover of a guy's wife\nIs just I mean is it that is not even beyond the bounds of journalistic I think that's on the on the mound period and just beyond that it's crazy stuff that is crazy why in the world would you think that regime has any need to offer to the situation except the one slept with chemical ...\nHow would that even on CNN\nCNN called news network and do that sort of thing\nThat's just garbage in garbage I think it's even worse than that so John Lennon who is a disgrace to the name of objective journalism it's amazing like there are people who I think tried to be objective on CNN I said before I think Jake Tapper\nVery often tries to be objective and tries to actually do his job done one that has has forced taken all\nRelationship with objectivity but still somehow calls himself an objective news reporter not an opinion journalists here is John Lennon\nIn invoking Kanye West dead mother to attack him\nHis bed and mother to attack him story this is just journalism guy so much in journalism and so much reporting happening right here\nThis was an embarrassment Conyers mother is rolling over in her grave I spoke to one of her friends who their check there was one of her friends today from Chicago job this rents are used to live there I Know she's gone to would be ... would be embarrassed by this\nIs that an okay thing is that what we're doing now are a lot of technical dead relatives you their dead relatives to attack them not\nTheir dead relatives in the sense that like their dead relatives did something wrong button and say a dead relatives who you didn't know and know nothing about an adult relationship with this man\nThat she would be ashamed of him\nThat should be ashamed up Kanye West\nThat that this is ... I'm Sorry they're just sick and the media is over ... reaction to the fact that Kanye West shows up in the White House is indicative of a couple of different things one is indicative of the fact that when a black person says they like President Trump\nThe media have no one like a black person who said they like President Trump no one because they have violated the attendance venture sexuality which suggest that we all think like our group we all think like our ethnic group so you break away from ethnic group or you break away from that sexual group that you're a gay person who like Trump or you're a woman who likes from any of those things in your at trader\nOr we saw this with all the women who supported Brett Kavanaugh\nThey were there were sex craters they've just given him the patriarchy they internalize The Handmaid's tale and now we see this with Connie what's the the black guy who's really wait on the inside an Oreo right\nOn these black on the outside the white on the inside he's he's in the trunk and place\nAs people are now paying rent it and that sort of stuff\nIs deeply red but that's why the weapon is so that was calling is because he breaks two of their rules wanting to black men's sports from not allowed\nTo use the celebrities support strong alternate all out\nFor people to understand how much from his hate in Hollywood\nHave to understand that in Hollywood if you even express it remotely right wing opinion you will never work again\nNever work again I I said before I had celebrities wouldn't they show their major April I'm not talking a celebrity and talking a clock celebrities who listen to the show\nAnd I visited with some of them I've had lunch or breakfast\nPeople come into the office for quite famous\nAnd I always tell them do not mentioned that you have been here if you wish to work in a town\nBecause the bias in Hollywood is so extreme that it doesn't matter you're sizes\nI Am in Hollywood is so extreme that it doesn't matter your size of celebrity if you said even associated with me\nAnd I didn't vote for Trump and twenty six day and if you say that you associated with me just a mainstream conservative was pretty reasonable\nMattered enough to lose your job\nLike that actually happened out here with markets locking just got destroyed red markets lost the guy who directed wild wild country on Netflix and he's done a bunch of other eat on the ... the Mindy project he's done a bunch of other stuff he came in here because you wanted to get a pro gun opinion from somebody for his new movie and they came in\nAnd I gave him like an an hour and a half and I've had him don't tell anyone you've been here because if you do it will look back on you\nAnd then he foolishly went on Twitter and said I was a nice guy and it ended his world\nHe was attacked so harshly on Twitter he deleted this week and then put it between apologizing for ever having tweeted that I was in I die\nBy apologizing for that\nThat's how it works in Hollywood so county has broken tools a black man and extraordinarily payments and if you are a black extraordinarily famous person you are not allowed to be pro Trump and you're not allowed to be concerned with it anyway you have the total liberal line\nAnd you wonder why did you send your great shock and dismay Taylor Swift came out and embrace the Democratic party because if you do not embraced the Democratic party and you are a celebrity they will tearing down\nAnd we're on the right joke for a long time about the fact that that Taylor Swift and not that anything politically because what's going on her to say something politically will eventually should it because she finally was pressured into it\nBut we'll talk a little bit more about this plus

club dot complex than that dollar shave club dot com slash but already so\nLet's talk for one moment more about the celebrities that we've got plenty of tools black men celebrity can support president or either of these\nThe polls are showing that President Trump actually have a shot at breaking out of the five to ten percent box Republicans have been in in the black community for a long time and that's because as it turns out that they talked about yesterday\nMinorities are not wedded to evoke social justice warrior version of politics Democratic Party wants to embrace ... and showing that right now and that is good because there is an important signaling element the belief that it's okay to break out of the box that when you expand the Overton window which is what ... is doing right now\nThen people have the ability to think more freely more publicly that's quite a good thing and I think we should be grateful to ... for that even if we don't like the celebrity politics in which we are engaged and even if we think that all of this is quite do it and say well we'll talk about all that probably a little more next week and we'll talk about it\nOn our Fox News election special

sleep have a meal and take a drive thanks for all you do well\nAfter years of doing it you sort of get used to the fact that you're not going to get the news and see that sort of chomping at the vet\nIs there is a radical shift in sort of the pace of life on Sabbath and on young 'til the holiday\nI even though in the newspaper columns and somebody who is ensconced in Internet news which is instantaneous\nPrint new is always you know twenty four hours behind basically so I usually know everything that was in the newspaper on Saturday already by friday afternoon but with all of that said I find a refreshing I mean it's nice though the worst thing is coming off of south right when you come off from Saturday and you just get hit with the tsunami of notice that it's kind of difficult but\nI I've I've gotten over I think the desire to ... it's actually really actually get to do what I call my curious reading my non news based reading they'll philosophy or deep history\nWhere I get sort of my background knowledge from ... ... what do you think is the best major city in America the way the weather is a factor thanks wanted to show well I mean whether if weather is a factor than San Diego's about that in America I mean San Diego's whether it's just spectacular year round it is just great all the time in terms of ... you're just great American cities\nYou know I Lived in Boston for three years aside from or whether it was an ethics but that's a big aside from because I went to Boston and we go in late August for the start of the school year\nAnd they talk to you because late August is beautiful in Boston late August and September just great and then it's October\nFrom October to April it's just garbage and it's just sweet and rain and snow and then you get like three weeks of night school years over so you got like six weeks combined things being great and the rest of it was just at Boston's a great historic city it's a lot of fun to be there\nWhen you can actually move around and so I I I did enjoy Boston Washington DC is is fun to visit a it's ...\nI I like the scene but only for short periods of time because I just can't take it anymore I like they're just too many federal employees I Can't handle it\nA New York I Am not a huge fan of it I've stayed on the program\nThat is because I grew up in suburbia in New York you can't see the guy so I actually start to get and see if I can see this guy of all I can see the liberal sky between tall building and I know New Yorkers have inordinate pride in in the city and they showed it it's one of the great cities of the world it's just not a place that I think I Would love to live\nAnd I am biased toward my home town of Los Angeles all those kind of frequently shabby because of their at their
