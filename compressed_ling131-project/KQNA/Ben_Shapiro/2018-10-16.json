blaming it and then apologized for having done so like five years ago\nThere were a couple of good reasons here the thing there was a story that came out the ... of this year in the Boston Globe and it just got a serious issue for all of this war\nWas Senator Warren actually\nA professor at Harvard law because she clean Native American ancestry in other words wishing granted special status that sort of gave her in an upper hand when it came to her job at University of Pennsylvania or at Harvard law school was more article from the Boston Globe ended up research found that\nPoked at Harvard said that her Native American claims had nothing to do with any of that that her Native American claimed had nothing to do with our actual ability\nTo be granted professorship at Harvard law school they interviewed to like thirty one professor of many of them are on the admissions many coming from I Know people like Charles Fried who I have a contract and can know when we hire or it had nothing to do with her clinic Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that it's time we assume she was white and the internal documents suggested\nThat University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person and sort of Harvard law school until it became beneficial for them to claim\nThat you as a minority heritage for purposes of their diversity curriculum or they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of take it and said that she was Native American but that doesn't mean she got her job based on Native American Native American claims\nWas so would that said why didn't Elizabeth Warren a month and a half ago simply say look\nI was told by my family members that I had Cherokee after my mom used to tell me that my uncle than answers to told me that and because of that I simply assume that they're right I Want to assume that my relatives were lying to me the story that I was growing up I guess that was wrong\nAnd so I never should have done any of that stuff but it didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory my career trajectory was going to be great no matter what and had nothing to do with those claims so I Apologize Native Americans are having taken seriously the story of my family without checking them but with that said\nTo claim that I was a beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action is simply untrue\nWell there are two reasons she didn't do that and both of them are telling reasons number one she figure that she could get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her\nWhich the media did yesterday there were headlines in the Daily Beast saying Elizabeth Warren Peru was Native American ancestry there was a headline over at CNN Elizabeth Warren provide solid evidence of Native American ancestry\nSo she was generally threw out a study that showed was not Native American and counted on the media to say that the study showed you was actually Native American\nAnd then it all began to fall apart because people can read\nAnd that meant that her narrative began to collapse in on her\nSo she thought she can get away with it because the media would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean to me I have covered for the fact that they don't work in Texas with being treated as an Obama at Kennedy esque new young figure\nThat that guy was involved in a DUI when he was twenty six then bumped him crossing over a median line smashing a truck and then trying to ... from the scene and they're still having him is the big new neck democratic thing now looking I'm somebody who had my license suspended for driving too fast\nAnd obvious about that I was not driving drunk and I didn't crack into anybody with on an empty freeway they don't or war was driving drunk and hit a diet and then tried to flee the scene while he was drunk\nAnd the media have basically said that big nothing as the media that said that George W. Bush and the why back in the Nineteen seventies disqualified him in two thousand for money for the presidency like two weeks before the election\nSo Elizabeth Warren had good cause to think the media we're going to cover for her no matter what\nIf the media cover Democrats the way they called the Republican half of the candidates for Congress in this election cycle would be told they would be finished Bob Menendez of New Jersey would be done\nIn the ... honestly he'd be gone\nClaire McCaskill in Missouri would be done course in cinema in Arizona would be just hope but they're not because only ... like every other Democrat knows that there is a great\nAs a as a buffer zone\nThat at this tablet for democratic candidate and so she can lay claim Native American ancestry without any proof and the media will continue to cover for her as much as humanly possible right and then it'll just continue to cover for her endlessly\nThat's the reason number one that Elizabeth Warren\nFelt comfortable releasing it studied actually contradicted her main narrative one coming up the second\nRate than there was a before and self in it that that needs to continue cleaning Native American ancestry even though she was about someone we states had seven frightening she had no Native American ancestry we'll talk about it there's a bunch of girls\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri\nAnd James O'Keefe\nTight race in Missouri\nAnd James O'Keefe the kind of undercover journalist\nIs going to shock journalists over a project ... he's on some good work before he sent his workers indeed than some of his folks into Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she is campaigning far to the right of where she actually is on the issue here is some of what that sounded like\nYou I can tell them because she does she do their traumatic for [noise]\n'cause I went to a certain amount of money like a semi automatic over which is\nLike for\nHer because she's an intern\nKato she's basically been fitting about her own positions so Claire McCaskill was in trouble in Missouri course in Panama just three weeks ago was leading Martha ... valley and the Arizona Senate race and now it turns out that all of her path to come out according to my case so Kirsten Sinema is the Democratic nominee in Arizona according to the Washington Examiner\nShe apparently takes sorcery very seriously emails obtained by the Washington Examiner show cinema was invited to a prominent come in a feminist which is in Arizona it was called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day\nAnd to protest the war in March of two thousand three coping protesters were paying obviously nothing the women and black were black but send them to encourage the which is where colorful clothing income ready to dance coral and stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nAnd send them a campaign would not say why she invited the witches or clarify why she thought members of vehicles deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning more peace which is in question is should be noted claimed to practice only non violent magic pretty about section on their Web page there is a peaceful and democratic kind of sorcery\nOpinion cluster focuses on sharing spiritual insights and participating in direct democracy divisions are decided liberal many of their carbon quote have roots in the reclaiming tradition of feminist witchcraft\nMhm cinema also into an anti war rally with pay and later that year and a apparently she talked about singing and spiraling into pagan circle only five rose from the police wine\nI and then the police arrested everybody so Kirsten than him up\nAnd just doing humans work on behalf of her own campaign\nAlso it turns out she organized for the Arizona alliance for peace and justice in one email she urged supporters of the a P J to dilute to deluge the phone line of a radio show hosted by an unapologetic unconditional supporter of Israeli policies ... not is basically posts in that Senate race as well Democrats radicalism\nIs the major issue here and all they have is President Trump which is why it's not good that the president of the United states those around calling women horse they I mean really does yeah we'll get to more of that in just one second the Democratic response to all the kind of shocking story Carter Page is now suing the folks\nOver at fusion GPS will get to all of that in just a second but first let's talk about your sleep quality so there's nobody on the planet like it why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else helix fleet they'll just leave it takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to natural body type and sleep preferences for the perfect mattress\nWhether you're aside sleep or a hot tub or whether you like a pleasure from bed with healing there is no more guessing and no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes week was and they will match you to a mattress that will give you the best sweep of your life for a couple he looked can even split the mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and feel preferences for each side\nOf a ten year warranty you get and tried out for a hundred nights risk free right now he is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all ... into a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he likes link dot com slash Shapiro as helix sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nFor a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro I Love our he would sleep mattress no much\nThat I went out and got one for my sister for her wedding it's just that comfortable it's just that convenient my wife and I took that to me that sleep mattress came in the mail we popped up in the box in the way we put it right on the bed friend who was going to go in super comfortable helix sleep dot com slash Shapiro for the special deal\nSo with all of the set\nWith all of us that the the economy continues to do while this was such a good news cycle it really was it was such a good news cycle the economy was doing great\nThen then new job numbers are just terrific\nWe have the highest federal collection of income taxes in history and twenty Eighteen\nSo if you if you just look at the numbers we're collecting more income taxes than ever before even though we have lower income tax rate than we did last year why because supply side economics works when the economy grows and the government actually takes in more taxes and if the economy is stagnant and we have higher tax rate the economy has been going great guns under President Trump will get to the deficit and the second which is not quite as good but\nThis is a very good news cycle for President Trump's in the last three weeks got U.S Supreme court justice and watch leapt kill themselves over Capitol you got to lose with Lauren and one of the great on force political wonders in my lifetime releasing report saying she was Native American when she is less she's west Indian than actual people from India\nLike actual people from India have more Native American blood that Elizabeth Warren ... it's an amazing thing\nAnd with that said President Trump decides to step on himself with Stormy Daniels and calling people core state this is the only line of attack that Democrats have is just the tax on President Trump and so this is what they're actually on Nancy Pelosi was looking at a bad Senate map right now\nShe's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the touting that the reason that President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi Government with regard to the murder of Jamal because Shockley their alleged ... an American residents who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also a than a Muslim Brotherhood\nShe says the reason from hasn't been harsher is 'cause maybe he's being paid off by the doubting\nAnd turned to Saudi Arabia I think that was that I always wondered why he went to the first country to visit ... to the United states of course as president of the United states and all the other presidents that to Ronald Reagan went to [noise]\nTo Canada or if you want to Mexico grape juice you know the Bush to enter hemisphere where there are many friends and allies who could have gone to so there was I was always suspicious that there was some kind of financial transaction involved there whether for his businesses or what ever\nGood luck with this line of attack it it's pretty crazy that the that Democrats think the only way that they're going to be able to win election just by simply throwing out on verified and and verifiable information like this but it shows how desperate they are which is why again on force errors are the biggest problem for the ministry and they've always been the biggest problem for the for the menace ration\nHere's here's I think the rule in American politics right now whoever's shuts up first one's really because this is just it's the worst tennis match ever\nAnd if you if you watch tennis players ... very often you'll see that that sometimes that strategy is just get the ball over the net because sooner or later somebody is going to smack the ball into the net and then when\nThey said that there is a great line which which comedian is it I think Mitch Hedberg is that ... that the name of the comedian on and so he has a line he says no matter how the the problem I have a tendency to no matter how good I got I'm never better than the wall\nWell that's that's essential that what's happening American politics right now\nIf you are the wall you win\nIf you are the wall you win that's all if you are the person who just sit there and let the other side banging his head against you in\nIf you're the person who commits on for ...\nIf you're the person who commits on ...\nThe Democrats have been committing an forced air after an forced air here\nAnd that's why it would be great if the president would just stop but and again I guess we're going to have an entire new cycle now about ... does it hurt Trump in any way not really but it does jazz up the Democrats again their minds and how much they hate President Trump when he goes away it's hard for them to talk about this as much nobody cares\nBut that said that Trump Trump Trump that just the way that have gone now\n... also comes along with the benefit of right and then there's always a good side to what Trump is in a bad tied to what Trump is so the same guy who called his former lovers ... is the same fellow who's actually trying to stop the immigrant caravan that have been traveling from places like Honduras\nSo President Trump on Tuesday threatened with raw owning an aid from Honduras if it does not stop the caravan of people that had is heading to the United states\nFrom the United states has strongly informed the president of Honduras that at the large caravan of people heading to the U.S has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given Honduras effective immediately\nUp to three thousand migrants crops from Honduras in Guatemala on Monday on a track northward effort down of police in riot gear and warnings from Washington the migrants should not try to enter the United states illegally and then the crowd more than doubled in size and they do this\nAnd they do this march every year where people are set up from Latin America through Central America and to the United states for Trump threatening to withdraw aid from countries that don't stop that seems\nNot completely unreasonable make but that that he should be threatening Saudi Arabia as well based on their human rights violations and frankly any country that commit human rights violations and the way the Saudi Arabia has I'm not sure why we should be funding those country\nEspecially when we have the capacity to do much more direct damage for run through sanctions and through military no how than the Saudis do I mean the Saudis basically are there because we let them be they're coming
