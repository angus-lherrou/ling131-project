God shooting in Pittsburgh just a\nHorrible horrible weekend well let's let's jump into than it over the weekend obviously the worst in mentioning attack in the history of the United states eleven people\nMurdered in a synagogue during what we call a Brittany law a breath which is where an eight day old boy it circumcised and the baby naming ceremony takes place at that point isn't the conservative synagogue not politically conservative than a dog a religiously conservative synagogue in Judaism in American journalism anyway\nThere are several branches of Judaism I'm an Orthodox Jew which means deeply observing keep that don't write on ... keep kosher there's conservative Judaism which is sort of less orthodox people drive on Saturday sort of a form of that\nOr they don't keep kosher but they have certain respect parts of our laws in any case\nLet's concern in Santa got didn't have much security and an anti Semitic white supremacists ... mile walk into the synagogue the armed with an effort needed to shoot up the Brits me liking the screaming at the time all Jews might die so obviously settled fella\nSo why does it matter first of all I I think that we need to get something off the table right away when an anti Semitic attack occurs you generally don't need to bother blaming particular politicians anti Semitism literally as old as the u._s. people literally is older than us people\nNow they're politicians and how will call for anti Semitism their politicians in the past will actually called for the murder of June\nAnd not paying a lot of those on today's American thing there are a lot of politicians on Native American ... who have not with anti Semite who make common cause with anti kind of don't get to all of that in just a second but\nFolks who are blaming the left or the right for the anti Mexican happened yesterday white supremacy and anti Semitic attacks on June had existed for decades in the country long before anything that is going on in today's politics and that's not downplay what's happening in politics as what the rest of the show is going to be about\nBut let's just be clear about that when it comes to attack on June there is nothing new under the sun legitimately nothing new under the sun I don't really singled you\nSaid they singled Jew who is not one degree removed from a violent attack on the job and that's not saying that America's violent country project and it's not America in the country in world history African\nAmericans and incredible play cricket but because the Jewish population is so small and they got so many to know each other and because\nThe June ... consider themselves and extended family just as questions considered themselves and extended religious family\nIt's difficult not to feel it deeply obviously when when an attack like that take place the history of the Jewish people are still the fractious divisions but history history and the Jews and the court closely bound unit Jewish identity isn't really a choice it's a reality\n... scared that for a lot of trees but the fact is that all Jews are in the same boat when it comes anti semi like that and then they say every Jew is one degree removed from some level of anti Semitic violent I live in Los Angeles community I'm probably if not the most prominent Orthodox Jew in the country\nThe most prominent orthodox you're wearing ... in the country I think would be fair to say I walk around in public with the ... that felt safe I think this country I live in a city with them nine hundred thousand kids what Angeles had nine hundred thousand his living in the city\nStill anti Semitic attacks have occurred in the LA Jewish community since I was a child in Nineteen Ninety One and then it got cut down the block from me was firebombed in Nineteen Ninety nine a white supremacist broke\nFirebombs in Nineteen Ninety nine a white supremacist drove past the high school that I Would attend a year later\nCheck it out and then proceeded to drive over to the west valley J. D. C. and shoot it up and two thousand to a radical Muslim terrorists walking the El Al counter at LAX and shot up the El Al counter killing a member of my community when I tend to be sure of the University of high school was angel is we had bomb scares bomb threats\n\nThis was an amazing story one guy Stephen and Malika Gregory in Nelson New Zealand\nI understand that Maliki who's eight

social media are very focused in on President Trump's fault everything is President Trump's fault because he was\nWinking and nodding at the alt right in twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen as I say and has said many times over I Would there I remember I condemned it I don't condemn it by the fact is we need to be honest about that let's be clear about that when president from\nPride to wink and nod and you All right he was taking a fringe group a fringe group\nThat was not associated with the conservative movement and he was winking and nodding it them for political purposes and then he talk them out on the air which is why they're angry with him the mainstream Democratic Party the mainstream Democratic Party and the left in the country have decided that it is perfectly fine to hobnobbing with people who support anti Semitic terrorism\nThey've decided that's okay I'm not blaming her folks what happened in Pittsburgh that's not their fault either\nBut if we're going to talk about rhetoric and its impact on anti Jewish sentiment the world over I don't know what the folks who every time there was a war in the Gaza Strip suggests that you're in the world over are to blame or suggest that Israel is to blame for defending itself or suggest that when Jews are attacking a kosher supermarket in France\nBut that it it's a random attack\nWhen they were going to condemn I reckon that Margaret I'm happy to separate rhetoric from violence I'm having to that on all sides are going to talk rhetoric you have to condemn rhetoric when it happens where it happened and from whom it can't pay I condemned to President Trump when he was candidates from doing this nonsense but the alright I did it over and over and over\nAt the same thing with both on the line I don't see anyone on the left doing the same thing to folks on the left I can only doing it to folks on the right for part of the political reasons that's all I'm seeing I'm seeing a bunch of people who don't get a good damn when did you get killed in Jerusalem\nOut of the woodwork and say that the white is responsible for what just happened in Pittsburgh all the while championing an Iran deal the ... millions of people if uranium have their way\nAs disgusting partisanship\nAnd I'll show you that sort of partisanship in just a second\nBecause that's the point that we're actually going to talk about policy what separate rhetoric and policy for just a second\nWant a thousand time when anti Semitic writer or rhetoric that anti Semitism takes place I Will condemn when strongly as I hadn't even go back and looked into the show I've done it every step of the way against people on all sides I don't care I'll keep doing it because it's the right thing to do\nI'll do the same thing with racist rhetoric I'm happy to do it on every side\nCan now let's talk about policy which pelican getting ... was killed here to talk about policy the lead the Jews dying\nAny president for policy\nAnd the Obama administration lie to the American people and promoted in Iran deal that gave the mullahs the clear pathway to a nuclear weapon\nPresident from not only move the embassy to Jerusalem yelled cut off aid to the anti Semitic the anti Semitic openly in Medicare supporting Palestinian Authority Obama ... tried to make Israel make concessions to the camera\nAnd bombing in this race in the middle of the Gaza warranty thousand fourteen threatened to cut off military supplies and the Israeli your mom administration\nWas just blatantly not only anti Israel\nFrom a promotional wing of of progressive juice for progressive wisdom came person Judaism came back and\nHave you even talk about policy that led to a dead Jews forget they are not the location\nThan you actually have to talk about but we're not going to talk about any of that stuff obviously we're not going to talk about any of that stuff\nNow to talk about how the media ... responded because it's ... it's just tremendously dishonest so let's start with a media story\nCame currency ... I'm Sorry this is all this deeply upsetting the clip that because we should all be on the same time when it comes anti Semitism I think we probably all would be on the same side when it comes down to some of them but nobody has actually willing to call it anti Semitism and when and where exits on any side unless they're busy defending their own political side and their own political high it's disgusting\nAnd the media are complicit in the ... airport or from I generally have respect and the New York times just wait it out today\nA letter to President Trump from Pittsburgh Jewish leaders\nAnd it's a headline that was created by a variety of media group Washington Post he is not welcome here thousand support Pittsburgh Jewish leaders calling on Trump to denounce white nationalism the hill progressive Jewish leaders tell from not welcoming Pittsburgh until he denounces white nationalism Newsweek\nJewish groups that Donald Trump not welcoming Pittsburgh until he's ready to fully denounce white nationalism\nComing up the media have suggested over and over and over\nNow headlined the Jewish leaders are condemning President Trump\nOr even find a common to Pittsburgh Saturday live is an absolute lie I Will show you then there's all I have the evidence and Arab media ran with it any way that they didn't engineer\nEveryone is entitled to their opinion the question is whether that opinion is good or not like apple Julian dropping to do or opinion sucks\nRight here with her who her second take on the\nAwards my fellow Americans use the president makes it possible here where you live I helped me\nOh American Jews the president makes it possible here where you live I Hope the embassy move over there where you don't live was worth it because you know accusing Jews in the United states voted for President Trump or support President Trump now I'll do a loyalty they care about Jews in Israel but not Jews in America because the president is getting killed in America well he's being pro Israel\nExcept for the fact that the shooter specifically hated President Trump and except for the fact that you don't get to blame Jews for how they vote on June getting killed about blaming the victim\n... anybody ... at the synagogue voted\nMaybe they voted for Trump maybe they didn't it doesn't matter you don't get to blame people for the death of other people when they have no connection to the death of other people\nBut didn't want the weapons decided to do they decided that every bad thing that happens in the country from an evil person has to be the result\nOf President Trump's rhetoric now again I condemned to President Trump when it came to the all white stuff but you can't show me the connection that it's solid between what happened at the Pittsburgh Senegal and President Trump's outright stuff number one and number two\nIf we're going to talk about rhetoric that leads to violence against Jews that's going to open a whole can of worms I don't think the last one to open\nIn ... she was just\nAn idiot and many of these Ralph he's Ralphie from from The Simpsons over and over ... weed out about teams college in this morning's attack as a reminder that anti Semitism and other forms of bigotry still persists in our society and must be confronted in combat at every turn\nUgly just we didn't even do it without the baggage and every Republican is responsible for white nationalist shooting up attended ...\n... I'm an Orthodox Jew this is a lie is a lie I go to synagogue way more than any of the people who I quoted so far on the show\nAnd not only that I'm seeing an argument being made well get to this and the second and gun control argument that as being made by folks on the left in response to all of this you know my response to all of us said I'm going to start carrying a gun to school\nAnd that's my response to all of that\nMy responses Jews should be armed people in synagogues should be arm\nAnd you know why because white nationalist are not going to give up their gun\nEvil people don't give up there done that means I Want more people at my school arm I Will or security guards at my ... gets all of that in just a second but first\nLet's talk about life insurance life insurance is certainly not most enjoyable thing to talk about most people don't like to think about what happens after God Forbid something happens to you but actually having life insurance is a really good feeling it's nice to know that if anything were to happen your family won't have started off on me\nPolicy genius has the easy way to get life insurance on line and just two minutes you can compare quote from the top insurers to find the best policy for you and when he compared what you have money it is indeed that simple policies unions and help them with one million people shop for insurance\nThey placed over twenty billion dollars in coverage they don't just do life insurance out the disability insurance and auto insurance home insurance if you care about it they can cover itself\nIf you've been avoiding getting life insurance because it's typically are confusing if policy genius of try just go to policy genius dot com get your quotes applying minutes into the whole thing on your phone right now policy geniuses indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance there is no reason for you to put it off it's actually a responsible for you\nNot to have life insurance policy genius makes everything really easy because again in two minutes you can compare quotes from the top insurance and find the best policy for you go to save money policy genius dot com and the easy way to compare and buy like insurance\nSo they say members in the Democratic left have decided that when an anti Semitic shooting takes place in Pittsburgh that has nothing to do with President Trump it's obviously President Trump's fault\nAnd they've continued with this narrative Franklin for who is a columnist over the Atlantic in order to full column basically on this idea that members of the Jewish community who support Republicans are responsible he tweeted\nHe organized shutting up Sheldon Adelson jerk question or another Jewish enablers as a matter of protecting the security of the community\nSo they got this right being mean to Jared Kushner is now going to prevent shootings it's ended up being mean to Sheldon Adelson one of the great supporters of Israel in the United states and one of the great supporters of Jewish programs like birth rate in the United states that it's somehow going to make you safer in the United states\nSo if you're ... or ... Keith Ellison or if you like a bunch of Democrats who openly hobnobbing\nWith windows are sore and that makes you say for ... if you Shaun the most pro Israel president in American history\nAnd any Jews who support that President\nEven while condemning his rhetoric than you are somehow making the Jewish community safer\nAnd then you get from like Adam Schiff and Democrat from California because President Trump set the tone of hatred this is an easy argument always\nAgain there was just an extension of the argument made last week about the bombing attempt against democratic members that rhetoric in is what causes violence I\nDon't remember any of these conversations happening on mainstream television after Bernie Sanders supporters shot up a bunch of Congress people on the congressional baseball field I don't remember the conversations happening for longer than two days it was out of the headlines immediately now we're going to get nothing but this for months because this was always let let's be clear about something this was always going to be the Democratic narrative\n... owner has nothing to do as President Trump and President Trump plays right into the heart of it because you can't shut his face but\nThis has almost nothing to do with President Trump is this happening under President Bush you get the same crap if this happened under President Romney you get the same crap\nPeople on the left practicing jet that I was responsible for the bombing attempt last week\nThey're both on the left who tried to suggest that eyeball responsibility for what happened in Pittsburgh\nAnd you can you can separate out all these issues you can condemn bad rhetoric when you see it on any side without doing this routine is part of an ... job where Adam Schiff that suddenly the great arbiter of decent rhetoric in the middle of a terrible political time\nNo one set the tone for the president and the states and the tone that he was one of division often when a patron of sometimes one of insights into violence against journalists a and there's no escaping or collective responsibility but there's always scraping the tone of your search for the country\nOkay it's just the again I agree that President from that are better at home for the country can blame President Trump's tone for everything that has happened searching for is insane him into the country was already off the rails by twenty twelve it's been years since we've had a decent political conversation in this country is getting very very long time\nBut let's not pretend that the world started spending when President Trump suddenly entered the political stand a scene and let's stop pretending that the Democratic party has clean hands when it comes to association with anti Semite\nAnd one of the one of the more ... attacks on on Trump and folks on the right is he suggesting that if you are critical of George Soros who are somehow anti Semitic\nSo there's been a big narrative put out by folks on the left\nThat George Soros who has a lead democratic donor that if you criticized George Soros by injecting that he gets a lot of money to cause is there enough area than this means that your somehow anti Semitic\nNow you can attach or swords in an anti Semitic way you can think Jessica is part of the Jewish ball attempting to run the country but it seems to me that the criticism of George Soros on the right on the mainstream right has been\nNo more market than the criticism Sheldon Adelson unless\nIt seems to me that the criticism of George Soros is very much akin to the criticism of the Koch brothers on the left\nAnd yet the idea now is that we're going to spend every critique of George Soros into this is all about George Soros in Jewish heritage which is nonsense\nBut again CNN is pushing us\nAround and say you're blaming them are you blaming them\nAnd blaming them for pretty much guess on the air and not you know correct and get him in real time and I so far so I go twelve hours later drink I think about it and I believe me honestly this low after we have soccer grocer the lower income and I've known in the street from the ... on TV every night on blaming the management of Fox than the investors father when he's talking\nAbout here and there was a far in this cat who said that the caravan had something to do with the ... the Soros run State Department or something like that and now that anti Semitic know him any idiotic but it's not anti Semitic hey George Soros doesn't run the state department but the idea that\nBut it's not anti Semitic endorsed north up and run the apartment but the idea that going after George Soros and then the various force in American politics is somehow inherently in medical ridiculous and the same way as and jumping the going after Sheldon Adelson inherently anti Semitic when he's a major donor to the Republican Party\nThat advocates are looking for an hour and they found a convenient narrative and again I'm not going to pretend I'm not going to pretend that the left as clean hands when it comes to fighting anti Semitism and they certainly not in the women's march pointed out their sympathy for all of that and it's when it's something that we are turning our grief to action with\nA Jewish act and then a clear message that the Americans you know like a tax can never happen again ever not D.C turning around ... watching for the last ... the women's march including she'll head women who don't get openly and offend would Derek on\nI'm not interested in your health waiting\nAnd you with your user denounced the anti Semitism in your own met they not interested in solidarity event in New York City Al Sharpton showed up at the solidarity of them\nIs already more power than in ... and that's\nMarsha Blackburn unity event leftist came and they disrupt in a unity of anti Semitism anti anti anti Semitic immunity that was not for black or the ... the kind of the senatorial candidate to shut up gray matter\nFew hours protesters interrupted a rally for Congress\nSenator Lindsey Graham and west national at race even capital throughout the events off for people taking out at least are just living is hanging off\nOkay like now the final narrative eleven is trying to try it out they brought out a few narratives one is that it was Trump's fault too and it was Jews and support from fault not very convenient doesn't it very convenient I just got to say all the things you can say about people hate normally now you get the blame them for murder\nA all the all the while supporting a party that routinely undermine\nIsrael and into the into the open anti Semite and they're very convenient\nComing up another narrative the media have tried it out in response to the tree of life and the guy is a force on control because there's always some control was half about what this means and white French here", "show_name": "Ben Shapiro", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day":
