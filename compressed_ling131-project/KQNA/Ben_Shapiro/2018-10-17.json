over the future direction of the American economy and it it sort of across the political Baron is really quite interesting\nOn one hand you have folks you take globalization and redistribution what do we do with the people who are left behind or working jobs that get eliminated\nNow the normal answer in the past was get up get a new skill\nLeaked out that's why America spans from coast to coast and it and just relegated to the eastern seaboard\nBecause people legitimately gave up plots of land in New York\nAnd decided I'm going to go out to the middle of nowhere and across territory where people want to kill me that would walk in the middle of nowhere to set up a claim and then I'm going to work on that claimed by myself at risk of death in or is that I can make something more myself but that is the American ideal but that's where it was going by the wayside because we now believe that\nEverybody is entitled to things were entitlement culture and so what is broken down is to separate use of where the economy should go from here\nEven number one is globalization redistribution free markets everywhere and if people are left behind than we have a a basic income but a universal basic income or we have a social welfare net a safety net\nAnd that's how we pick up for the folks get left behind\nLike those people we just give them money basically the ... and everybody want to get her and then everybody who is left behind a little that we give them a little bit of extra money to make them feel better and that they can live better as model number one\nAnd a lot of folks in sort of the Trump camp said that's not right and the burning camp say that's not right they say instead we really need is a new model of how to thing and the model of how to think about job how do we provide jobs for people because jobs provide meaning\nThat if you don't have a job you have less meaning so what do we restricted the free market itself what do we put barriers on the free market\nTo orange credit orange cat he doesn't really ... were were recommend tons of restrictions on the free market he talked about different ways that we can shape public policy in order to make the markets freer actually relieve regulations to make it easier to generate jobs but President Trump has suggested restrictions on the free market he's ... he has suggested\nRestrictions on global trade for example\nAnd there's a real push by someone that from populist right to restore\nUnion power even though it is Americans voluntarily moving out of the union not companies breaking unions that have led to the dark union in the United states\nSo that model number two and you were struck me free market economy in order so that everybody has a job and that again is more of a left leaning version so it's kind of fascinating 'cause you have liberals who are for globalization indeed and redistribution neoconservatives or for globalization and redistribution and you have liberals who are for workers\nAnd not free markets and you have conservatives who are for workers enough market\nNow the actual answer to this problem is\nLook at what free markets to\nLook at what free markets do at a President Trump were really a free market minded guy that's what he would be saying right now he me ... all you do is just one is an ad in the county and then you know you're all worried about technological development you're worried about automated cars and trucks and all the rest of it well guess what\nThere is no question that that capitalism has a process of creative destruction attached to it\nLike to shop or the payment economy coined the term creative destruction that every time a new industry has created old industries are destroyed the car industry destroyed the horse and buggy industry we'll write when out of business there were literally people whose job it was to make when we'll and they went out of business when cars came around\nBut guess what that created a new job in the car industry and new jobs and making parts for those cars in other words certain jobs get destroyed that we can all live a better lifestyle and people have to learn to adapt and Asia and at the history of humanity forget capitalism the history of humankind is adapting and adjusting to the environment around you\nThis idea that we can't adapt and adjusting new technology seems to me completely wrong headed\nAll the talk about how all these jobs are simply going to disappear thanks to technology and how we have to restore manufacturing job by restricting the free market it's a big mistake the recently led the most prosperous like any human beings have ever lived in the history of time\nIs because of these free market I think this debate is not only premature I think it's wrong headed there's under four percent unemployment in the United states right now for ... percent unemployment there seven million unfilled jobs\nBefore we destroy a system that create this sort of prosperity might want to think twice coming up President Trump now in trouble again this time not really his fault the Saudi Government apparently\nFound an enemy and cut them up and listen to fight him and this became public knowledge and now President Trump and having to deal with the fallout will talk about how you can deal with fallout and why the media treatment of president on the kind of unfair his is a venture to Russia\nCommitting human rights violations that we all know they've been committing for years on it I mean this is the same Saudi administration\nThat has been quite friendly with radical Muslims for decades on and the vast majority\nMuslims for decades on and\nThe vast majority of the of the ... of the nine eleven hijackers were Saudi so if I didn't say the Saudi regime is not exactly\nA wonderful wonderful regime but doesn't mean the United states doesn't have interests with regard to Saudi Arabia as an example of president from saying the sort of thing where he like he was asked about Helsinki or you remember he had that meaning in Helsinki was led recruiting where he was very complimentary up food and\nIt was not his mind is our first Reagan who has a brand new show on Fox Business which is what we're watching she pressed President Trump on Helsinki here's what Trump had to say\nThey want me to go up and have a boxing match with among shit was and I said to him I was in the gym but what happened is when I walked off the stage everyone so that was great for on the plane all of a sudden the fake news you know it's an old ... tough enough and let me tell you if I was you know as a solution [noise]\nI could have a very good relationship with Russia having a good relationship with Russia would be a good thing not a bit\nOkay so there was there that read to him when he says that about Russia he said the same sort of thing about Kim Jong il right this is how Trump act with regards to bad dictator he basically determines whether he needs them or not\nAnd then you have to treat them nicely if you need them because this is how Trump is personally with all the people he deals with\nIf you need you he's very nice you if he doesn't need you then he called you a horse race as what President Trump does and so when people are confused that President Trump isn't calling mom and been sold on a horse they just because that's not how President Trump operate that does not mean however that what the left says about Trump's relationship with Saudi Arabia is true so Ben Rhodes who is just the worst Ben Rhodes a former national\nSecurity adviser to President Trump\nHe jumped off all he's just awful he was the guy who lives in the American people about the Iran deal he was the leader of the Iranian regime outreach effort on the part of the Obama administration the actual outreach effort to an evil dictatorship believe sponsor of ... on planet earth attacking President Trump suggesting trumpet somehow responsible\nFor Saudi Arabia acting like Saudi Arabia journalist\nEverywhere are less safe and and let's face it we have a president who say Israel to the I mean the two of values like freedom of speech in the sense\nThat suddenly are very endangered around the world and that's in mind that I think is getting much worse and and so this vacuum of any advocacy for democratic values I think is putting people at risk and there's nobody else who's going to fill that vacuum if the president United States in the United states of America is not doing that okay\nThis is why Trump supporters are not going to resonate anything me are saying he said the media covered for in ministry ... outreach to actual terrorists for years upon years upon years\nSo when Trump says listen I'm not going to go crazy over the Saudi thing most Americans are basically going to say okay well All right\nNow is that the proper action not a proper action is probably the sanctions that the very least an insistence on some sort of change in Saudi Arabia but we do have leverage over the Saudis to pretend we do is foolish but\nYou know President Trump is much more of a foreign policy realist than some of his predecessors and\nAnd the foreign policy realist I think that it is not\nFully outside the bounds of propriety for him to suggest that it's\nIt's a little much to abandon the Saudis in the middle of an actual ongoing Middle Eastern crisis between Sunni and Shia okay in just a second I Want to talk about\nThe great battle of our time which is not Saudi Arabia versus Iran or even Republican versus Democrat it is President Trump
