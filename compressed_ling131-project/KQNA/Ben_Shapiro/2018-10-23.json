department of the public information officer alongside with Jerry and Rachel Monica you\nI'm a girl born and raised in ... valley went to school down in ... in Tucson for years and then moved to Seattle actually for a couple of years and worked in corporate business\nUm decided to move back home and served my community and been probably serving was prescribe police department ever since\nThe tilt a little bit about what your duty and until you said the aisle and um yeah you know tell us you know Dan life of a community services officer with breast milk police department or every day every day is completely different we have a million things we're working on but our main thing is\nActing as a community liaison or we run a bunch of different events I'm more of the primary background investigators for the department as well\nAnd um do security around the station um\nWork on a multitude of things but I Would say the main things would be on the community events we just had one on Sunday we were at a school on Saturday um we're doing a bunch of things coming up next couple of months in short terms with shop with a cop on the turkey Dr we're going to be involved with and just many things like that\nYeah it's amazing 'cause I'm ... maybe some of you don't know but I Am the official turkey for the press about chamber of commerce so I actually am the one in Turkey outfit for the flying had turkey drive so it's amazing to me that we're already at the end of October\nAnd that is just just literally mere weeks away so I'll be in the turkey outfit so yeah you guys you know or we'll get to see each other again and say hey look but on the other one of the turkey too\nSo I'm of course that's just one of the events coming up in the near future but we also have and we're going to be talking about Halloween a little bit more with my ... year um but Halloween is next Wednesday and uh you know that's the thirty first of October\nAnd\nAlways you know because it's a school night and so forth and any course any time there's Halloween there could be\n... ...\nYou know things going on and so forth so of course that's where the police department steps in and you know you're wanting to educate people about what you guys are gonna be doing for a Halloween so do their yeah so\nWe're doing a couple of things were going to be present at the event center in Prescott valley um is from four to seven PM so we're going to be handing out candy there on the thirty first\nUm and just today we want to talk about basic Halloween safety tips um we've released to a couple of press releases um but we wanted to be here and just talk with you talking about the basic things you know stranger danger um someone invite you into their house or invites the kids\nUm someone invite you into their house or invites the kids into the van always say no walk away and report it\nOn other things that you might not think of like we recommend wearing makeup versus actually wearing a mask just for the visibility I'm always carry close Dexter flashlights are not trip and you're also have this vision of field of view and things like that\n[noise] so um you mentioned some of these press releases are they going to be on the police department's website yes\nSo there'll be on the website there'll be um hopefully published and some of the news outlets and also on the Facebook page\nOkay and then what are the things that uh do you want to talk about with regard to her own safety tips\nYeah like I mentioned um just keeping the lights are very visible especially when you're crossing streets um everyone has a smartphone nowadays are just put that down when you're crossing the street on look both ways kind of the old adage obviously\nI'm trying to use cross rocks if possible and went walking don't walk in the street um in terms of driving we're ... we're asking knew were inexperienced drivers to maybe hold off um and just be extra cautious especially between five thirty PM and nine thirty pm that's going to be the most active hours for the youth\nSo I'm just keep keep your head on a swivel and for the children ... hopefully there'll be an bright colors and they'll have that a flashlight or close to ... will be extra um protection for them and the roads did you want to say something\nWe really encourage or a shorter especially don't try to eat the candy until they get home and have it checked out by their parents while they're going to law or should the parents should be instructing them to that a\nSafety device\nAlways good advice um [noise]\nNow if we've all heard the\nHorrible stories of things in the past that and and end up getting into candy and it's just it's it's sad that we you know you almost ... you just have to inspect the candy before it's you know you give it to your kid because you want to make certain that there is nothing you know without wrong with\nThat we've been listed interested valley not to have any major issues like that but you can't take that for granted no and safety is always the best way to go\nBut uh you you mentioned the um you know Halloween safe trick or treat event at the press about even center\nAnd one of the things of course you know everyone really comes together as a community for that event I'm so there was on business league or Arizona early bird lines club go wrong roar and then um you know the press valley chamber the you know the town\nWe all you know everyone just comes together to provide a safe venue for ah you know any you know ... anybody there really come and um you know what what I said literally tons and tons of candies literally there are tons and tons of candy\nUm and it's all I mean I'll back stuff man stuff that you know you get at the store or anything like that so you know I Would say it's you know it's\nProbably pretty safe uh so uh it's something that if if you have any doubts a you know about trick or treating definitely give a Halloween a safe trick or treat event\nOr a try because that is a great event and it it it's just those ... you'll literally ... tons of candy all just you know I'll just keep on saying that if you're if you're worried about it but to anything else that you guys can think of\nJust reiterating please come and say Hi to us at the event of Prescott valley would like to meet you meet your kids just I'm also I'm coloring book pages for the kids that will re instill the Halloween sexy tips for later the night if you do hit the streets so there'll be always nice for the kids to read and color\nOr the key things I always try to emphasize especially when we're in a community event it's not an us and them it's a we were all on the same side and safety and protection is all of our responsibilities at our children obviously our greatest uh\nA client's if you please keep safe\nAnd then it's amazing because you know ... ... valley as a community that is growing younger and it's amazing to see how many kids just show up at a lot of these events because really there are a lot of kids in this town there and my I mean I have a six year old daughter so yeah I can\nWith ours are Latino a point to event this last Sunday\nThat there were just young people all over the place and most of the more a part of the Latino community which was a part of our target group but uh still when you see them running around having a good time it's just great that you can be in that environment and they feel safe\nAnd then you know one of the things to talk about that that event because\nYou know you work with the fire department on that and we you know we\nKnew we were out there you guys were out there and I I was so grateful that the weather you know there's a lotta yes it ended up being built all day\nAnother country at a local independent insurance agent with auto owners are and someone you can call one bad stuff happened and this moment to get an agent who protect you in that moment hello this is Susan Morrison that age in a chair at house chopping insurance comes here today at four hundred whites borrowed we are what are the only locally owned and operated independent insurance agencies let them get [noise]\nIndependent insurance agencies Latin [noise]\nYou're listening to talk of the town on cake you and I once again here's your guest house mad search or\nHay and we're back to ... valley and now we have the chamber spotlight section of our show and with us in the studio right now is bill ... they are the owners of Wolverine ... excuse me home and property inspections so welcome to the show guys thanks so\nYou know of course you know you probably heard you know I'm a newly minted real estate agent and one of the things that was drilled down to us in the last few months that are\nDoing school and so forth was how important a home inspection is so you know tell tell us why\nYou know why it's important of course I mean I Know the reason why now but I you know of course you out that you know for those who are listening out there why home inspections are important and you know I'm sure you guys are being kept busy with everything going with the market the way it's going and so you know tell us you know about yourself and so far so go for\nA good reason to have a home inspection is when you're buying a home was one of your big us investments are going to ever put into and it we we charge at an average of three hundred and some wearing that money protecting your two hundred thousand dollar home if we'd get in there and we find some big\nIssues and then a will save you a lot of time and money if you if you just have an inspection and we can tell you what's going on the condition of home and everything like that\n[noise] now one of the things that I remember reading is that you can't waive Allman spectrum but would you advise you know\nIf you're spending that kind of money one why not if you buy used car\nYou want to get a mechanic then inspected that's basically what we do inspect their home like would a used car just so you know and especially the big big items your electrical your heating or cooling you know your plumbing and all that the big items as what you really want to get checked out little paint chips on that and we don't care too much about that\nSo one of them I mean you don't have to say where I Want to stress that but what if some of the biggest issues or problems that you guys see I'm a daily basis I'm\nDoing a lot of problems with roofing foundations around this area there's a lot of movement in and settlement and it's either settlement or its foundation issues and you need to know what it is\nAnd and I mean we're talking clock foundations and so forth and because we you know we live in an area that has the greatest soil in the world I'm being facetious and uh so uh you know it's you know which one of the reasons why the\nCounty ended up doing and soils tests so we know who you know how how deep your foundation needs to be so it doesn't settle and so forth so it it that's one of the biggest issue yeah you're saying yeah well it's just what are some of the others oh you're\nGetting your electrical you gotta watch out homeowners I own a home like to play electrician sometimes and safety big safety with you know he met with a carbon monoxide detector smoke detectors or you just go through it all home and just checked for everything safety issues gasoline and make sure they're kept it they're not being used and\nYou know everything that could go wrong would go wrong if you don't get inspected and that way they know when they're buying a home with the what the get fixed before they actually pay for the home\nSo me ask you this in terms of you know an interesting question so we have a lot of newer homes and impressive valley in the area and a lot of them sometimes older homes where do you teach them much more of the problems in their homes are older [noise] I Would just adding\nNew and old inspected because uh they're building a lot of homes now they're really building them fast and they're moving moving moving and some of the stuff might get the\nOverlooked so you just want to make sure you get in there and check it out so\nYeah I've seen the patio and\nOne of the things we see and this would be in more in the east home is there a lot of ... especially in the Prescott area there are a lot of background homes index can become other there are a lot of fun and they're beautiful they need to be maintained the need to know that that that can secure in stable that that everything is\nSpace correctly so that children or pets or anything can't fall through that index or something that are really we're having at the big thing on your inspection people overlook\nThat when they're looking at a house they don't look at the at the structure of the gap or make sure that it's correct and that can be a very dangerous thing so that that's another thing that really good to make sure you in fact in ...\nYou know I was I I always try to do that before I come on the show is do a little research so I went on your website and a bill you have quite a bit of experience in the electrical fields and um you know and of course\nUm you mentioned um you know you have to continue your education just like a real estate agent you have to continue education as a home inspector so tell us a little bit about you know yourself and how you got into this uh I\nI had over Thirty years HVAC service businesses service technician and I was back east for twenty two years and we're joined in union which union always keeps you trained and and they ... electrical you know gas piping heating cooling electrical stuff and\nPlumbing but I'm certified and all them through the union through the courses of training and all that and so when I go into a home it's easy for me to to look and see you know what to look for\n[noise] so if anybody out there wants to get hold of you guys and really like oh my gosh I Need to go home inspection how do they get older you\nKnow our phone number is nine to eight three oh wait for six three zero or you can go on our website this look up ... home inspection a whole inspection property and the where Facebook\nIs basically on line on the Facebook stuff and all that so you can get a hold is look up and threw Ashley they actually have us if you're looking for a home inspector go to the ... and ... are named right there for her right\nWell thank you very much for coming in today and telling us a little bit about what you guys do and why it's so important so we're gonna switch gears here kind of in same same type of thing\nBut we have Mike Myers here he is with he is the owner I should say the owner of lawyers heating and cooling so welcome to the show my only twenty two years now as you're selling them being an anniversary to aren't you getting there yeah\nSo uh tell us about you know what's going on with you well\nRight now I mean when I started I think we need to start talking about getting those furnaces starting up and I tell everybody and everybody says changing filters this Saturday the great morning for you guys all to get in there\nYou know have your cup of coffee changer filtering turn your furnace on don't wait 'til the coldest day of the year to turn your furnace on and find out that you're going to have to call somebody because there's not a service technician in the world that wants to do that\nSo are you saying Mike that's when you get a lot of calls yeah that's when we get a lot of calls\nAnd if you know I'm sure I mean we've already been running here just because you know [laughter]\n'cause it's it's you know a little chilly and you have a family of ...\nUm so but yeah definitely you know we're changing filters um ... you know in terms of some of the other things would be a good time to schedule it you know they think there's an issue with uh their heater is it bad for the call now in waiting instead of waiting till later to give you guys to call\nAll right now get get on the schedule our service to attacks are running like cats on a Hot Tin roof right now we need to keep bill and we need to get you on the schedule I'm good people\nYou're on the schedule I'm good people take time there are only so many in the area that are actually certified\nOr as an aide certified installers ac mechanic same idea our guys are all trained they've been through the schooling they know what to look for their gas professionals they're going to look for leaks and good time to talk about carbon monoxide probably we touched on a little bit with our home inspectors\nCarbon monoxide detector is coming to types high level in lower level detectors you really want to work on the low level detection I mean if you have nine parts per million for eight hours you're going to start feeling effect from that\nYou have detectors that or at home depot right now that alarm at Seventy parts per million so you'll never even know if you have a seal problem we look at detectors that start showing it three an alarm at ten it's a low level carbon monoxide detector and I recommend everybody have one of those in their house\nCheaper insurance for your family safety do you see a lot of problems with criminal acts I ...\nIt's the number one problem that we see with gas appliances and it comes from older homes are not proper combustion air\nUh people not doing things property or maybe we added two or three exhaust fans and the houses building starts getting better and better our houses get tighter and tighter\nAt that point we have to meet her the incoming air and actually make sure that you have enough air it's a coed sixty two point too but we won't get into all that fun stuff we don't have to go there we know what that means and we know your house needs to breed that house cannot be airtight so we want to work on that and make sure that we're not getting a negative pressure\nWhen your stove and comes on and your water heaters trying to flew out and it draws that right back into the house so there's things to look at but easy protection for you as a low level carbon monoxide detector\nAnd you're definitely would you agree you're an advocate for preventive maintenance on even air conditioning or heating ... because you don't want it to get too late and then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ben
