we'll talk about what exactly those holes are one she never mentioned for years that sexual assault\nOne she never mentioned for years that sexual assault never mentioned cabinet now that doesn't necessarily undercut all of our credibility according to force you never said anything until two thousand twelve also she testified in front of the Senate she'd never coach any bad rap members you made a big deal out of taking the polygraph and just a little turtle her notes\nFrom her psychiatrist you turn over a polygraph now or a polygraph notes rate them questions of their own in the polygraph notes the original polygraph notes that before she took the polygraph that she was sexually assaulted in the early eighties you crossed out early\nNobody and then she took the polygraph and then she passed the polygraph but she testified under oath that you did not coach anyone on a polygraph never asked why rent that that's not true here it's her testify under oath\nI didn't expect it to be as long as it was going to be so it's a little bit stressful and you have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who was polygraph test never\nPay and it turned out that that is a serious question for were you lying about that and then they'll send a letter to the attorneys for this woman for Christine Blasey Ford and he asked for material evidence relevant the allegation and then you want some he says he wants to know from the therapy sessions the doctor for just us\nAnd it turned over to the Washington Post\nAnd he says he wants copies of all video or audio recordings produce during the course of the polygraph examination of Dr Portland she will not turn over\nAnd then he says the full details and Dr ... polygraph are particularly important because of the Senate Judiciary committee sworn statement from a long time ... stating that he personally witnessed soccer for coaching a friend on polygraph examination when asked under oath and the hearing any tips or advice and someone who was planning on taking a polygraph soccer for replied never\nMisstatement raising concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination therefore need that information so she's got a credibility problem there as well then she also has another credibility problem\nIt turns out that she had in her Senate testimony that she was in therapy in two thousand twelve because you had a fight with her husband about building a second front door and the reason that she wanted a second front door\nIs because she had security could still deeply disturbed about her alleged sexual assault at the hands of Brett Kavanaugh\nWill now it turns out that that's a really nice story\nReal clear in fact we have a real they're investigating has a piece\nIn which he does real estate and other records on her cut a key part of Christine Blasey Ford's account of why she finally came forward with charges of a temporary Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after some Thirty years four testified last week and she had never revealed the details of the alleged attack until twenty twelve when she was in therapy with the memory percolated up they revisited a disagreement they'd had\nOver her insistence on selling a second front door when they remodeled their Palo Alto California home and he took them to understand pushed her to Beijing one and the door to alleviate symptoms and fought for phobia and panic attacks based on the alleged assault\nShe finds time Feinstein out is that the reason for the second front door it's walking a phobia and for that correct\nBut documents reveal the door was installed years before as part of an ... and you buy rent or\nAnd even a marriage counseling at the door with not Netscape route but an entrance for an attorney familiar with the ongoing

therapy concerned about her real estate transactions fire relationship before being reported that I don't want to mention it personal\nSince the second friends from local colleges have lived any additional room with the private door so in other words there are a lot of holes in her story\nOh which suggest that maybe there are some serious questions that need to be born to count and this week it seems more questions have been raised about that account that have actually been raised about Brett Kavanaugh coming off the president of the United states could not hold himself that you know\nThe

dressed and no drinking Han consequently my initial thought was that you might be a high end call girl because of the time they weigh three hundred and fifty pounds\nThat you might be a high end call girl because of the time I weigh three hundred and fifty pounds so it was someone like her want with me there was no conversation about a changing sets for money so I decided to talk with her I'd never been hit on and if I didn't leave with her that night although we talked about getting together\nOver the next couple of weeks we met when I Believe and still believe in the Jewish place from the beginning Julie knew I was married in that I was having marital issues\nAnd says she was an opportunity I felt she had only interest in my three hundred fifty pounds out because I was on TV\nAnd well known although we're not emotionally involved with physical contact we never had sex despite the fact was very sick with me and then he talks about all of her fantasies you know sets of multiple guys and he'd suggests that or she is politically motivated and he says\nThat basically she's not going to believe you basically calls her sociopath a and so that's that's not great for her account either enter account always was was really troublesome right that the gang rape account was always\nA very difficult to get in shape considering there should have been witnesses for any of that stuff and they get to a final allegation of Democrats tried to bring up last minute and just one second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you said why would you

now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off at healing Shapiro that's hugely dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress order healing sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nInto the final allegation those brought by Democrats all the allegations are falling apart the final allegation those brought against Brett Kavanaugh was brought last minute by Senator Chris Coons so here is the accusation apparently Chris going forward and ... years in New haven\nThe accuser who apparently created TV show in which people strip well dancing to their favorite music\nWhich is an awesome TV show probably tell them a party that took place at the house of judge Kavanaugh was undergrad fraternity during the Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen eighty eight schoolyard which allegedly featured some salacious activity of court judge Kavanaugh had already graduated when this is only the first year law student that period it as you well know most academically in time and most students live\nA delegation has all the makings of a tabloid headlines but there's just one problem we admit to having no evidence whatsoever that judge Kavanaugh even attended his party\nIs Chuck Grassley slapping the crap out of Chris Coons\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence and then the accuser provide some investigative evidence he proposes that someone searched judge Kavanaugh's calendars very them calendar is your college have dismissed and derided\nTo determine gunpoint in Nineteen eighty seven in Nineteen eighty eight and that's it all he alleges that he wants witness that's all ages party at our house owned by judge Kavanaugh as an undergrad fraternity even kind of pain and search judge Kavanaugh calendars to determine if he attended we've reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation\nThere is no evidence the judge Kavanaugh was anywhere near the party or the ... the only person we can be sure attended the party\nWas the accuser investigators have serious work to do all the minority has refused to engage with the allegations against judge Kavanaugh in any meaningful way by investigators have tried to pursue every relevant lead and therefore I Hope that before boarding an allegation and the future he'll first consider whether you'd want you on your staff has been valuable time investigating it\nThanks for your consideration [laughter] honestly I I got to love Chuck Grassley the dude just does not give any at it this way he'd be like you know what we're done we're just done here we are finished it ... it it it's just great because he doesn't seem to Bernie Sanders earlier this week burning standard sent him a letter saying\nWe wind up longer FBI investigation and Grassley sent him a letter back saying Bernie you came out five minutes after the nomination and said that you were going to oppose Gavin you think all I can change your mind you're gonna change your mind maybe we'll talk about it\nIs it just it's amazing so all of that leads up to the fact that there's just a shifting argument going on in this started off if you recall with an argument that Brett Kavanaugh was unfit for the court because he allegedly tried to rape of growing and Seventeen\nBut that was the original allegations then it turned into gang rape that turned out to people and it turned into excellent himself at a party no evidence of that and it turned into okay well maybe it's because he got angry residents angry we kind of angry people on the court because Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems like at the white\nA roommate or Ginsberg who goes out and rent an RPG than it tore his RPG yeah they should go down and she ran politically every five minutes she's perfectly she's perfectly well balanced me on the corporate Brett Kavanaugh got mad when you accused him of being a gang rape it\nDoesn't belong on the court the shifting ballpark posts are just insane here's Hillary Clinton thank\nBrett Kavanaugh's haters out of bounds well I mean Hillary you want to be president and you drank John McCain under a table and through a lamp that your husband serves that\nHey here's Hillary Clinton wearing again something that she got from Mugabe's wardrobe in in ...\nBut I think for anyone who believes there is such a thing as a judicial temperament and that we want judges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about\nYeah because he got mad when you use them of of being ... and I remember\nSomeone else getting mad when when her husband was accused of rape I remember that who that have been accused of sexual assault\nThat was probably true I remember somebody getting mad about that oh yeah and she wanted to be president in the United states by the way I should correct magill in reference has moved ... not ... it was a dictator and Bob way we've got to we've got to his character from doing okay how how else did the shift that the standards so Alison camera on CNN\nThere was a story about how Brett Kavanaugh back when he was in college got in a bar fight with a guy who was from ice at a guy\nOr now let me explain how this works I went to Harvard law school a lot of great minds there why are these folks will be senators the people who are in my class and there was a group of guys who go out they invited me but I'd just as you'll hear this is not they would go out to bars they'll get drunk off their body and then they were just sock each other in the nuts\nI not not a joke like they would actually just punch each other and the growing like this is an actual thing that I Would hear about later\nImagine not my kind of party but the accusation here by alpha camera that ice throwers are more likely to assault so if you're in a bar fight with due to a bar\nThen it must be they use sexually assaulted a woman years prior\nMakes perfect sense\nMakes perfect sense I'm with you all the way Allison get yours Alison camera out of making a fool of herself\nI think that if you are known as a belligerent main fighting drunks that's relevant I think that it's relevant to than a woman who says that you would corner her and put your hand over her mouth somehow\nThat I think makes more sense than if you were just a fun drunk who always felt right asleep\nOkay or alternatively the two things don't necessarily have to do with one another because guys getting bar fights with other dude and then they may not touch women\nBecause that happens actually affair but that's where it's like these people have never met a man it's it's an incredible incredible thing coming up more goalpost shifting from the Democrats Senator Bernie Sanders has a new way of shifting the goalposts really irritating because let's face it the original allegations those were serious rents are allegations\nPlus face it the original allegations those were serious I'm Sorry allegations that having a drink and they have and I was mad when he was in college sometimes when he was wrong\nOr that the FBI have not we'll talk about all of a sudden\nAdmitted you probably want to eat healthy\nBut getting enough organic fruits and vegetables in your diet every day is not only time consuming and
