could do that over time just doing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nSignificant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members of medicine here and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save\nWhere all you and you and your mates all you know you you

reprehensible international crisis but make no mistake is absolutely organized these things don't spontaneously happen it's impossible\nAnd if you if you go to your favorites search engine and type in Honduran caravan organizers they'll give you the list of several names couple of them just got arrested in Guatemala the Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back to Honduras\nBut there's still people organizing this of course that have you noticed that the all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks weird\nIsn't that odd the brand new backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop us\n[noise] and if you listen to most of our elected officials that's what their rights we can't stop them\nWhat are we gonna do\nYou know the\nDemocrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill\nDon't hesitate to criticize President Trump for his policy of securing our border enforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting criminals who break our immigration laws deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats to\nAn Republicans\nUntil they figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively\nFor being an engine nationalist for being all about open borders for being compassionate\nUh you know what's compassionate\nCompassionate does not enabling people to continue\nTo follow the same broken destructive patterns that they have a year after year after decade after decade you know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change\nThe Honduran government or the Mexican government you're terrified for your life in Honduras I'd get it gets what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change\nBut they will remember when we all love the Arab Spring where we had people rise up against their governments across the middle east because they were set up and they were done how is it time maybe for a Central American spring why as the default obligation for America\nAnd for the mainstream media to be all things are awful in these countries come in we capture back\nWhy is that suddenly the definition of compassion why is that suddenly the definition of being a real American oh if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really a polling American ideals are values\nAre you kidding me since when and how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them India think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't they keep\nComing why because we left that men\nAnd said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat\nSenator Ben carton ah he is the senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led lesson 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\nFought on one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supportive bipartisan Democrats or Republicans if the President Trump's budget oh we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nThey hear that and he goes on on this and then think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the a higher level of statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable ... old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already\nAnd somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\nWe're bribing them we're bribing the government's down there\nTo get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter on during that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country\nAnd they're angry at us\nFor saying no they can't come in\nBut think about that for a minute you are an elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who elected you are fleeing your country\nTo go elsewhere\nAnd your responses not gene maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my an apt to corrupt government to come into your country\n... these countries spend more time focusing on our policies then\nTime focusing on our policies then fixing now and then you've got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables at who enabled vet by throwing more money at it so I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today\nAnd if you want you can get the whole interview over at my radio station to be a male dot com but I came back around and I said All right listen I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\nBut I don't agree with you on on that statement I I I've been embedded with the FBI down to Central America I Know how dangerous the birds are\nBy the way I real fast and they just did it the ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with the than we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nI find you you you were you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years that came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children really they all have tattoos ... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states to set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I understand the danger factor as it relates to these gang activities\nI think most of the families that show up at our border or people who see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America in some cases they have a legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do\nWell if they have a legitimate claim for asylum claim should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper ...\nHold on I'm Sorry to stop you but wanting a better economic situation and being afraid of a criminal element in your home country are not legitimate claim\nThat are very few I don't agree with you one\nAnd then I'm In a positive for a minute 'cause that's terribly important because the Democrats and open border Republicans are doing this all the time\nThey say well you know these people are just seeking asylum in our country they're looking for a better life and we need to be compassionate we need to follow international political for asylum\nIs seeking a better economic life is not a legitimate claim asylum but living in a crime infested country is not a legitimate claim for asylum otherwise my friends in Chicago would be claiming asylum in Toronto right now\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM change you in a protected rally Ninety nine point nine M.

you get the opportunity to do what the comprehensive\nImmigration means we're gonna throw all of this garbage into one giant bill that everyone has to vote on\nAnd it'll include border protection and

say well\nWhy why why does all of that other stuff\n... why does that need to be part of this solution this is a very cut and dry standalone problem there are people from another country\nWho are crossing our border illegally and demanding to stay here it has nothing to do with path to citizenship for people who are already here it has nothing to do with visas it has nothing to do with

chair as well and I've known since I first they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue was\nTo Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the ... and\nAh all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story as well ah I recently this week got to interview Carter Page not Carter Page of the central figure of the uh Spygate scandal right\nAh and and the the he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit\nAgainst the Democratic National Committee\nAnd against a Perkins ... which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party ... and especially I implore you read Donald Brazil's book is called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happened her experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz was a mess it was completely math and she she tells a lot of truth in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally\nAnd to the DNC\nHow the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in and they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the DNC hired a farm through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know slime Carter Page uh that really means they Hillary Clinton campaign\nBecause they call the shots so not Carter Page this week prior to death filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DNC and against a ... now why did he go after those people will be I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly [laughter] that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those two entities there wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a ... to warrant\nA petition for and to prove to the FBI petition for by the FBI unapproved through five six words for them to survey all him\nTo look into every little or if his of his electronic footprint via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this are incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants that that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency to spy on an American citizen the only way they can do it through advice or worn and they're supposed to be a very high bar\nTo get a five to warrant\nAnd to get this vice who weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA the claims Carter Page was and they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the ... weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government it's right there and black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty six date on behalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained under oath to the court\nTo Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week\nSuing the DNC and ... with this law firm for defamation and I think about this from it Carter Page is either an agent of the Russian government and basically\nParticipated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he has an innocent American citizen who has been slime than slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration\nHe's got to be one of the other bright ... there's no in between here there is no if and we're certainly no but I mean if there was a button hero it'd be a car Daschle and proportions\nCarter Page is either it's dual or a a sorry a stew age of the prudent crumbling or he is completely innocent\nAnd and you know I don't know if you know a lot about quarter pays like I say it hasn't done a lot of a media he's a Naval Academy graduate he was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes\n[noise] he was in intelligence in the navy\nAnd in in an officer in the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get into military intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer [noise]\nUm and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his a Naval Academy education\nHe then went into private business and did went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he's about ever noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but one of the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate\nAnd he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you want but understand most of his dealings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had a reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a rock Obama was promising his counterpart there that he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this uh this Mitt Romney guy in won reelection\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he still thinks it's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think the government is as bad as everyone says that's what that's not a legal\nHe he can do that in fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak\nNo sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we ... we still do business with Moscow\nYou may disagree but guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make them a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here\nCarter Page could very well be in Asian or the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning\nThe brain that the good lord gave you as you evaluate the story that is presented to you\nThat the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page who was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and polite and reporting to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one to this day no one\nHas charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch\nNot Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein no\nOne at the federal level no one at the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years\nThey've got everything on him\nNo charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page\nAnd you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit new trees in effect\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and the vitamin ... Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen it if that were true\nWhy would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation lawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect is that the DNC\nCan defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit with one very simple strategy it's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they've got to do is proof\nThat Carter Page\nIs in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court and well funded and you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense a well funded investigation into you\nIf you truly are an agent of the Russian government\nWhy would you do that would you do that\nAnd I again I I he could be an agent of the Russian government Carter Page and James Comey and Peter Struck in Andrew McCabe when we're ready to Lynch and and the whole team over there\nDuring the Obama administration who ordered this investigation this unprecedented spying on an American citizen who was connected with the presidential campaign during a presidential election and then only so much of it leaked to the press shocking how much of it got leaked to the ... they could all be true\nWe're there to talk of the ... eleven thirty AM cage you in a press your belly and on Ninety nine point nine F.

you an example how crazy it is this is the executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party forced to resign because he posted on social media\nStand for the flag I Neal for the cross I'm not making this up or Salvadoran that's the hard way solace wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the ...\nOur way cells wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also military veteran you'd think he'd be allowed to stick up for America once in a while but now he made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post quote I stand for the flag and yell at the cross\nNo not so long ago most Democrats would've nodded in agreement that today it's speech and he lost his job but tonight their losses are gaining marks outlets joins us now\nMark thanks for coming on the show a mistake that I mean did you have to leave your job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that I stand for the flag I knew what the cross loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which are remind you was over a year ago that I listed that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a new\nShow I I look I'm confused I'm I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time know a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and Neal before the cross what is it been five even\nRemember this is the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform remember that there was like oh a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive director of the executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if you're if you're a former coworker said to you since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that it was a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from many of them\nThat's not shocking what does this say to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays\nUm there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately if my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive\nUh but I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered a racist than what happens to the country do you think going forward\n[noise] that's that's a good question I'm a little worried about that\nWell I'd like to continue to bring this to light and continue to voice concern for this very issue um and then in the short term um ironically my son is going in the air force and sixty days so I'm going to spend some time with him and then I Will continue to fight this cause as long as I can continue to clear my name\nGod Bless and let let me just say again I'm not a supporter of the Democratic party but I Hope you stay in that party 'cause I think it needs to normal people thank you I Hope you remain mark thanks very much for sharing that the shocking\nStory
