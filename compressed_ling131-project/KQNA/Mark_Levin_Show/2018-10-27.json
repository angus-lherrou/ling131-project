now Bloomberg coming in and doing two million because they saw what we saw in our polling which has the races tied very close\nAnd they kept saying they thought they had it all put away but I'll tell you where we are in here we're fighting because if we can get this great record that we have of you know growing the economy is getting more people back to work um you know passing the opioid legislation that the president signed this week at the White House\nThat I was there with Democrats and Republicans celebrating that we got this national emergency in the opioid crisis six billion dollars that were doing to help and the press and didn't want to talk about that so I appreciate you being a place where we talk about issues and the good things\nThat we're getting done for the country and my opponent opposes this agenda and just wants to resist were about result they're about resistance about you know getting things\nThere that improve the quality of life in advance our economy protect you know our citizens public safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed\nBy and supported by the federal employees pack as well as every business group involved so I brought together a diverse coalition\nWhat what kind of group so back to your opponent\n[noise] um well the uh the metro union group that as a running an attack\nOut I keep threatening to shut down the um the metro in the Washington DC area and violate yeah can violate the law\nAnd they're attacking me for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like that that's what this is a union that was so you know that's functional that the Obama administration support it suited and that to supporting her and and other union groups but she hasn't gotten\nYou know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put\nHer own staff into fake parties city costumes as police in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record on\nPublic safety are let me ask you for ... let me ask you this before we run out of time roads it's a big deal in northern Virginia [noise] on there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program which is a heavy duty tax or on the toll road is\nYeah it was the was for that that there is forty six dollar to all the same when you're ... you're going to Washington she was for them before she was against them\nAnd you know she was on the committee that you know that they put the put through that but more importantly to see things against them yet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place\nHow she was ineffective in persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president\nAnd you know the administration initially it was going to do a pay freeze\nAnd I went to them politely and made my case and talked about why it was important that people who you know like the FBI the CIA all this you know that they got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and\nYou know arresting a character that they got today and so um I work politely with the administration on that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything um and and get rid of those forty six dollar calls and so we need somebody who is affected who can work with\nYou know a Republican administration or a Democrat I've demonstrated that and and I've always been\nSomeone advocating lower taxes Terry and public safety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police and\nI'd be well you are in a tough district some marginal districts\nIn what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia\nA particularly the federal workers and others\nAnd the teachers are the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out and what they've done and the Democratic party is they have selected the most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could\nAnd they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important\nLet me speak to the little then I sat there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially important that you come out and vote up and down the ticket and you come out and vote for Barbara Comstock\nUm she may not be as conservative as you like put

Monday and this hour I'd be remiss if I didn't start out talking about the recent\nSpate of bombs or at least a would be bombs I guess and the arrest of a suspect I I don't\nEven want to say his name because often these people like the fame\nOr infamy for that matter that they acquire by these dastardly acts the suspect but we did have previous arrests and was known to the authorities but we can't prevent every crime or a threat in this country I'm Amazed that we prevent as many as we do and and you know figure out who's up to what\nBut one has to be impressed with a quick action of the authorities to find the suspect\nIt never ceases to amaze me how professional an excellent our law enforcement people are they are truly amazing\nAnd and in fact one of the things I've set for all the years that you know the top brass it's not that effective bought the day in and day out people would do the job are terrific\nAnd it was good to see by the way the FBI Director make a statement about the effectiveness of his team and others who helped out actually I don't want you but I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI is ten most wanted list you know never hear from them you know if it's like he doesn't exist\nI've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those who knows department who abused their authority and they clearly did\nAnd

lax\nBefore his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the president goes all the issues and people you know with the Mueller investigation and everything else that's going on and his next attorney general wouldn't be approved right now with you know what do you want another uh Kavanaugh hearing to take place this is not the time\nBut he's never lived up to the expectations

show\nMark I'm feeling it for Larry Elder of the pain free relief factor dot com studios and as I said what they call that eight eight eight to nine seven one saying what you're calling about the\nYour reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to meet somebody on the left trying to blame president from for what this crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President Trump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's falls and everything\nRight like our economy is because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just that person will pop up he he mentions it all the time all critical to me that's because of what I started okay which by the way explains why they were so against now justice Kevin in wouldn't have mattered if the president had nominated a left is like the pope\nWhatever the president's for their against remember they were getting whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they have their son's ready that is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters pay hazing and they hate him with a passion\nAnd you know I thought that we reached the edge of the top with George W. Bush and their hatred\nThis one is being surpass this bumbling fool could never had beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledged the great things that he has done so these acts\nWill not long be about this evil did you notice shuts like it was long about basically Ford that didn't last it wasn't about her it was about the Democrats regaining power\nSo she she's like an asterisk now that's what she's going to probably be an industry\nSo it'll just be always about punishing President Trump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it which is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think is a set of eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven one stage\nIt has also been amazing to see the Democrats in the meeting in action you know the Democrats than going to use these acts to the parties in a vantage bought for their media to be so blatant in their advocacy\nIs all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial to their views for many years now a lot of us know that that's not a secret\nBut they use to pretend here's the difference that they were not by no more now does out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see them their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that in his questions\nThey're out to get the president and make no mistake about it\nAnd the media has enormous power to influence of the debate and our elections and the person is right to call them out on this show the president has rightly called up a press for who they are\nAnd the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation and just today I was watching getting ready for the show they always Shepard Smith on Fox\nSaying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that AIG is that people like the suspect on so Mary was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right blamed people with bad values\nWere bad acts not those who share their political views but of course that we're on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his\nSupport or remember who shot the seriously injured Congressman Steve skull east\nAnd the other cars when he would have wiped them out if he could what President Trump is responsible no matter what he says even when he tries to unify us he's no good CNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching each at all I I live in another planet\nAnd there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump is right and a lot of supporters are people argue with me when I've done other shows\nLike I said how could you say you know because it was my position if Hillary and bill will agree never to bother us again\nAnd leave the scene which is I Know is impossible it's not going to happen then I might agree not to indict or if I had any power to say that oh you could imagine a cold I got mark how could you be above the law and they had a great point that it's not inciting people to write\nThey had a great point that it's not inciting people to write or to physically harm someone that is a legitimate political ...\nBut it's asked me to see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that is unacceptable\n[noise] so they're almost all on the left and we're fortunate to have someone like President Trump called them out we've had so many we presidents in the past and it's absolutely refreshing to see someone take it back to their\nEven if the media the left the Democrats can't take President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country\nTell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven one stage and let's try to get a caller to in Houston, Texas let's go to Mark Mark you're on with mark high margin\nHigh marks a the mark or what you were bringing up about a media is absolutely true\nThey want to record the fact that the the cycle and here's a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida light power and I I don't know some other threats to sow what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the the ... the ... first of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that\nYou know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them operate the worst you said a few times during his is a a a\nNod to his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times that oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that was that but he hasn't done anything like that where the the left whether it's the actual political people or the the news\nUh they've all actually said that are going out and confront them and and and and and run 'em out of the stores all this other stuff so I'm again that that are the contrast in different\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face wherever you see them you know don't let them leaving especially if you know they're in the cabinet\n... this is what they do when they do it so K. Mart don't you get that\nOh of course it's the the ultimate double standard that everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize it but they're not going to say it and even most of the hard core I Would say\nYou know a intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic that are reacting to something there that way if the Trump arrangements that now they could argue that that's the cause of it now too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it does you know that's what they would say no question about it\nBreaking ATF news just recently in the U.S department of education announced that\nActing on a complaint filed by alliance defending freedom
