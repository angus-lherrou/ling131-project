where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president\nAnd you know the administration initially it was going to do a pay freeze and I went to them politely and made my case and talked about why it was important that the people who you know the FBI the CIA or this or that they got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and\nYou know arresting vis a character that they got today and so um I work politely were the administration on that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything um and and get rid of those forty six dollar tolls and so we need somebody who's affective who can work with\nYou know a Republican administration or a Democrat I've demonstrated that and and I've
