for their entire lives called Medicare for all the Democratic proposal what his dad was a government run single payer health care system\nFederal emanates all private employer based health care plan

coming to your neighborhood and and killing ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses\nAnd then they were putting a bunch of people on minimum wage right\nA pause at Walmart\nThere from uh from\nRepublican place aren't they yeah they do is be\nSo I mean for all those reasons I mean Wal Mart was just painful\nBut here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com they happen to be greater than ... the size of Wal Mart yes\nYes the Amazon is three hundred percent\nThese eyes and market capitalization of Walmart is by the left\nBut again you know I don't begrudge them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap\nBut anyway I digress where Amazon goes to fit and then you hear the the post go\nEverybody should take Amazon model now I Will point out some of the obvious here for people to understand that get on the other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a little more to business that are getting crushed by Amazon study ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon ice scale and an ability to deliver the way they're delivering\nA ... they are killing the profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up dead and dying as we speak now\nThan not withstanding\nNumber of people that actually earn minimum wage I went back and actually check my ... and\nEnough the last time it was a really big issue\nIt got to like coming off the occupied crowd\nIn the twenty fourteen mid term elections I happen to be about that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what all the folks in the country had a point because they did kind of thought\nYou know four years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth\nWe never even got close to an average US Economy\nSo yeah okay but\nWhat percentage of people on\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head\nBack in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage\nOne point eight percent even in Iraq Obama's the God ... one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two an avid it'd be working part time\nPeople that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage\nAnd when I got three and a generation we got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people and how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nCording to the bureau of Labor Statistics ... percent\nPoint six percent that zero\nZero point six percent\nNow what's more than ... nine percent of those people\nBe point six percent\nAre under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as I use those wages we got the minimum wage conversation come up again\nAh one of the great fraud perpetuated the doubt they're still living wage happen a good economy\nEconomics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of

the biggest beneficiary\nBut you know\nI I guess conveniently bad ... message has just been missed I Am sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story\nInteresting how even NBC with other news outlets hasn't decided actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just over saying\nAll right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nOr are we doing all good [noise] well\nI see it as kind of a two car problem really I mean you get a single payer health care system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospital in with the smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it out because they can't cut the costs that the government wants to cut them down to her a lot of this stuff\nThat's the first part I see\nThe second part I see as we need to adjust something in the hospitals do you know what it costs to manufacture up one thousand feet of the bag of fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital\nAnd a lot more memory hundred dollars\nWell and and so Ross and I appreciate the call and you have a and a good point by the a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about\nInsurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability and healthcare is health insurance\nProblem is we had been raised the idea that health insurance equal healthcare that's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare\nHas been the lack of people that could afford health care with health insurance according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interest\nBut here's what they found in their research\nThere are forty two million Americans foreign two million have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars\nNow if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only the average cost\nOf health insurance right now so would you be better off\nEighty five hundred dollars you could use on health care\nOr when you'd be better off if eighty five hundred dollars went for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you would hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plans which then you can't hit which is why people can't afford health care that's all part of the financial fraud\nThe number one way to get to more affordable healthcare is to break the back\nOf the insurance first model having embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nYou are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most bad crap crazy thing I've ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical ...\nBeing handed a piece of paper\nThat says in so many words about what ever happened in that facility\nWould you have no clue and generally yet what that's going to be\nIn whatever it happens to cost\nWhich generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for\nWhich they also can't tell you\nYou will Magid walking into a store\nBuilding a car with stuff\nNot having a clue what any of it costs\nAnd signing the piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this\nCrazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to a way the way we use insurance for everything else in her life how is that well\nWhat do we do if we have a mechanical problem with our car\nWhile we we do pay and habits and asked\nIf we get in a big time accident Wi Fi on insurance claims\nWere already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans\nI Can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nSo why don't we go to that point to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and that the Democrats are are sitting there you know day and the worst thing\nThat's essentially what they are as catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nAt that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop\nOh we got to find the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else that is both sat there and we'll take a look at best deal boom done\nWell with health care we never have a shot\nWe never have a shot at doing it one of the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look anytime we have research that will show the costs of a procedure from one place to the next\nUm I had a I had a minor surgery years ago\nI gone through my insurance\nWould have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars\nWe never know because we sign pieces of paper those ads something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your dog\nThere's nothing you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIt's an insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans\nWill continue the conversation coming up next I'm by mud and for the great one\nHim no\nAsk any a

them prioritized um score STO and um for education dollars so I I'd like to look at that a little bit and see where we can reach some common ground I work across the aisle hopefully I'm\nAnd get things done and I often say people hear about the the few things that are very divisive but we do manage to get a lot of things done and all of the bills that you talked about um\nThat I was able to sponsor and pass they were bipartisan bill\n... almost unanimous on both sides of the aisle so and some of them more unanimous so um I I think that I built a reputation of being able to be a problem solver and work across the aisle is find areas of common ground while we can go there I thought I saw it and I look forward to doing that and I hope to do that with you there\nAnd you certainly will

that is the largest percentage increase Thirteen point six percent that is the largest percentage increase\nOf any other state in the country over that time any other state that didn't raise taxes and

rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President Xi but I said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been in effect what people do and say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's at twenty five percent\nSo we're taking and billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China where they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it\nSo China has been look China's the biggest of them all by far it's probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost\nOver the last few years an average of eight hundred billion dollars a year on trade we lose with everybody those days are over\nBill how Leslie wherever the midterms coming up one of my favorite movies is Jimmy Stewart and it's a wonderful life\nI look at Bedford Falls below sea takes the house Schumer Texas Senate

well on the Senate and a lot of things have happened since justice now justice Kavanaugh fifteenth jobs that are actually got fifty new judge many many judges\nAnd we're going to have a hundred and forty five judges fairly so when you think about it I mean a hundred and forty five but it'll be close to fifty percent of the whole judiciary not only to Supreme Court justices so\nBut that was a very big thing happened over the last couple of weeks with just as Kevin are because\nI've rarely seen a person treated so badly the man of great distinction a great life and the way they treated him was horrible and since that happened Republicans are looking so is everybody they see what's going\nOn under the law unintended consequences because I've had many women were spurred my air you know
