daily wire Byron band blur number one federal state local governments keep data involving illegal immigration and crime\nOut of the public purview Fox\nNews reported in twenty Fifteen that a source from immigration and Customs Enforcement types and I love ice I've said that quote that comprehensive statistics on illegal immigrants crime are not available from the federal government\nThat suggested contacting county state and federal jail and prison systems individually to compose a tally a process that would encompass thousands of local government so in other words\nIt's the official position\nOf the federal government not to provide you with the crime statistics\nNot to track it\nThey track everything\nExcept that number two available evidence suggests that illegals are in fact more likely to commit crimes and the rest of the population\nFox News sorted through mirrored local state and federal statistics and found that illegal immigrants are three times as likely to be convicted of murder as members of the general population and account for far more crimes than their three point five percent sure the u._s. population would suggest now why isn't this information\nReported today\nOn good morning America on the today show by ...\nBy ... ... lecture\nThe percentage of illegals committing the number of crimes are as follows according to Fox Thirteen point six percent of those sentence for all committed crimes of the country ... percent of murders sentences sixty percent of trafficking sentence number three this is a deli wire\nAlmost fifty percent of federal crimes are committed near the Mexico border\nA report\nFrom the department of justice in twenty fourteen found the following via judicial watch\nAnd it gives the specific statistics\nNumber for illegal immigrants account for nearly Seventy five percent of federal drug sentences and twenty four again this is according to the United states sentencing commission which also found that illegals were involved in nearly Seventy percent of drug trafficking sensors and over thirty three percent of federal sentences overall\nMark how do you know these people are committing crimes while I don't know about specific individuals but these are the statistics\nI thought big government leftist watch the testers number five a\nDisproportionate amount of illegals are in state prisons Peter cursor now in remember the U.S commission on civil rights lawyer\nReviewed statistics from the government Accountability Office ... Research Center and compared the number of illegals and not illegal in prison for murder related offenses any twenty Fifteen National Review piece some of the findings\nThey're almost Seventy thousand illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand illegals in Arizona\nLet me correct that there were sixty eight point five seven\nAre illegal aliens in prison for every one hundred thousand a legal to an Arizona compared to fifty four point oh six citizens and\nLegal non citizens and it goes on but you can imagine what the statistics are\nPersonal knowledge that while comparing murder incarceration rates isn't a perfect measurement it's difficult to contend that illegal aliens or more are law abiding that legal residence at least when it comes to a major crimes\nBut the more disturbing fact was the approximately two thousand four hundred and thirty illegal aliens who are in prison just for homicide related offenses in California alone\nNumber six tens of thousands of criminal illegals have been released by ice and our large in the country\nIn twenty Fifteen ice released almost twenty thousand illegals that committed sixty four thousand crimes that involved over twelve thousand drunken driving convictions Seventeen hundred and twenty eight cases of assault two hundred and\nSixteen kidnappings and more than two hundred homicide or manslaughter convictions\nAnd this is why when you have a fool like the mayor of Tallahassee Gillum who says that they will not turn over\nConvicted incarcerated and then fried\nIllegal aliens to be deported by ice they will not turn them over to I Do understand that Florida\nYou understand what I'm Talking about [noise]\nWho wants to be your governor I've got more when I returned\nAnd not to mention the shedding I went back in the car that three times a week credited with scratching all night long bouncing on the side of the keeping me awake all night from all the stretching and chewing kind of makes you never\nDoes your dog it scratch tinker shed like crazy\nMounds and mounds of her all over the place come to a dynamite for help\nIn L.

sanctuary cities have hampered law enforcement and cracking down on gangs\nThe great Heather Mac Donald documented the frustrations of Los Angeles law enforcement officers all the way back in two thousand for when they couldn't touch known gang members because of their status has illegals\nWe can't even talk about it says are frustrated LAPD captain people are afraid of a backlash from Hispanics and other LAPD commander in a predominantly Hispanic gang infested district size I Would get a firestorm of criticism if I talked about enforcing the immigration law against illegals\nThe issue is that these gang members\nTended to sneak back into the country even after they were deported for heinous crimes and police officers couldn't enforce immigration laws against them would have to resort to surveilling these gang members until they committed a crime\nNumber nine\nClimate is also increase among major cities that are immigration hubs\nDeli wire editor in chief Ben Shapiro's written quote David from the Atlantic\nNo hard core to immigration opponent and a kind of a cook but anyway wrote in twenty Fifteen\nThat as a twenty eleven there were twenty five thousand illegal immigrants serving murder sentences and nearly three million offenses committed by illegal immigrants between two thousand three and two thousand nine including Seventy thousand sex crimes and hundreds of thousands of other violent crimes\nAfter years of welcome declined from pointed out crime rates are rising in immigration hubs including Houston\n... walkie Phoenix San Diego you got that Gloria border you idiot\nAnd New York it was thirty four percent Arizona seventeenth birthday present during those years criminal aliens accounted for thirty eight percent of all murder convictions and the five states have California Texas\nArizona Florida and New York well illegal aliens constituted only five point six percent of the total population in those states now there's no denying the fact\n\nYou've got a guy running for governor Gillum in Florida that does not a problem with this\n\nWas a criminal illegal alien his release from prison rather than having a detain her do hold on for the feds to deport them ... says abolish ice and no we're not gonna work to get a painter now think about that Florida\n[noise] think about that ladies and gentlemen this is the official position of

work with ice\nThey've smeared ice\nIce isn't even the border patrol ice protects the interior of the United states\nFrom a legal and criminal immigrants and you're supposed to hate them\nNow you know actual facts if you're watching cable TV news parts of cable TV so called you didn't hear any of this instead all your herd all day today and yesterday were trashing Trump\nThat's what you've heard\nYou've heard reportage yell at the ... do you know for sure there are terrorists among the seven thousand what kind of a stupid question is that\nMy response to the reporter is do you know that every one of the seven thousand haven't committed crimes that none of them are terrorists the whole point is there a legal allies are not going through the vetting process well the president said they're criminals among them they're terrorists among them well I have no doubt they're all\n\nCriminals know what they're doing terrorists know what they're doing what we have to wait for them to do something\nBut that's not even the point\nThey're not allowed in our country as a matter of federal law\nThe media do not have the same compassion for American citizens who violate federal law\nThey don't have that same passion for American citizens who may get their taxes wrong or maybe violate Obamacare and so forth and so on\nWhat's happened in this country is the Democratic party in the media have romanticized illegal immigration they romanticized illegal aliens match the propaganda that's going on in this country\nThat the illegal immigrant is noble or better more hard working then the American citizen and these fools on the Democratic party and some of the Republican Party but let's be honest really the Democrat Party is a near monopoly on this little legal immigration\nThese fools in the Democratic party these fools in the media these fools and highly\nWhat they're doing to this country\nIt's unparalleled it's unparalleled\n\nWho have a president who calls it like it is we have a president who is trying to address his hands are tied by ridiculous laws his hands are tied by the Democratic party\nThe media tried to beat him down even though they fail the media desperately

Larry I'm Canadian I grew up in Canada under a single payer\nI started a publication back in Nineteen eighty eight I'm I'm waiting their turn a guide to waiting lists the average Canadian family um wait\nTwenty one point two weeks from thing a primary care doctor to getting treatment by specialist Bernie Sanders want the Canadian health care system is that Medicare for all the time has come he wants the Canadian system but even more he wants to add vision care free drugs\nAnd um and and and and prediction care and and um you know of course he he has a bill before the Senate which had sixteen co sponsors for whom wants to become president\nAnd of course he never talks about what it would cost and how it would be paid for but it's Charles ... center said\nThirty two trillion dollars over ten years all private coverage under his plan Larry would be outlawed and you know a hundred and sixty million Americans\nHave employer sponsored insurance and the polls show they like it they would all lose their coverage immediately and we would all be like people in the u._k. under the national health service Canada under Medicare system\nThe waiting list or care would be rationed and our taxes would have to be increased significantly\nSally how would why why does a a Medicare for all seem to test so well among Democrats\n[noise] well I think you know Bernie started this back in twenty sixteen I'm Single payer have been around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenties\nA pair of being around Medicare for all for a long time but only in twenty sixteen when he was running against Hillary\nFor the Democratic presidential nomination he brought out his first single payer plan you know telling the American people that would be free and they would have the best healthcare and all and so you know the mainstream media picks up on this and plays it over and over again\nThat you know who wouldn't want something that's free but as I say he never talked about how it would be paid for and how much it would cost and so and then he has of course is I'm a new young sidekick Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\n... member of the Democratic socialist with America she is going around with Bernie telling candidates you know promoting candidates who support single payer and so it's really a being a very big move to the left for the Democratic party and I think we're going to see in this midterm election on November sex\nAre these candidates who are running to the left that Ben Jealous\nOr for governor of Maryland this I'm Andrew Gillum who is running against um [noise] the Santa for the governorship in Florida how do these people do to the American people are they finally understanding by people like you and me tell educating them on how terrible it would be what
