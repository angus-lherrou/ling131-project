thinking about your stuff dude I don't care what liberals why are you so obsessed with other people six asks why does it bother you so much\nWhy is it so off putting that you need to lay claim to other people's stuff constantly\n[laughter]\nIt's a serious question why are you in title to other people's stuff why how much of it and why did that what Thomas ... who I I don't know probably know\nThe economists slashed philosopher he's both I admire more currently alive today than Thomas or was it in him said at one point I I Can't remember between conflict divisions and visited the

like why do we owe you anything anymore why\nWhy do what do we owe you\n... call could not have been more illuminating\nReally I Am thankful she called I use you know take a to blow up the first call them and so much liberal he was kind of a moderate guy Cathy that was one of the greatest calls ever\nBecause that really sums up liberalism in a nutshell they have no idea what the numbers are they don't understand the facts they don't understand the economic data about tax\nPolicy they don't even know what marginal tax rates are they have no idea there convince other people have taken their stuff but when you ask them how exactly they took their stuff they can't tell you how exactly did rich people take yourself Willie talking well how what stuff that they\nTake they took my money what really where where was it worth a billion dollar how did they get that money from you know I don't know I just sounded good Bernie Sanders told me it was true\nThey're hypocrites there total fraud I remember running for office in Maryland I Can't tell the story and I I used to go there there's a the the Maryland the Montgomery County fair and I'd sit Montgomery County or a very very liberal County Maryland\n[noise] I Would sit there at the fair in front of the G O P booth and shake hands with people and one day the staffer for Chris Van Hollen it used to be represented now he's a senator from Maryland He stops and he's you know he knows who I Am so he's given me kind of the smart smart guy attitude\nAnd he starts getting it to me about tax policy has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't have any grasp of the numbers at all he's completely clueless so I got tired of listening to science that don't listen I have a really simple question for you\nSince you believe government is is that good right and we should all transfer our wealth to a bunch of bow tie wary bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me that you think this is a net good for society and you should ask this of all you're liberal friends\nHow much money argued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government did go how much\nThe answer I can almost assured you with near certainty is zero matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservative this is not a problem we are not hypocrites we know that government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need to liberals make the exact opposite argument\nNow with the government is such a force for good\nThe rich people should get more money to why why please explain to me how we have been paying into these anti poverty programs since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and a percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member to work has gone up knocked down\nWe have not moved the poverty rate in any significant way at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention Phil Gramm had a great piece of the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilized\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars and equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and a number of people working that have eligible family members that number percentage of people are working has gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else or to work that don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not to laugh\nWhile you simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hired accountants to avoid paying extra taxes to the government why did you do that why\nIf the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them don't be a phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger you that you're such a fake\nNo serious that you're a fraud when you look in the mirror aren't you like wow I'm a real phony I Love the government yet I Do everything in my power to pay accounts to avoid giving the government money doesn't that make you a fake how do you live like that\nNo I'm Serious I don't have that issue\nI look in the mirror go yeah the government really sucks patch I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts and the constitutional role of government where there's mass consensus based spent they waste money like no tomorrow government it's thanks it's a disaster I have no issue with that\nI look in the mirror know yep I Do everything that legally I can to pay as your tax dollars as possible\nBut not you frauds\nYou don't pay extra you want me to pay more\nYou don't do anything because you might say well than a couple of people\nDo voluntarily Petra I read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweed me I'm happy to hear\nBut I read a report a few years ago\nThat the record amount of money the government and brought in up until that time involuntary tax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government\nYou're never going to believe this number\nTwelve million dollars million not billion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars\nHave three hundred and thirty million people in this country are you telling me if I say let's be generous I'll play\nIf say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easier on the liberal say there are thirty million liberals was probably more than that probably closer to forty or fifty who would classify themselves as liberals say there's twenty five million if each of those liberals just donated a dollar\nTo the government\nThe government they worship that they genuinely liked in front of that that they they almost consider an act of religion and say if you just donated a dollar they would double the amount that voluntarily paid to the government the paltry twelve million dollars that's it\nTo step up stop being such frauds stop being such inauthentic fakes and fraud wake up tomorrow morning call your account ... and do the right thing\nAir quotes right thing because it's the wrong thing but you say it's the right thing\nRight a big fat usually check to the G\nGo do it call your account\nAnd come on five thousand ten thousand the government's a force for good or bad it took ... things take took gangs wants to change the go had knock yourselves out set\nAn example for the conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals focus labs\nWe donated an astonishing hundred billion dollars involuntary tax payments [noise] nice job liberals don't move but nice job at least you guys have a spy when she stood for something your big frauds\nPhony phony ease fakes\nLook yourself in the mirror and say I'm a big fake because you are\nI don't want to pay extra people everybody else does why why I give to charity I don't need someone else to do it\nI guess that we we my wife and I get the sorority\nWe sell short shorts on our website we donate the money is why I don't need anyone else to do it I don't look for other T shirt bankers\nBecause we think we're helping somebody I don't

New York times so my question to you is and I know you're talking about different things that are going on in the background yeah my question is\nIs there a grand jury is this guy will you know he only played out till lying you know he did more than live we know elite that a felony the in front of a grand jury well\nHere's here's what I find interesting about wealth\nWolf is a lawyer if you read back on some of the cage documents waltz lawyer at one point had um put out there that in walls defense because remember Wolff wasn't charged with leaking\nWolfe was charged and for for folks for those those you out they don't understand why this is James James I'm all for the Senate staffer on the intel committee that was handling it Spygate investigation he was arrested by federal agents for I'm lying\nAbout basically lying about leaking you wasn't arrested for leaking itself that's fascinating because in his defense his attorney was basically threatening to call who in his defense\nSenators on the Senate intel\nCommittee why is that interesting and fascinating about the game because if wolf is charged with lying about leak it\nAnd his lawyer saying no no he's not lying we're going to call the senators in his defense what does that tell you folks that maybe the senators on the intel committee may\nHave had some role in the selective leaking of information from the committee to the media to make Trump look bad that's why I find most cases fascinating wolf's case on one more thing about it\nToo\nPaul Wolff in the tax too is uh his girlfriend there who was working in writing stories for a couple of media outlets\nThere's a fascinating series of tax where he tax eighty two times to his girlfriend\nThe day they get a hold of the actual ... application\nWhat's fascinating about that the five applications how many pages only two\nEighty tango brother eighty two pages meaning what\nMeaning give significant pages were redacted which they are in the public document right\nHe didn't center of the adoption he may he may have center the Henri acted\nFinds application which means what it means the media's had this thing the whole time they know this case is complete crap they've noted the whole time and there's still propagating this myth that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians even though they've had the ... the application and they know it's crap does that make settled\nSo my question them take a little further um yeah we haven't been term coming up Trump held back releasing the redacted material the papers that the Congress the different Congress and wanted released it what what do you think and I know this is a kind of a it's not a fair question to you the endgame on this\nAnd above it's not a fair question to you the endgame on this\nNo I think they're perfectly average it\nPerfectly chick washing\nMueller's winding down that's what they tell us anyway and Trump has all the all these bullet in his holster what's the endgame is there a grand jury are they're going\nTo I'm going to give you a difficult but true answer here it is All right now about leverage Paul do view of the Mueller probe is a criminal investigation it's not it is ... ... it has criminal authority I get that I'm not trying to be silly\nThe Mueller probe is a political investigation designed to damage Donald Trump Donald Trump's approval numbers are

I'm Sorry I got all that you run ball I got to take a break for great question I'm simply suggesting to you in the audience here\nThat why expand the political capital of the classified now if you don't need it wait until\nAfter the midterms Donald Trump's approval is going up my everybody knows mothers which is a witch on their approvals going down not a convenient answer I get it I'm just
