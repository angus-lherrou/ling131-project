the kind of people\nThat you want to be spending some quality time with\nMan while you were out of having a life today that was going on the uh paid protesters there a heckling and harassing Joe Manchin who is they ask Joe Manchin the Republican and waiting\nI Wonder if that is going to happen to have no idea but there Joe Manchin of course has been the most moderate Democrat in the Senate mentioned after being twenty sixteen election but he wouldn't consider consider the ...\nThe governor the Democratic governor of West Virginia did put\nTo the question is uh is mansion next maybe he wins reelection Aaron and he goes to add an end up let me think but uh I was mentioning in the previous segment\nThat there's the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norm don't apply\nDonald Trump being president of the United states not your typical president and the movement that he learned twenty sixteen not your typical movement\nWhich has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nCould certainly aid the argument that we're in bits inflection point that things are different this is not your typical midterm election cycle to provide a a little more\nYour typical midterm election cycle to provide a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it\nSomebody and I've never seen and again I'm a student of history and I'm a student of information\nAnd to the point age began in the Nineteen thirties\nInformation about what we've been interested in what we've been into their mid term elections since the late Nineteen thirties right\nNever once not ever\nAs the most important issue to the average butter in\nThe United States Supreme court\nIt's come up a really high and presidential elections it was the number three as you and election day number three issue and election day twenty sixteen\nBut it's number one\nNumber one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind\nHowever their impassioned do vote\nWe are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change cabinet get confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe people are still that motivated by because hey we have other Supreme Court justices that come up here over the next couple of years right\nWell we are seeing right now\nAnd some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before\nYou have the Supreme Court and mentioned and then it goes to health care\nOK so after that which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time\nAnd anytime that politics that people\nAre different the outcomes absolutely have the potential to be too\nSo as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent\nAnd that is the potential\nFor what could happen\nIf there were a red wave that came out of this\nIf you had seven percent\nThat moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress or may because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of a backlash about Brett Kavanaugh you'll wind seven percent\nI mentioned that in this entire cabinet brought this entire process from the day after he was nominated\nUntil today\nSeven percent and movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here\nThose are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country\nUsually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and what you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential and this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote like you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history\nAnd you get out there and you're trying to make a difference\nBecause we do have a different landscape it's not all they are and the point and then in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you were in store for\nYou get out there make a difference if you're inclined\nAngry people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe mansion it's going to win hearts and minds when it's I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycle so what are you going to do with it\nAnd uh by the way I Want to give you a heads up on

I Believe the on at that point but not just in the political lady now in the financially you know he didn't have any now\nThat they eat or change the culture is increasing and those are all the trends and I'm\nLooking at a strong herded vain\nOn the other point to mention to vote on doing more to break up political system it has to do with what's happening locally in D.C who people know that the dude I cannot see\nHot to be his right to the poor thing party so both have to be the publications\nAnd that's why that's not seat in the DC collection of sway important ... thank you very much for that to sit for an agency called how to leave that to you\nI'm guessing the year as big of a dark as I Am are you an analyst\n[laughter] I have been an engineer or my life [laughter]\nOkay I had a feeling that it was somebody who was\nA of a a similar type of thought process anyway I Am not an engineer though not by a long shot I came and change a tire effectively just as my dad about that one\n[laughter]\nThat was one of the moments where I my background is in financial analysis and business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years love what I Do\nUh but uh but yeah I kind of work to be a law passed that way and uh when I and that ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in various different algorithms and in formulas and figuring out that hey if we have history we have the information we can do a lot of different things in in life with them\nOr beyond just a financial markets for example so anyway ah good stuff preach into Raj\nLet's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\nGood afternoon you know the two things that that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing when we saw that Dr giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was in motion ally\nDisturbed and there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously so sexual molestation but what\nWe tell petty we didn't show anger I have no animus towards the ...\nBut I think the biggest takeaway on this was the debauchery that to the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to\nPrevent something that was normal within you know the process of the government and there should be some Rican parents from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animals towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted this is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalties not necessarily innocent victims like Dr Ford who I really think she is\nBut the people who are behind that and directing it and in corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people are going to be punished\nI'm going to agree with all agree with Seventy five percent of your point you're I I Do want to ask you specifically you say that the you're not angry at at Christine forward here\nDo you feel that ah she did anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that\nBrett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nWell here's what we don't know we don't know what was said in her um sessions her therapy sessions I don't know that some therapists or some lawyer may have talk her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable\nMemories can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I\nI don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that ... I can see that she was used by people who didn't know enough\nI mean if it was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein whether brought it out they won she knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that the longer she waited the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it and putting the attorneys who have the child to begin with and in charge of it she knew that was another lose situation\n... well if the bored at she calculate wrong\nIt's interesting you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting point I still can't get there in in terms of her having necessarily been ... into this mindset remember she's a professional in the field\nI mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored and and memories are stored in the hippocampus was that they only won by the way when she pulled that out that went seriously this is how you're attempting to establish your credibility as a witness it was one of those moments where it's like okay [laughter]\nYou see what part of the birth tactic is there\nA but but anyway on you know I I still feel she's kind of a ... you go under oath you're you're involved in this process you say you're one hundred percent certain you provide all these witnesses and the thing that's odd to if she was going to end up being ... by you know it's I'm a psychologist but that these are the memories that you really had\nWhere was she of receipts all the names that she provided as the witnesses I mean that's typical for somebody who was a third party that wouldn't have been involved in that process to do\nAnd I've been involved in that process to to instill in her I just can't quite get there but otherwise very compelling and are interesting thought All right I Am Brian mud in for the great one\n\nIt's not smart job sites that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes but you know what is smart zip recruiter dot com slash Levin L.

especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense\nYou know what I should be do I should be part of that\nLet's be real for a moment ... those folks in D.C are ... ... they're paid these are folks who don't have live the rest of us we got to work we have lives and we uh you know they go about our business letter of the day and go oh okay that's what the losers were up to today yes those are all\nDay and go oh okay that's what the losers were up to today yes those are the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more if they're willing to get arrested so yes they did they are those people but nevertheless just in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating\nBut the second was talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate that's gone on for ever and a seemingly no resolution insight\nBut the other\nAspect of\nThat conversation that often is ever liked refugees\nAnd I have long had\nMy focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal\nAnd the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot of was made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the u._s. refugees in decades elite since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand our anticipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often\nThe implications\nThe applications\nAre we going to be compassionate to Americans before we try to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay you to bring the refugees into the United states average cost tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies that typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready to hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks\nSo we can actually relocate\nTo only sixty four refugee they enjoyed safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now\nHow compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we've made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that weren't skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration and not\nBringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\nSomething that's never just got\nBack on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that\nIs that anywhere near the entire we said no\nBut it absolutely is part of the reason\nPeople automatically suggests that we have a responsibility\nAnd that kind of cost to import people in the competed against the most vulnerable in our society\nReally cared about the most vulnerable in society you give them the opportunity\nThat Donald Trump has been doing\nHis policy\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media [noise]\nTwo sides to stories one side of the fact I'm Brian mud and for the great one remark or the\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Iraq\nThey didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief so he engage them after my got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... as the and seeds status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there is nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on Nathaniel spy happen till the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands of resolve this tax that for a good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now phew oh back taxes to the IRS call my friends at optimal tax relief\nAnd uh let's see I I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer all go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another at a police officer want to hear from you in\nAre you tonight hey doing well\nFantastic no I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement out for six years and [noise]\nI've been in law enforcement now for six years and\nIt's especially coming from my department you you just see a face to face 'cause we are in a college town itself so\nI'm everything that the media puts out toward this they're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and are the folks who served with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in again I Do the series down here in South Florida every week\nI Will tell you that there is a lot of support\nKind of like the silent majority that came out and made Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom of the United states of America and twenty sixteen than at any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nOut there are a lot of good folks that that really do get it in that do support you know just Albany than depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but the state's wrong and and thank you guys are all you do or certainly is appreciated\nBy we'll switch gears go back to senator Collins and her big day Joe in Gainesville, Florida Joe go\n[noise] did you\nDo you're up [noise]\nAlright Joe you're you're you're up let's go to Glen in Springfield, Illinois\nGlenn go\nOut and Brian uh can you hear me good yeah we got you\nOkay hey thanks for taking my call and thank you for all that you know\nI'm I'm call on a\nSome central Illinois I'm I'm proud to say that Springfield is my home town that's where I'm calling from\nBut I'm I'm afraid to say I'm not proud that turban from my home town ... and uh I heard some of the comments that he made the other day a face to face to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I was appalled ah that's there's no uh respect there no oh ah no ah professional demeanor now\nAnd I think that Dick Durbin and and and I'm saying it I Want to his constituents Springfield, Illinois\nTake care of an old saying that apology and out and I I I credit senator college it's refreshing that she took the time to sit down with this man and get a one on one card I have a conversation with him\nI gave her credit for that no doubt on\nHer finest moment and uh you're absolutely right about job and then all the others are named me how many politicians though we we started with Chuck Schumer today and the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation line\nHe\nBefore we heard or anything from from Christine Ford before we had any\nFacts present it said that he believes her in what\nHappened in this country in part\nBecause of people like Dick Durbin because of people like Chuck Schumer\nWho said that they believed her\nThat's all part of the damage that was done in this country\nGo to Anthony in New York Anthony go\nBy how would you argue
