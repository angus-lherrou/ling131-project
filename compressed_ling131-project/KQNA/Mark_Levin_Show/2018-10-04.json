know my habits so\nI'm so impressed by the quality of the journalism and the care with which this has done but there's really a larger political message here which is that if you get a W to like most people you get a salary\nYou have basically no chance to to to cheat on your taxes I mean they they they would hold a certain amount every sort of how taxes work in this country but if you're rich like the Trump you can set up a system and they detail in the most extraordinary way houses done\nAnd I'm not an important thing to know now is that the IRS is being caught by the Republicans\nOver and over again so they have no investigators to ferret stuff out like this so it's open\nSeason for people who can hire lawyers and create scams wiling to the president's\nLied cheated and stole in lied to us repeatedly starting with the Obama versus ticket if you think people like Sarah Daniels in those allies are insignificant and getting off a plane for meeting North Korean leader and saying we're safer and then realizing months later there is no agreement on what happens with North Korean missile\nHow about cheating in this case in personal relationships where he said he knew nothing and he paid off a playboy model and uphold the answer when she told us on there is no and then we're supposed to look at this and say hey we tell our kids don't shoot the schools\nDon't lie and steal from

of the level of detail that could be acquired by anyone who doesn't have to pay the power the detail it goes over there and by the way someone who looks to me this hour has already said yesterday that indicated just as the publication and they want to look into all this\nI mean the detail and here is really revealing and I mean if you look at for example a ... they were so they're discussing is when the father's assets had to be transferred to the children and they talk about it in great specificity two distinct for use to evaluate those ads and doesn't minimize the potential estate tax

welcome back to the pro should rethink you so much for taking the time I appreciate it\nThanks Larry it's always an honor to be on your show\nRead you read the New York times article variable fourteen thousand words did Trump or his father or other members of the family engagement something illegal\n[noise] [noise] well you know what I'm a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seem to provide 'em you know there's there are a few things in his proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of the law\nUm what what what bothered me about the er the article authors obviously showed their bias in several places\nI'm One of which where they say that the the rich never really pay there for 'em and uh there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which\nIf I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure Tom suppose that I'm half a million dollars\nI'm supposed that I'd half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price\nNow what is that worth to me what is that included in my network has like if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be\nOne of the value of the get dollars because it would be subject to the mortgage and so now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three when everybody lost value in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children mhm so now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that tax return\nWhat four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minor the four hundred thousand dollar mortgage that's twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift now decades later there's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers development of of of various sizes\nAnd I sell or my children sell that house for several hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep re hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point\nBut they get three hundred thousand dollars and then\nOne could say they got the times the valuation of the gift but you see that was perfectly legal but I didn't but the article doesn't explain the leverage of real estate and so as a result I mean you you can easily said my gosh\nHow could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something fell at ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was one it was given\nReal charge recharge my guess he's an attack mistake planning lawyer or there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nThought well and the one that I really found to bury serious is there's there's a there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape or you know just drowning in debt\nThat apparently his father or sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of chip\nRead them and put you on hold for for ... for for this we're gonna pick that on the other side I remember when that happened some some guy went in there and bought three point five million dollars worth of chips giving simply the casino that my
