thing and drop or I I really just serve justice surveys that are you know Trump throughout it right has a very ... it's an investigation number one number two he repeatedly they found that the the Saudi rulers throughout it\nOkay he's not even leaning on our on our on a ... you know it's\nLike a farce of all what you're saying is dishonest\nHe said over and over again he wants to know the facts [noise] this is a moving target that's the way it is he wants to know the information he wants to another you see unlike you and I'm like these cheap shot reporters and commentators on TV this president has a country to run and he has to figure out as best as he's able to\nWhat's in the best interests of the United states of America and the citizens of the United states of America\nSo he's not just going to call a talk show or or get on a cable show or or pop off about about this that and the other\nAnd he's here he's been sort of adjusting his message is more information comes off a comes in and as he gets more advice on what to do plus there are things going on in the middle East that he's involved in in his stamps involved in that you and I can't even imagine\nSo what do you want him to do well let's say the royal families guilty I Know they're guilty or cutting off all relations with them but that make you happy\nNow oh I totally agree with them for a faraway yourself but that last thing that you just set a second ago you're right it for that investigation helped my point is you know it's not over get the information number one\nAnd then make some decisions right but he kicked defending those guys the Saudis they've gotten a nice guy either really bad guy they'd do a lot of bad stuff and why ... why do you get the loan guys\nWeathers who keep defending those guys trust spies those guys\nShe said I don't think he's defending those guys I mean again I I've been sort of observing this from afar over the last the period of time since uh since the Turks put out the information that he was murdered\n[noise] I don't seem defending those guys if he's defending those guys why did the old man the king step in and take the power back from the sun to try and deal with that situation\nWhere ... you know have already come out several times he came out that role excuse early on that from that so that's all wrong you know you have no evidence yet okay let me\nTalk for all why are we so focused on this\nWell because it's important it's the truth\nAbout honestly it's not that important it's a horrible thing that took place\nA horrible thing that took place but I I hate to say this because I Know it will be twisted in four thousand different ways but for the United states it's simply not that important\nI mean giving a hundred and fifty billion dollars for the Iranian regime which killed which was involved in killing thousands of American Soldiers that to me is a big damn deal\nBut you know the media and the ... supported that deal\nObama supported that deal\nThat is a terrorist regime that is an enemy of the United states now I'm not making any excuses\nPitch man was Florida and in a horrific way great horrible horrible horrible horrible\nBut I don't know why are the coverage is is is so massive and either deal\nI'm just looking for truth Perrier okay and I don't hear a great\nMan no matter what they say All right thank you sir the truth is the Saudis murder\nThat we know\nAnd do I believe the royal family wasn't Bob certainly part of that certainly the crown prince in my view how the hell are they do this without knowing some of them were his right hand one of them was his right hand ... and I believe one of his intelligence ... census top forensic guy over there isn't really any doubt about\nThis no there's no doubt about it\n\nBut we'll wait for the investigation will get all the facts you know but what do you what the president to do\nHe says they're going to be the fear that a severe ramifications but he's not cutting off the military so\nSo what else do you want them to do I'm quite serious about this I hear that criticism any suggestions what do you want him to do\nAnd uh I understand the Washington Post as all worked up about this and other media outlets I got I understand it and I understand\nThat people are upset about it I don't like it at all I think it's outrageous I'm no fan of the Saudi regime and I never have been\nBut I'm not talking about any of that I'm Talking about the ...\nBut I'm not talking about any of that I'm Talking about the reporting is over the top in the sense that it is nonstop\nAnd there's so many other things going on in this country in the world but at least deserves some attention\n\nI don't know that they'll ever get to the bottom of this

shattering but unfortunately in Washington DC it too often it is and\nWe all know that when we get out there on the campaign trail and you and your listeners know that the failures in Washington\nStem from their failure to do what they said they would do that is why Trump is successful and why people are a proud that support him is because when he says he's going to do something he had to do it the Republicans in Congress\nFailed to do that they failed to repeal Obamacare they failed to balance the budget and they run away for security and the consequences are dire or seeing people with two and

stagnation what's causing the lack of the ability to build a building out of the jobs that we need a lack of economic growth which obviously harm to the deficit and debt as well and now what do we think\nWe're seeing four percent economic growth or seeing the United states for the first time in a decade label is the most competitive nation on earth right we're seeing a jobless claims of all
