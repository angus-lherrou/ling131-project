they'll take my advice or that\nAre good to be here and great to be here in fact and I've got a lot to talk to you about in terms of ah ... how the resistance is manifesting itself in our nation's capital to great article today terrific articles\nThat are in from two completely different publications explaining exactly how\nThe organized resistance left has been undermining this president since day one and continue to do so and and stuff you don't really see in the papers necessarily but it just as insidious if not as dangerous as\nThe protests in the streets I'm going to get to that in a moment but first I Want to tell you about our police the brand new book by marks dad jak live and that was out October thirtieth but you can pre order it now at Amazon and it's about our police it's meant for children and grandchildren\nWho need to understand inhabit reinforced in their lives how critically important and special an admirable\nThe police are in our lives and uh it if it's that like any objects other books it's gonna be a cherished possession and a fantastic president whether you celebrate Christmas\nOr Hanukkah or if you're going to have a righteous Kwanzaa I don't care what it is you can order the books now in your children your grandchildren are absolutely going to love it and God Knows they're not getting this message\nFrom the public schools or or from television these days so please get our police you can pre order them as on by jak within that marks dad and I know that the Libyan family will appreciate that\nLet's start with the wall Street Journal or the headline in their editorial today [noise]\nHeadline in their editorial today ending the nominations blockade\nKeep Democrats in DC until every pending nominees confirmed now I Know mark talks a lot about what Mitch McConnell has been able to do\nA listen we have a lot of corals with Mitch McConnell is the majority leader in the Senate but in one respect he has done a woman's job and that is in getting judicial nominees through\nUh the president has done an incredible job with his advisors in nominating fantastic judges and in the cases of Gorsuch and Kavanaugh too fantastic justice as\nAnd as far as the Justice Department is concerned as far as the\nJudicial branch of our government the Senate's been doing a pretty okay job in pushing through a lot of those nominees and a lot of those judges they could do more though what\nIs not discussed very often\nEspecially because it's now almost two years into this administration what often does not get the attention that the mainstream media should be giving it is that as of now president Donald Trump\nAnd and the navy at Wall Street journal points out they are an urgent need for legal direction they've got to deal with the fallout from recent ship accidents as well as lawsuits against bases in Guam and Maine\nNothing but there's no one there to guide the ship if I may use upon there for the department of the navy\nDemocrats have also blocked Justin moose in it for the number two posted treasury since his nomination in April\nTreasury could use the former banker who has taught at Columbia Business school to shore up its financial crisis management three appellate court and some thirty six a district court nominations are also awaiting a Senate floor vote\n\n... this is just one example I've got another amazing article here that you need to hear about it as well that shows you this is the resistance and how it plays out\nAnd and you know as the new senators they like to play you know gentlemanly right they liked as a way where the world's greatest deliberative body or where the Senate after all my good friends are great and distinguished man from New Jersey Cory Booker how do you see those words without throwing up in the back of your mouth a little bit\nAnd they like to pretend that they're so congenial they like to pretend that they treat each other like gentleman in general women and they follow this long tradition of rules that were set by our founding fathers and I appreciate that I really do\nBut it got to take a moment and look up at the seat there and recognize that it's not John Adams presiding over the Senate at this point and when you look across the aisle we're not looking at founding fathers were looking at ... Harris\nAnd we're looking at Chuck Schumer and they're playing hardball with our federal government and positions that demand to be filled not today not tomorrow last year\nAnd this is the resistance party and this is how it plays out in the United States Senate so you wonder jeez why isn't the government functioning as well as the quarter well as the ... I'll tell you why because this president hasn't even been able to get his men and women in place to do the job he wants them to do\n\nThat the resistance party and that's why they can't win I'm Larry O'Connor in for the great one it's the mark living in show [noise] month\nMay ...\nDo you remember when comedy was re wasn't political it wasn't profane and it wasn't worried about hurting someone's feelings well after being gone for far too long great comedy is announcing see our TVs main combination great again who are coming from forming a theater near you find tickets for it later\nNear you and me commenting rain again dot com that night of one hundred\nPercent clean politics free stand up comedy featuring an entire\nLine of a comedian who Iran I mean you land when you were saying how Larry is a laugh out\nLoud language label three main comedy training in tour featuring comedian like Tim Allen Brett I'm married and many more to me was always meant to be\nGray line change where I live near you and me commenting great again that remain calm any great again I mean comedy great again down\nFor the first time ever the crossroads of ... comes to the ... valley events that are those ...\nAnd everything we're looking for\nOf states of America as we're going to show great deals and guns and ammunition scopes accessories and more so I'm at wholesale prices most jewelry if the ideas door prizes Guerra threw find the best part and come back and buy a crossroads of what's going to show this weekend the Prescott valley of its officers license\nAwesome yeah just a lot more than I second\nIn the field or conducted in compliance with applicable all you can buy selling trade at whole cross roads go to shows\nMay not strike twice but love dies\nJoining me not strike twice but love does especially if it's a Subaru friendly Subaru invites you to the love strikes twice sales have been leading up to the grand opening of our new state of the art facility November ten\nPromises to be rewarding shopping experience showcasing the outstanding super lineup loves strikes twice it mainly Subaru with the second big amount of savings on remaining new twenty Eighteen\nIf you've been putting it on this really is the month to take a test drive and fall in love with a new family Subaru Forester financing new twenty Eighteenth ...

and no long if Democrats majority of the communist we'd better wake up in America are\nPaid was that the second point you wanted to make yes I did excellent Pete and Long Island thanks for the call good to hear your voice on the mark living show about Tom Green Bay Wisconsin where my red skins really handed your your pack or it's a tough one a couple of weeks ago Tom you W excuse me you're on the market in show\nYeah so I watch it a picture and old western is saying and the past with an angry mob with torches marching toward a jail cell demanding to hang a man who's actually innocent inside that man and side was justice cabin on the person that prevented it was sheriff Trump\nThat's yeah that's actually how rich\nIt's a beautiful image time because that's exactly how it came to you know do you think there's any other Republican maybe Ted Cruz maybe take his butt of the of the sixteen Seventeen Republicans running for president\nI think maybe Trump and crews were the only ones who have the fortitude and the I don't give a crap attitude about the media and the left and the Democrats to his stood by justice Kevin uh do you have any doubt that any of those other Republicans would have folded like a a a cheap tent\nI I ever that faith and a Tom Cotton as well but\nHe just he just wasn't running last time I was talking about the the ones who were up\nYeah I Know the ones that are out but you know what can we do about this angry mob mob is led by Chuck Schumer and make no mistake about it and nobody could have made this decision accept him\nBecause he had a big choice yet either it takes the chance and roll dice and makes an outrageous claiming and the swatter is an innocence man's reputation or does the reasonable thing and gets five senators who are Democrats to vote with the judge\nHe gamble and lost and what's the consequence for Chuck Schumer\nKevin McCarthy is going to roll out legislation to to for the house of rap stuff on the wall and all of the Republican senators need to support that by going up to the microphone and saying if we win this election\nWe support passing it in the Senate by simple majority that should be the consequences for Chuck Schumer doing this filthy nasty evil thing that is that the Kavanaugh because all ...\nWhat the Democrats as completely gone now there's no reason to have the stupid filibuster and structure where it needs to how to deal with it completely taken away\nWell said Tom well said you can drop the Mike on that one except for one last question is your great Governor Scott Walker gonna pull this one out that he got a pretty good pull the other day but it's still looking pretty close what are you hearing on the streets\n[noise] it's hard to gauge the state the state has cycle because it it\nWe had when we had our great Governor Tommy Thompson we had a horrible Democrats than of terrorists and now we finally have a Republican I'm assembly and a Republican Senate and our CIA and Republican governor but there is this tidal wave\nOf Madison and Milwaukee and its counterbalance by the other people at work and the rural area I Know urban areas but it's it's I think he's gonna do it I\nI don't think I Hope that it I I don't think the polls are accurate because people shy away from admitting they're Republicans because right now we are ... you know just going to get the last\nWell yeah listen I Know what the cultures like up there Tom in Green Bay Wisconsin thank you for the call I Know and I think that's that's pretty I think that's the same pretty much everywhere in this country right now where people are Republicans conservatives with Trump supporters they just keep their head down they're not taking the call from a poll street or who's on the other end of that line\nYou don't have time you're busy you have a job that's why the polls were so wrong almost every time that's why they've been around about Scott Walker in Wisconsin from his first election to the recall election to the reelection but Wisconsin's economy is finally blooming\nBecause of the conservative policies economic policies that Walker and the Republicans and Madison to put forth I sure hope he when he was a good man\nI promise you another article to show you how the resistance in it's insidious way is a is is stopping and impeding the regular functions of our government and this one in real clear investigations this article which also share on my Twitter Larry O'Connor\nUh this one tells you how the hidden hand of Mike Bloomberg is behind it all\nThe headline is how Bloomberg embed green warriors in blue state governments it's by Jeff Patrick real clear investigations to very well researched investigation is a long article give you the synopsis of it though in New York University school of law program funded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg who by the white wants to be president\nHe's officially he will be running for the Democrats there's going to be like twenty twenty five nominees running for the Democrats their first debate is like in six months it's gonna be in spring of twenty Nineteen I Can't wait is going to be phenomenal to see them all ... each other alive and tried to be a ... as socialist as possible to win the nomination\nIt's going to be a complete disaster for them and I can't wait popping the popcorn now Michael Bloomberg is placing lawyers in the offices of democratic state attorneys general and paying them to prosecute energy companies and challenge Trump Administration policies on energy and the environment\nYou understand what that opening something said this is a program at the NYU school of law it's funded by Bloomberg\nAnd they place lawyers in the offices of the state's attorney general\nAnd and their job they're getting money from the NYU law program not from the state but they're working in the state attorneys general office\nTo sue the Trump Administration\nAnd energy companies nine states continuing on the article nine states and Washington DC including New York Illinois in Pennsylvania are participating in a multi million dollar program funded by the media magnate\nAn ex New York city mayor who re registered as a Democrat this week I'm an expectation of a run for president in twenty twenty the fourteen current fellows in the program report to the attorneys general\nBut they are paid by NYU's Bloomberg funded state energy and environmental impact center where these these these socialist groups all have these insidious names\nThe state energy and environmental impact center\nNames the state energy and environmental impact center it's just a big slush fund to pay lawyers to disrupt the Trump Administration\nAnd to make life miserable for energy companies state AG offices hire these trained lawyers not students but season professionals with years of experience as special assistant attorney general the sea Howard city assistance\nThey're special assistant attorney general they don't work for the state but the answer to the state attorney general\nUnder terms of the arrangement the fellows works solely to advance progressive environmental policy at a time when democratic state attorneys general have investigated ensued Exxon Mobil and other energy companies over alleged damage due to climate change\nAlthough many government agencies have employees funded by outside sources critics say using special interest money for targeting government action is inappropriate yeah I'm One critic who would say that\nSays outrageous New York Pennsylvania are you happy with us\nChristopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the AG officers must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions Horner said\nDavid ... is the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we got it we got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBlumberg throws millions of dollars at this NYU program the NYU that hires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his budget doesn't come out of the state budget\nThey answer to the attorney general but you know who's bidding they're doing they're not doing the bidding of you that voter you the people in most states they're doing the bidding of where the money's coming from\nThis program at NYU funded by Bloomberg that specifically that ensues Exxon Mobil Chesapeake why but whatever oil company in this country\nOr sues the PA and the Trump Administration trying to shut down progress trying to shut down our economy trying to shut down fracking oil drilling\nSo that they can do the bidding of the well funded environmental wackos\nAnd this is going on in your state\nAnd it's disrupting the progress of our federal government and the EPA that President Trump is in charge of and why because they can't win at the ballot box\nThey can't win in the elections and so they just throw a bunch of money at lawyers and they tried to sue everybody to try to get their way and try to push their agenda\n[noise]\nI'm Larry O'Connor that this is the market within a month\nWere the dog in the quantities and eleven thirty

you know every every candidate creates an organization of fundraising organizational structure right when he became president he didn't dismantle\nHis his fundraising capability or any of his outrage or any of the things he just converted Obama for America to a political action committee called organizing for America was still OSHA the he could keep the same logo it went from Obama for America to organizing for America has been a constant\nConstant community organizing effort at the highest level with the greatest budget that any community organizing entity is ever had and it in it\nLiterally
