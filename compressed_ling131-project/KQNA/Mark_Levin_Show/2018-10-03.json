does support the demands by Democrats on Capitol Hill for the president's tax returns going back Twenty years Thirty years whatever is necessary\n[noise] they are they're really seeking to destroy\nAnyone who disagrees with them anyone who wins an election with whom they disagree anybody who might go on the Supreme Court with whom we disagree this was all out political warfare now ladies and gentlemen it is all out political warfare\nThere's no question in my mind about this\nAnd the things that some of these media types say on TV\nAre really are I'm concerned spring while a behavior and will spur more wind with a hammer\nThese politicians being chased into restaurants you know I find certain politicians on Capitol Hill contemptible so we're never going to a restaurant and confront them or disrupt their dinner or anything of the ...\nIt's a totally different mindset\nI wouldn't go to a protest with a bag of with a sock full of uh pennies or coins or rocks forever for the purpose of slamming somebody in the back of the ...\nSay I think that the what the left has reaped is upon us\nI really believe that\nAnd we're always on defense there never on defense\nJonathan Lexington, Kentucky they great W. V. I. okay go\nHey mark how're you doing today very well thank you sir so I wanted to come in and talk come on to talk about my governor Matt Bevin so I don't have cable so I wasn't able to watch your show but I got it then let me just say is doing a job that doesn't even\nBuried or if he doesn't even quit because of the iceberg\nBut let me just say one of the reasons I was disappointed that the time it was aired among many is a I Believe this man is presidential material and I think a great\nDisservice was done to you to me to him on Sunday night I think he's president material and I\nYeah I thought he demonstrated that during the course of the interview and he was talking about the national scene and silver wasn't a parochial a interview of any kind a but he's got charisma he's extremely articulate he's very conservative apps then\nI Would say during the primaries that if we can truth and Donald Trump it'd be like that and he had a rock brick conservative values had truth but the straightforward attitude of Donald Trump but despite that no matter who I talked to Kentucky everyone hates and for some reason I\nThought well I'll tell you why and I don't know about everyone 'cause he's taking on you've got a disastrous pension situation you're the worse than the entire country worse than New York Illinois and California [noise]\nAh he pushed for right to a a right to work in your state or he's pushed to uh to cut spending and cut taxes so he's doing all those things\nAre worthy entrenched a left and there are supporters in government and in the media oppose so he's been trashed but\nBut he really is terrific in many respects\nAnd I'm so grateful that you said that because people need to hear this and if we elect than out next year than saying that we don't know what a great if he does he\nAll right Jonathan thank you for your call let's go to John Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that great W.

S. L. and go\nHey mark I root for sure what you're doing\nA love the ... the bottom of the first hour about the federalist papers yeah and I wanted to add one thing to that you know a drawn out of them understood or even Republican but they were coming up or wasn't enough\nMoney so that uh [noise] our constitution was married for them or was made only for a moral and religious people and all inadequate to the governance of any other I think to really know I agree\nBut it doesn't there was any damn good we're living in the middle of this thing and we're trying to save it right\nRight that's where we need to get people back to religion with morality um but I also have a question or you know from a terminal thing just watching all nonsense I wondering how many people would we have in politics Fifteen foolishness disqualified them\nWhile we have very few in the Republican side on the Democrats' side how many people William politics of adult foolishness to find them and I think every day and want to thank you for your call my friend\nAnd the worse the higher up the Democrat chain they go Bill Clinton's accused of rape they nominated for president Ted Kennedy or with

hit\nFred Trump has been gone for nearly Twenty years and it's sad to witness this misleading attack against the Trump family by the failing New York times\nMany decades ago the iris reviewed and signed off on these transactions\nThe New York times and other media outlets credibility with the American people as in an all time low because they are consumed with attacking the president and his family instead of reporting the news the truth is the market is an all time high unemployment is a fifty year low taxes for families and businesses have been cut\nWages are up and so forth and so on\nPerhaps another apology from the New York\nTimes like the one they had the issue after they got the twenty sixteen election some virus only wrong is in order [noise]\nWe don't know why the Irish

once in a while and he's got a little golf course that will play out and have a very nice guy and one of his recipes isn't the cookbook and he loves this thing called crispy crackling pork loin which is you take a pork loin and you've got to get a special caught because uh\nMost pork loin stone have skin on it but you need the skin because you put it in a five hundred degree of it and you just absolutely new thing you cook it for three hours\nAnd the skin becomes so correctly it it's a delicacy and I was talking to various it's Stuart what's yours and I was expecting something completely\nDifferent fishing ships I Would think a very recently\n[laughter] I was expecting something British uh but he said exactly the same thing and apparently it's a it's a an English thing it's popular in Australia and so that's one of the recipes in the in the cookbook if in fact it's on the back cover the darn thing\nBeautiful and you've got a lot of very cool recipes and here at about by you and your wife too which is a which is really something worth a look you know let me ask you a question here is a New York times comes up with this long article and I now read most of it\nReally trashing the president trashing his father traction making these these these brought statements about how they're centrally tax cheats going back twenty more than Twenty years\nAnd um and they and they basically lost the IRS and they said well the Internal Revenue service basically you know look the other way and so for\nNow the Internal Revenue service doesn't look the other way right and this is a huge ah you know family business it's a privately held business I don't know how they got access to all this stuff so I don't know if it was in the\nIn the filings with the state or or whatever it was but they are trashing Trump as he's not a self made man and look at all the money he got when he was a kid and and on and on and on this is really a set up as in it for the Democrats will keep saying we want Trump's taxes and they're kind of hand in glove working with each other here in the political way\nBut that's their playbook that only God I mean they're still litigating the twenty sixteen election they cannot believe they lost to this guy\nAnd why did they lose sure because he cheated and he didn't just shoot at you know colluding with the Russians he cheated his entire business career and his family cheated his dad cheated they screw people in the welfare system so that they would get rich and ... you know the allegation is you know\nHe had said that he started Donald Trump did with just a million of his father's dollars\nBut you know this story says oh what are they talking about I think I think I read four hundred and Fifteen million dollars is what his dad gave him so he wasn't a self made guy he was a bold him to his father who was a cheater as well\nCrazy but you know let's let's see what the facts are right now it's just one of these allegations that it's been linked to a major\nParty but isn't it isn't this the problem a huge article yes one allegation after another and what are we going to spend the next six weeks on this right through the mid term elections it's all time though I don't ever remember anything like this on the Kennedy family or had LBJ became a multi millionaire just\nA poor man they got elected to the Senate he died a multi multi millionaire I mean so much and and Trump makes all this money before even enters the presidency\nAnd they just can't wait to get their hands around his neck\nHow many times mark have we seen in the last year because it's been very effective\nThat are members of the left and the Democrats in particular have or have worked with politicians you ... you want to talk about a collusion look at\nThe link between the press and some a liberal Democrats for instance I I was watching the special report program on Fox News and a a young correspondent who used to live at my house uh Peter do see that who you were talking about a minute ago\nYou know he's out in Montana and he was covering this story about\nUh the reelection campaign of John tester\nAnd Jon Tester's got a problem right now because a lot of Montanans are veterans\nAnd they don't like what he did to Dr Ronny Jackson who is the president's picked to run the VA\nBecause if you remember Jon Tester leaked these are allegations unfounded allegations are I think he first started out on the floor of the Senate or it was in a committee hearing he\nHad these pages this stuff about how Ronny Jackson was a drunk and he crashed the car someplace any did these inappropriate things and he was given people bills and all that stuff\nAnd you know what then it got into the bloodstream of the media and everybody was talking about it in the White House came out uh like within a day and said\nLook we've done an investigation we can't find anywhere that he crashed the car or these other allegations but the damage was done and he was dead it was a kill shot it all started with unfounded allegations and that brings us right to where we are today how many times have we seen these things\nAnd it's just that they keep doing it because it's work\nSays well I Want to recommend that people have a little diversion here this is a really wonderful a cookbook and uh it's a wonderful thing to put on your cocktail table to you and your wife are on the cover that happy cookbooks steam and Cathy do see I Want to wish you all the best for this\nThank you great one worked well All right God Bless you God Bless you All

great to be an hour you can be with you Steve and you heard that into the gentleman that called me and and ... and demanded that I Apologize now that quote Trump is exceptionally renegotiated NAFTA ... should I Apologize\nAnd this is a huge victory for Donald Trump I mean you know we've got a new NAFTA modernize now the by the way I I always thought now there was a pretty good thing I mean it is the unified a North American continent or Canada Mexico and the United states and\nUh but it needed to be modernized there were a lot of things and then after that that were out of date and were unfair and you know Trump\nHad a big victory here first she got Mexico to sign on and then each you know tighten the screws on Canada\nAnd they made some real concessions here Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make but you know it was interesting 'cause last Wednesday Donald Trump they press conference and he said at the conference things aren't going very well with Canada and they don't come around and agree to some of our terms here we're going after\nYou know go ahead with just with Mexico and I'll be out in the cold and we'll slapped on what the twenty five percent I don't care\nI wake up at six am on Monday morning and I hear the news that Canada has signed onto this agreement it's good for all three countries but no longer will they up to three hundred percent dairy tariffs felt this was a big win for our farmers um and and now they're such a Trump very nicely\nFor um for negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst uh you know abusers of the trade laws and on the planet\nOne of a quick thing Larry I was there yesterday at the rose garden when Donald Trump has passed out that's one of the points you made his he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a has a negotiating tactic\nTo get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the topic but what is it working because these countries are reducing their cherished\nStephen Moore is my guest the economic advisor to President Trump during the twenty sixteen campaign even a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased um their economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of economics\nOf top economists found Ninety six percent agreed or strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deal so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually help now your help the caps now they're back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this with the best of all worlds you know I my opinion we have a we have a a a a a a new a free trade agreement is now called the uh you asked them to see a we're not going to call NAFTA any longer\nBut it is a new a North American trade agreement that will open up orders a between all three countries\nIt is modernized against America has a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nMy understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on us\nStanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage job in other countries right and that that's one of the things I don't like about this the also very it got me on that one that's not you know we would we want Mexico they have a twenty dollar minimum wage I Would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan that show I mean I agree with you on that one\nAnd so on par though this bill lower tariffs and barriers are up for a candidate has imposed against us and Louis terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just the way he was just one quick thing they're not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we talked about this on your show the war and more of what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce computer software we Patton sent copyrights\nAnd technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and something and certainly China and\nAnd and many other countries in Asian countries they just steal our intellectual property and this new um now that has very strongly that this new uh I'll call it the U.S she I make as much better protections for not America's intellectual property so countries\nAre going to use our products they actually pay for them\nEven more is my guest he served as a top economic advisor to President Trump and the twenty sixteen campaign even you recall President Obama famously saying these jobs aren't coming back what magic wand does a president have what do you think people who felt that way feel right now about this deal\nWell first of all you know what to what Obama was referring to as you said you know he can't get us to four percent economic growth and it can't bring manufacturing jobs in construction jobs back to this country and they kept bringing coal jobs back and maybe just maybe Donald Trump that was out of a magic wand because we do we do have\nA job since the election one million additional construction manufacturing a mining jobs and this happened Larry because of things you talk about every night on your show we lower the burden of taxation we lower the burden of regulation we allow companies to do their thing got government off the back of our businesses\nAnd you know the twenty seven million small businessmen and women in this country respond to that and they are hiring more people I don't know if you saw the news today that uh\nThat uh one of the major um Amazon I Believe it was there were all raised their wages to Fifteen dollars an hour I don't want the government to tell companies to do that\nBut they're doing it because it's a tight labor market the economy is booming it's hard to get workers uh this is exactly what we tried to do when we put this plan together Larry Kudlow and I for Donald Trump two years ago\nStephen Moore is my guest he's an economist even take the last minute and talk to us about about debt and about the tournaments program but even Obama said we're automatic pilot or this president has done a lot of things we talked about the tax cuts the regulatory relief but he's also spent money especially on defense and so our debt has increased are you worried about the\n... well you
