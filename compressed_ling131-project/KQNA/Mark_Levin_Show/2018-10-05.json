witnesses whatsoever\nIt's whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever\n\nAnd not\nKnow collaboration whatsoever no witnesses whatsoever no evidence whatsoever they went back and they interviewed people\nAnd so they trashed the FBI report while they didn't interviewed Dr Ford there's nothing to ask Dr Ford and if they did interviewed Dr for it\nReally then you would need a criminal investigation of which this is not a for her to explain her inconsistencies and so forth and all these witnesses who she says she has or doesn't have would have to be interviewed in that context but they aren't\n\nSo there's very little discussion about that that is the fact that the FBI report found that there is no cooperation\nIs that not a big deal Chuck Grassley\nWas pretty good today he went up behind the

T. Fairfax, Virginia the great WMA out go\nA Mark I'm really thrilled to be on the air with us my name is Jacob do it all and my father was a conservative Republican a U.S representative from northern California for Eighteen years\nTime remember his name\nYet uh the corrupt media Democrats under Nancy Pelosi as well as the corrupt leadership of the Justice Department or worked very hard to ruin my father and our family or they had to fight hard for eight years in and spend over a million dollars in legal fees\nRemind me what happened well they were my dad was in the Republican leadership and they were friendly with Jackie from off and just by a guilt by association they are Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats\nTried to tried to take my dad and my family down but unfortunately or fortunately excuse me after eight years or putting them severely financially I'm dead or my parents were able to weather the storm and and come out victorious whether charges brought against them\nNot a single indictment there were eight years of investigation or put them a million dollars to spend a million dollars just defending themselves my dad I\nCan imagine folks being investigated for eight years\nEight years that the FBI still hasn't returned some of the personal effects\nAre they took from my family so this whole cabinet that tuition very much to um to me because I Believe they've tried to do the same thing to this good man as their time with my father the good with my dad weather the storm even though my parents were ruined financially they didn't fold under the pressure to admit to something they didn't do and thankfully neither is cabinet\nOr the real reason I'm calling\nBecause I never third one bit of our politics I certainly never considered myself a conservative but the aftermath of the two thousand election changed everything for me I Believe it or not I was planning on voting for Hillary I Know that sounds crazy but uh I was facing that decision purely on how I Believe\nShe presented herself on TV during the three televised debates I thought that she represented herself more presidential he but that's stupid that's down I'm sure there's a lot of other people who did the same thing a Democrats are very good at looking polish on television\nThey have a great Albert Bell with no substance underneath a but it was it was after the election that started to realize how corrupt as one side of the media was\nAnd it was started the wheel turning in my head\nUm then seeing all the venom attack by liberal on social media to force myself and others are for daring to have a different opinion which that but really energized me to get in the fight 'em I'm now a conservative Republican through and through\nAnd I would absolutely be voting Republican in the upcoming election I've got to imagine there's there's other people more like me out there people who are getting much without politics before the election or people who are starting to have their eyes open to what is happening in our our all ready to get into the fight at this point I really believe this is a fight\nOr flight ... good versus evil you know Republicans stand for freedom in the constitution\nVersus Democrats represent hate and are working hard to take away our individual God given liberties\nNow only friend while I think you're exactly right and my best to your family I'm Sorry you had to go through that you take care of yourself [noise] M. J. Fort Lauderdale Florida Sirius satellite go right ahead please\nHigh in the ... and how you doing this evening great thank you might try like you know for a farmer um my ... I just turned fourteen to finish reading liberty and tyranny\nI just turned fourteen just finished reading liberty and tyranny and left it and he is working on um is that America healthy yeah there is a\nTough book ...\nProudly now he's great we did cut in between innings reading there Charles crack I'm a broken writing a report on it um yeah but I Am I can I just first one it I Love your show on Sundays off her it's great and I'm just wanted to say thanks for everything you do I have a bad heart but you get your keep a company oh my goodness [laughter]\nAnd looking for this book coming out my husband's a cop so I I Can't wait to the Arctic that that's great\nI wanted to ask you a question you were just talking about um people you know with the left loving women and supporting women and all that good stuff\nAnd I don't think the doctor for its\nLawyers really care about her care about women because I thought um I just kind of thought with general on a former marine cells I just got along with um General Flynn lying to the FBI maybe or didn't lie to the FBI not short\nKind of thought he was maybe getting in trouble going to jail and I thought with Martha Stewart maybe not entirely training but I'm going to maybe going to jail for ... for the FBI [noise]\nUm if if the less cares about her including the Democrats and all these people I mean it says right here Christine Ford's attorney said they haven't heard from an FBI cabinet investigation why would they want the FBI to ask one question\nIf the FBI ask one question ... something like hey do you fly on airplanes she's done she's only jail\nBut none of them but here's here's the thing to the FBI right oh I agree\nWith you but they're not doing a criminal investigation\nBut this is what judge ... doesn't understand or many other people all they're doing this is not a criminal investigation where people you know complete the this and that sort of thing what it is is they're trying to ask people about the various obligations that were made and that's it\nRight now the thing I thought in your title Eighteen\n... title Eighteen is a big title you mean a section ... thousand and one false statements yeah [noise]\nYeah I mean that's the that's possible but again they're not doing a criminal investigation they're doing a background investigation of people have different opinions and so forth [noise] they're doing a criminal investigation they would have to be issuing letters they would have to go through a completely different formalized process\nUh then they're going to know if they want to do search they'd get warrants probable cause it's none of that like\nOnly understand that if that's what they want because obviously they wanted to graduate I watched him Mitt term they don't care about the client is what I'm saying because they want to think of course the honor to drag it out but they don't care about the victim is what I was getting at\nWe know what they want but they don't want this they don't have an hour which so happy for him but I'm so happy for what's going on but I mean I Am just discuss it that we know they don't want Kavanaugh but for them to stay one justice for this victim because at the end they drag this out\nOf the the the way as you want justice for the victim you go into the Montgomery County police department and you make a complaint and see where that goes and they won't do it All right I'm Jay do get your point I Hope you feel well a given your week art I Know that feeling I've got one myself but you hang in there\nLet us go to Steve Los Angeles California eight Seventy the answer Caroline go right ahead\nMark first of all thank you for all that you do you and your partner in crime or Sean Hannity I don't know what we would do without you know you kind of touched on what I was going to bring up\nAnd maybe I Need a little more understanding common sense would dictate that they don't need the FBI does not need to talk to the judge or Dr Ford or why not for the sake of appearing enter\nInto a lot about appearances they headed limited amount of time with\nThe parents is not is not going to assuage the left is just not and so we're on the right we have to start to understand this or we constitutional is it's not about I'm a pass to find the media pacify the Democrats don't you understand they want to destroy what we believe in\nYes and so we can do twenty five FBI investigations unless there's one where they can hang our hat on it's not going to matter\nThat these are the same people who said the man is guilty of a job interview and that in the ... and the and that the er\nThe due process doesn't apply because it's a job interview does anybody really think that if it looks better if the FBI interview the two others that somehow you'll bring over Chuck Schumer Chuck Schumer is a bomb thrower\nThat's where we're up against wherever against truly diabolical individuals you're not going to be able to appease them under any circumstances probably right by\nHere's the truth about most home security companies they're like dealing with another bad cable company you spend hours waiting around for technicians hours on the phone to get questions answered and then when you're at your limit you remember you know I'm locked into a three year contract that you're looking to protect your home and\nFamily go with simply safe home security simply savers real comprehension protection beautifully designed to look good in your home simply safest backups in place to keep you safe protecting your home even if you lose power or Internet where if someone attacks\nWhich is the best of all he got twenty four seven monitoring what police and fire dispatch for just Fifteen dollars a month and unlike other home security company simply save has no long term contracts it is the best around the clock protection you can find get ten percent off simply say today at simply safe mark\nAnd none of these guys ever came out and apologize and they had expert after expert on TV telling us how you look at these facial expressions of the president hey look at the way he's flirted with words\nLook at the way he carries himself this guy's got problems right here we are two years later I tell you that this guy is a rock star in a genius and and is is bearing these guys which is very very fun to watch but anyhow\nAnd then a carrier for he carries force that doctor that he\nThat that was the one that did all this uh investigation on itself has tried to force truck to go through all the medical hoops\nAnd from that and this guy gets left and carnage as well because he came out said they didn't have all that he was very sounded very healthy right right and what I Would have bought show\nJust says it's maddening as you as your conveying as well but ah anyhow that's a bunch of people that were working with a nobody ever came I Apologize for for saying that Trump was the manager or has all that that's crazy\nAnd fiction right they're never going to apologize for it because they never will that says a hit and run bunch\nAnd hit and run bunch now they got this tax returns or from two thousand two thousand one his father's taxes somehow they stole those were somebody stole them and uh the ACLU isn't around to help the ACLU is thrown in with the uh the tournaments All right my friend thank you for your call\nLet us continue\nTo see here ah let us go to Ken Long Beach California eight Seventy the answer go\nYes mark I my question is are there any a a Senate precedents or any rules of the Senate would allow I'm Dianne Feinstein to be declared a two week we choose herself for many vote because of the alleged involvement\nWith no they would have to have a financial interest or family member I have a financial interest or something like this you know leaking and letters and so forth no first of all you have to prove it so far they haven't proven and although we all know sheer somebody associated with her did it but that's not good enough\nSecondly I assume you would need a majority of the Senate you're not going to get the Three Stooges so it'd be a sideshow\nAnd ah my my next question would be if you could give us a sort of a thumbnail sketch of what a what happened with fame Forman a Supreme Court I mean as far as voting for now ... later and I was only four person sorry\nWell if they vote for to for that means the holding in the circuit court below stance\nOkay\nAnd there's there's the favorite there is no such thing as a recess appointment for Supreme Court\nNo there could be that way I mean that would be it could have a recess appointment for court wouldn't last very long which is why they don't do it\nOh you do is you get a certain senators including Republican senators angry but uh you could do it but the goal here is a lifetime appointment not an appointment for a year or two\nThat just you know hopefully something that would be a phone in their site and\nWe need to when you mentioned we need to we need we need to stop acting like losers and be on the defense who we need to ram this through no worry about recess appointments and recusal and all the rest these people need to be crushed\nAnd so if you really want to do something you call one of the Three Stooges\nAre you'd be polite to them and civil to them and I don't have to be on the air but you should and tell them that this is very very important to you and you're going to be watching what they doing in the case of member Cal skin Collins a Jew or you take this very very seriously [noise] All right my friend thanks for your call\nFrank Philadelphia, Pennsylvania the great W. P. H. T. go\nMark thanks for taking my call mark for me I'm I'm very concerned that I don't think so under and the impact that this Kavanaugh hearings having on due process in this country and and and folks should be we should be out great\nBecause if you're a process is gone than the country's gone you have somebody who who accused\nJudge Kavanaugh of a crime and rather than the burden of proof being on the accuser which is due process the burden of proof is on the accused\nAnd not only that but now the accuser gets to determine what is\nJustified proof he has a calendar well that's not good enough all the witnesses say that that he didn't do it or he wasn't there that's not good enough we need an FBI investigation that's not good enough and then he's not even allowed to point to the inconsistencies of the accuser\nFord and all the lie that no no no you're not allowed to talk to her she's she's a victim mark if I can just go around accusing people you know mark you hate women while I have a daughter yeah but that's not good enough well I work with yeah but that's not and now it's up to you to prove to me that you don't\nDo processes done and and I don't know Kavanaugh's I mean I Want to have it ought to be voted but this is so much bigger than justice cabin all on the Supreme Court this is the country and I and I don't feel that folks really understand the impact of\nI think a lot too I really do maybe not enough and I think there's a rising tide here and you put it very very beautifully Frank very well thank you for your call we'll be right back [noise] much\nHim no\nRight to vote for Senator Kennedy for corporation commission Senator Kennedy is running for Arizona corporation commission and she is a former corporation commissioner who will lower utility range stop the corruption that the corporation commission and create more solar and renewable energy in Arizona especially rooftop solar bringing\nThousands of jobs to rule Arizona she will make Arizona the solar capital of the world and stop the corruption and that is causing unjustified utility rate increases Andrew Kennedy was the\nFirst to formally call on corruption on the commission atheist mythical wedding spent millions of dollars in dark money in the last election cycle to keep her from being elected again to the corporation commission and that tells us exactly what we need to know is Andrew Kennedy is who you need to support and if you want someone who will always stand up were you the consumer\nThe utility bills lowering vote for Senator Kennedy he's on our side\nNot the utility paid for by Kennedy twenty Eighteen month or ride like Kennedy twenty teens\nWhen you reach your retirement age sixty two older additional income could make your current financial situation worse\nWe're older additional income could make your current financial situation more stable country bangs home equity conversion mortgage commonly known as the reverse mortgage some advantages are no monthly principal and interest payments monthly income a line of credit for both plus you could lay your Social Security benefits\nCome by in the needs to cause country bank or call me I Ninety eight five eight three Ninety team for more detail equal housing lender\nMember FDIC\nGet you they send them in a movie review is up next budget by links lake cafe\nAnd can\nUse it that's like ...

one of\nThe smartest floors I Know one of the nicest people I Know as David Limbaugh and he writes great books and he's come one out right now called Jesus reason\nNow this isn't exactly my area of expertise but it's become his area of expertise he's written a lot about politics and so forth but he now has written extensively about Christianity David Limbaugh how are you my friend\nMark how are you a thank you so much for having me on\nWell it's a great pleasure in the book is as I say Jesus ribs and first of all let me ask you this you are more and more a writing you're really you become a bit of a scholar in this area of Christianity and so forth how did you come to this point\nWhen I was a young adults I wasn't really a believer I I Would always believed in God but I I didn't quite a branch of the Bible and so I really\nStarted studying it and and I had to overcome some obstacles that are over overcome some doubt and when I finally became a believer I I thought OK I'm holding in my hand the word of God with the Bible and I was\nSo in all of that so amazed that I wanted to inhale it and gobble it up and read as much as I could learn as much as I could about the Bible and theology and I I Wish that that time\nThat there were some short cut that there are some a guy some parameters that would help me get a hold of a handle on the Bible more quickly than I did it takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile work but as I\nStudy that I I I wanted to share what I learned because I was so excited about it so I tried to write a book on it and this was before I had any platform and written any columns and written any book and it didn't really go anywhere was premature but then I started writing a column and\n... and probably ten or Fifteen Years later I'd written all those columns two columns awake\nEvery week and I got five books on my belt and I thought well I have a platform I've got a little more confidence\nUh and I might just try this again so I wrote my first Christian themed book again\nExpert I explain my faith journey and why I Believe in Christianity and then from there and I've just gone on to write other books in the last one was a book about the gospel uh where I go through the gospels and explain what the text is in a kind of paraphrase it in chronological order\nAnd then uh also interspersed commentary from some of the greatest Christian thinkers\nAnd some of my own inside and I wanted to continue with the New Testament after that because I ran out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this book and it\nHas a history of the early church and checks of Paul's Thirteen of pedophiles his letters to the early churches so that's what this book is is just a continuation of\nMy a trek through the New Testament a and I got more to go and the next book of ... my publisher agrees to do it so what what the short answer your question is I was on fire but the Bible remain on fire\nThe Bible study that really pretty hard for a white person\nOr the last Twenty years on and off and I wanted to share that passion you help people where I was who are who have worked out and wanted to learn more\nAnd give them some kind of a primer and and a deep dive if they wanted to go further I Hope this book is both deep and accessible at the same time and will help people learn about the Bible and most of all inspire them to read the Bible for themselves and learn about it\nLet me ask you this question\n[noise] let me ask you this question and you look around the world\nYou see Christianity under attack even in our own country it's under attack in different ways you look at the middle east and same with Judaism you would think that the only religion that ever existed in the middle east was Islam yeah it is the third religion to exist\nAnd Christians had been pushed out of most of the Arab countries obviously there are individuals who want to push the Jews of sort of Jerusalem in Israel but when you look at our own country talk about the Supreme Court and the courts generally there is a growing hostility\nTowards Christianity the sink your book will help people better understand that they don't have to be afraid of your face to face\nYou know that is such a good question I I really believe that the Judeo Christian tradition is at the bedrock of our constitutional principles I realized there's and white and that influences and Judeo Christian principle behind the constitution and our liberties\nAnd what our tradition stance for the Christian Church tradition stands for freedom we believe were made in God's image ... where we have these innate rights ... writes that come from God that comes from our religious tradition\nAnd ... as a result of really believing that from the core of ourselves that we all men are entitled to that freedom we by definition do not want to suppress the freedom and liberty anyone else their religious or political liberty and that includes people whose views are in that the U.S\nThere for the last in response to your question has nothing to fear for it for much atheists have nothing to fear from about Islam as long as it does an attack us at nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the the ... the the totalitarian the authoritarians a suppressor of free speech and liberty\nCome from the left and we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by while the secular laugh destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroys those sacred values that\nThat underlying honor guard all of our freedoms are and we can't just as some Christian pastor Christian suggests we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth but he passed it by standard\nWe need to be active and there's nothing\nIncompatible between Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance\nWith our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the last as hard as they buy that we don't want to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and isn't chance and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear from what we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do it as if they had the power\n[noise] the book is Jesus is risen it's by David Limbaugh or you can get it at Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already ... show Facebook mark ... we have a link to it it is really a fascinating and um\nAnd went into the er the audience little interesting discussion you and I had when I said I don't want you to come on and discuss your book and David is so respectful of other face and other beliefs than other people he said well\nAre you really short because you know I'm I'm Talking about Jesus and you know and you're Jewish and so forth [noise]\nAnd I said I get it it's okay I Want you to come on my show I Want you to talk about that I'll tell you why David\nAnd we're going to come back in thirty seconds\nI say more vibrant some more rigorous people are in the Christian faith\nSit better society is I feel the same way about my own religion Judaism\nAnd so let's discuss that a little bit when we come back we'll be right back\nDust pollen we spend most of our time indoors so why believe in the outdoors when you're inside kill with over six hundred scientists to choose from plus cost him options we have a solution to make your indoor air cleaner pressure and well better\nThey're manufactured right here in America I'm Free within twenty four hours and you can sign up for a subscription thing never have to think about air filters ever again\nYou don't want to mess with the IRS you have the power to garnish your paycheck about your bank accounts and even take your home or business that's all true but thankfully they're offering a way out a fresh start initiative\nIf you qualify you save your thousands the experts at much actually both fight to get you the best possible tax settlement and I am in a rating with a better Business Bureau to prove they called optimal for your free consultation\nBut we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to something that's a math to our founding principles and we watch the totalitarian tendency the left as Obama\nClarion tendency the left as Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation and nothing like it appeared\nAt the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his son a mental transformation was not a restoration of where we started about a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction of our founding principles in my view\nNow again not [laughter] I won't say I'm an expert on this subject won't even say I'm close to that but the way you're dividing your writings on this and you kind of touched on at the beginning is how is how and then where do you go from here\n[noise] okay well I Am\nA again wanting to\nComplete my Journey Through the New Testament I'd already written so I'm On the Old Testament and I want to help readers really understand the Bible so these this and I want to give them a historical perspective and so the book of acts as the early church the history of the early church really happened in history these are real people\nAnd and I wrote and I and I included the book of acts as I say which is the history of the early church\nAnd then six of the apostle Paul Thirteen of pills he writes these forms the Iraqis letters to the churches after he had planted these churches throughout the Roman empire and they're falling away from the religion they're falling prey\nTo the secular influence is just like we see today the secular influence as a pagan city of corn which was dominated by a sexual immorality and I doubt trade from me mainly feature of the the love God it's after ...\nAnd Paul would write to these churches in such a personal and intimate way saying look I've formed you as I Would birth a baby and I told you the truth\nGospel and here you are deviating listened to be listening to these pagan influences and following year last full desires and he told them what they needed to do to get back on course not follow the false teachers but remember what he told them when he was there and then he gives them instruction on\nPractice a Christian living at a live right\nNow to be good and moral people most of the Holy Spirit of a bay the Holy Spirit\nAnd then and then continue to do what is right and he also expanded on the doctrine of Christian doctor and what's interesting mark is this really happened in history and I want to give readers a sense of that history because\nWhen when they when they read it they will understand it really happening although Paul wrote these letters to a particular church and\nHe didn't know that though they were inspired by God they would be a political to all of us for the next two thousand or however many years the world exist so they're of universal application to all churches and all the people who read these letters even though they were written to individual people\nAt a specific point in time in history we've still profit from them today as a Christian wave their holy scripture the New Testament they become part of the New Testament and God's word in our view\nSo it's just wrong miraculous how this was a card and people can really profit from these from these words which we believe are God's work so I Want to help all my book is not\nA God's word it's a book about gods were trying to sell it they people's understanding advance their learning curve reduced or intimidation about the Bible and most of all it as I said again inspire them to read it and gobble it up like I've tried to do the last Twenty years\nWell you're very much the renaissance man the subjects that you've written about over the years really are um [noise] a very well they cover a lot of territory and this is this is an area I Know that is very very important to you and true to you and you dedicate the book\nTell everybody that this is to Christian and Sam who who are they\nAre criticized my oldest daughter and Sam is or who has been and they got married a month or so ago and you blessed us with your your and your wife and I am so grateful and your so gracious to everyone there I Love you know\nAnd I let me tell you that was a beautiful beautiful of and a beautiful marriage\nAnd are they coming together to wonderful families and we wish them and
