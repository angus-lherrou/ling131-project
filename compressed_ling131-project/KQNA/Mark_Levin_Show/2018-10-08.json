the kind of people\nThat you want to be spending some quality time with\nMa'am what your doubts having a life today that was going on the uh paid protesters there a\nHeckling uh and then harassing Joe Manchin who is that yes Joe Manchin the Republican and waiting I Wonder if that is going to happen to have no idea but there Joe Manchin of course has been the most moderate Democrat in the Senate mentioned after being twenty sixteen election but he wouldn't consider consider the up or what\nThe governor the Democratic governor of West Virginia ...\nSo the question is uh is mentioned that maybe he wins reelection ... and he goes to add an end up let me think but uh I was mentioning in the previous segment\nThat there is the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norm don't apply\nDonald Trump being president of the United states not your typical president and\nThe movement that he learned twenty sixteen not your typical movement\nWhich has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat could certainly aid the argument that we're in bits inflection point that things are different this is not your typical midterm election cycle\nTo provide a a little more\nOh midterm election cycle\nTo provide a a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it\nAnd I've never seen and again I'm a student of history and I'm a student of information\nAnd to the point at which began in the Nineteen thirties\nInformation about what we've been interested in what we've been into or mid term elections since the late Nineteen thirties right\nNever once not ever\nAs the most important issue to the average voter ... in\nThe United States Supreme court\nIt's come up with really high in presidential elections it was the number three as you and election day every three issue an election day twenty six thing\nBut it's number one\nNumber one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind\nHowever their impassioned do vote\nWe are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change cabin I'll get confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe people are still that motivated by because hey we have other Supreme Court justices that come up here over the next couple of years right\nWell we are seeing right now\nAnd some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before\nYou have the Supreme Court I mentioned and then it goes to health care\nOK so after that a which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time\nAnd anytime that politics that people\nThe outcomes absolutely have the potential to be too\nSo as we are\nNow just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent\nAnd that is the potential\nFor what could happen\nIf there were a red wave that came out of this\nIf you had seven percent\nThat moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress or maybe because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh you'll wind seven percent\nI mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh process entire process from the day after he was nominated\nUntil today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom\nIn terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here\nThose are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country\nUsually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and what you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of an environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote\nBut you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history\nAnd you get out there and you're trying to make a difference\nBecause we do have a different landscape it's not all they are and the point and then in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away\nSo that is what you're in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined\nAngry people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe mansion it's going to winning hearts and minds when it's I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd uh by the way I Want to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely definitely should go ahead and hit on your DVR\nIf you don't already haven't life liberty and living in sin eastern Fox News channel Sunday night\nGoing to talk about the media and one

depicted what happened at the time of the nomination\n... issue detailed in chronicled ... every everything that she thought ran afoul and I don't know that she would have had that level of detail if she were just trying to rally here in the eleventh hour to try to save face for the moderates in the Senate\nI got the sense that what took place today was truly principal and and really was something that she was that series about every step of the way and and throughout the process including as you pointed out with all of her other previous boats so\nI I hear what you're saying but I'm just not in on the conspiracy thought process that Susan Collins he was not on the up and not by I really I got the sense that uh she was in the air and genuine around her speech let's go to Raj Raj is in Virginia Welcome to the show\nHello Hank to so much I Do appreciate you have any strong emphasis on then fiction points I Believe the on at that point but not just in the political lady now even the financially you know even the heck did he know\nThat they will change the culture is increasing and those are all the trends and I'm looking at a strong herded wave\nOn the other point to mention

not an engineer though not by a long shot I came and change a tire effectively just asked my dad about that one\n[laughter]\n[laughter] that was one of the moments where I ... my background is in financial analysis and business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years love what I Do\nUh but uh but the kind of want to be a little paths that way and uh what I ended ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in very different algorithms and in formulas\nAnd figuring out that hey if we have history we have the information we can do a lot of different things in in life with them or beyond just the financial markets for example so anyway ah good stuff pretty she had Raj\nLet's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\nGood afternoon you know the two things that that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was in motion ally disturbed\nAnd there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously so sexual molestation but what\nWe felt pity we didn't show anger I have no Adam is towards the woman but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the\nDebauchery that to the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to prevent something that was normal\nWithin you know the process of the government and there should be some re complaints from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animals towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted\nThis is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalty not necessarily innocent victims like Dr Ford who I really think she is\nBut the people who are behind that and directing it and in corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people are going to be punished\nI'm going to agree with all agree with Seventy five percent of your point you're I I Do want to ask you specifically you'd say that uh you're not angry at at Christine forward here\nDo you feel that uh she did anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nWell here's what we don't know we don't know what was said in her um sessions for therapy sessions I don't know that some therapists or some lawyer may have talk her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable\nMemories can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I\nI don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that I can see that she was used by people who didn't know enough I mean if it was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein whether bothers out day one\nShe knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that the ... way to the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it and putting the attorneys who hated to begin with and in charge of it\nShe knew that was another lose situation\n... well it is the boy did she calculate wrong\nIt's interesting now you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting point I still can't get there in in terms of having necessarily been ... into this mindset remember she's a professional in the field\nI I mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored in and memories are stored in the hippocampus was that they only won by the way when she pulled out and went seriously this is how you're attempting to establish your credibility as a witness was one of those moments where it's like okay [laughter]\nYou know one of the bird tactic is there\nA but but anyway um you know I I still feel she's kind of a ... you go under oath you're you're involved in this process you say you're one hundred percent certain you provide all these witnesses and the thing that's odd to if she was going to end up being co worst by you know it's I'm a psychologist that these are the memories that you really had\nWhere was she of received all the names but she provided as the witnesses I mean that's difficult for somebody who was a third party that wouldn't have been involved in that process to do\nOr party that wouldn't have been involved in that process to to instill in her I just can't quite get there but otherwise very compelling and are interesting thought All right I Am Brian mud in for the great one\nMonth over him\nNo\nNo it's not smart job sites it overwhelm you with

absolutely\nViscerally important it is to Americans that we enforce our borders that we enforce the rule of law we cannot be a nation of laws with its own sovereignty if we don't have a strong border and to that point that the the crazy\nDemocrat\nOn the Pima County board of supervisors in my district refused the money from the federal government\nTo a a shore up a border security\nUh where they are was just absolutely reprehensible if I'm not mistaken they took the same oath of office that I did to support and defend the constitution of the United states against all enemies\nForeign and

not be able to charge taxes on services now there isn't a substantive conversation our dialogue or debate occurring at the legislature elsewhere about implementing a tax\nOn services but I Believe that this is a preemptive theory and um you know looking into the future trying to ensure that there isn't a tax cut on services\nSo the original discussion at the legislature and I notice who's loses
