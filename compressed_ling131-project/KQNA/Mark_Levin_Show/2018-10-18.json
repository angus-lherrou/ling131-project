Elder dot com an article for the national review it's called the Christian man receives justice and it's about the former Atlanta fire chief name Kelvin Cochran I've been telling you about him for the last few days because he was represented by alliance defending freedom\nI mean we do some of this article by David French National Review quote in a groundbreaking when for religious liberty former fire chief Calvin Cochran has reached a one point two million dollar settlement with the city of Atlanta\nYesterday my friend and former colleagues at the alliance defending freedom announced that former Atlanta fire chief Cochran had received a one point two million dollars to have them in any case he brought effort of city fired him for writing and distributing to a few select for the employees a self published book that articulated in entirely orthodox Christian view\nOf sex in marriage\nAnd Cochran was a pioneer born in Confederate Memorial Hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana happens to be black grew up to be\nOne of the first black firefighters in his hometown fire department ultimately became the first black fire chief which report Obama appointed him to run the fireman is race in the division of the federal the division of FEMA\nAfter he left the Atlanta fire department\nWhich he went to after report the fire department struggle the Atlanta mayor asking to come back you turn the department around\nYou know on his own time he's received permission from the city's ethics officer to self publish a Christian book the book is called who told you that you are naked\nIt argues in part that fact outside of marriage between a man and a woman country too will of God and of course takes a position that opposite sex marriage also contrary to the will of God\nHe's tribute to book to a few select colleagues mainly people who already discussed the Christian faith with him he also shared with the mayor three members of the city council no fire department employee ever complain to him about the book one employee did show a few pages of the book that dealt with sexuality to an openly gay Atlanta city council member\nThat led to Cochran being suspended without pay that led to the mayor and the city firing him without providing them due process\nShe was represented by alliance defending freedom the organization that I've been raising money for for the past two and a half weeks and I'm asking you one more time to please help out chief Cochran prevailed if its foreign could happen in the Bible belt in the south that could happen anywhere from two alliance defending freedom counsel David Cortland\nI Do I see more challenges out in the in the future and I think the reason for that is and it's quite ironic it happened in the chiefs case and then all of these other cases\nYou know we hear so much today about tolerance and inclusive be a it was the exact reason that the city of Atlanta gave for firing the chief and it's quite ironic to say that we're being inclusive intolerant I\nAnd it's quite ironic that we're being inclusive and tolerant by firing someone who disagrees with artificial views that that's what actually happened\nNow alliance defending freedom represented a chief Cochran\nFor free to him but the cost of litigating something like this especially cases like jak Philips the owner of the ... where in his case when all the way up to the Supreme Court\nIt can be very expensive so please help us consortium of lawyers were defending people whose religious rights are under attack please call eight six six four three five two to
