thirty different things\nAnd people always over simplify it is part of the reason by the way you have a lot of folks that get Florida elections wrong because you'll have some of these are pollsters oriental is out there\nWho will say you know hey nationally Hispanics break X percent for Democrats and they see that hey we have a very large Hispanic contingent in Florida\nAnd then you go all those people are going to pray for Democrats at this present well hold on hold on for just a minute you have to figure out all the different interests and all the various different groups that are here all the Caribbean islands that are represented\nMexico yes do you do have south and Central America does alter represented one of the things that I found to be most interesting kind of like a Isaac was indicating there you're on DACA\nFor many on the right\nThere are stereotypes and assumptions for example and someone's here on DACA ... they probably are an Obama type a Democrat is they don't like Donald Trump right\nWell no not necessarily a big misconception that white kind of like hey you know X number of Hispanics will break this way regardless of where they're from or what their interests are you've got to get to know the people and I've found far more often than not\nThat people who really saw how the United states true immigrants bell wanted a better life overwhelmingly overwhelmingly are more conservative than not certainly socially more conservative than they did Democrats had been in a very long time\nBut even in terms of economics I mentioned earlier this hour\nYou have a lot of the younger folks have millennials for example are starting to have their eyes open to why this economy can do one thing the United states economy is capable of they didn't know before because they became adults\nDuring the recession and then\nThe Obama economy so now they're just starting to go wow you know things can be different\nI've seen it even around radio you were with some folks that have been here over the years like wow you know really can't get better yeah get you can same deal with a lot of Hispanics\nA lot of different backgrounds\nA lot of folks want a better life if they can obtain that they're going to one more of that and so what we've actually been seen increasingly\n... is a trend towards them\nTwo of the most watched districts in the country did a a BBC special on the midterm elections they wanted to highlight six different regions of the country and the tops of elections\nAds the case may be in South Florida here we have the two most heavily democratic districts currently represented by Republicans in the United States House districts twenty six and twenty seven in Florida\nAnd district twenty six\nYou had Hillary Clinton win in that district in twenty sixteen\nMy sixteen points\nBut you had Carlos Curbelo the curtain representative who's a Republican\nWin by five or six points\nYou know how does that happen\nThat one happened in other parts of the country right\nI mean be did there too many people which is both the ticket if you're ... or Hillary Clinton how could you vote for any Republican\nCongressionally\nAgain when I was just mentioning\nNot as a\nConventional as the not so ... a conventional wisdom or or why use thought\nWould have you think there's a lot more to the store and we started talking about Hispanics and immigrants do want a better life\nAnd district twenty seven\nHillary Clinton had been one that district by twenty points\nWhen he points and you had the retiring Ileana Ross lightened when that district by ten\nI think that's the difference here and that's why it's important\nTo break the odds with these stereotypes to really understand some of the dynamics many votes do not support the left in what they've been doing from the immigration stance or in in many folks that are here on DACA got a disproportionate number in in South Florida I've talked to a lot of them over the years\nThey might surprise you politically so anyway you just a little food for thought as we're three weeks away from election day let's go to Ryan who wants to take

liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota and\nOh I'm a liberal\nI I Am not liberal I have always been on both sides of this that and and honestly with the tenth and sounding egotistical you hit on somebody called me back and not you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short\nA very quickly I didn't vote for a model I uh I'm I'm probably believe in gay rights I grow and believe in freedom of religion I fully believe that a woman's right to a woman's right to to\n'em all down the line I but I have always been I've never been calm to what anybody tells me without my own thought process behind it good and so I Am the am I Am at moderate\nThat everybody wanted me over and the other side\nI mean you know I couldn't do it is very social liberal values However I'm off on this thing is most of my adult life and I voted for her time thing here because yeah you want to be I didn't have to pay for it\nBut I'm going on and and watching\nThe ... thing and yes I'm a pet but you're not making a bigger deal over that Heidi Heitkamp breaking campaign ad that just came out and in North Dakota because that is I I did I mention I'm all for it I Am a crew had it was the take them with documentation Mm well I'm Sorry I\nHave a moderate but everybody wants to pour over unfortunately at this point I'm going to carry a trade off\nIf my kid I don't care who go back fifty years of my kids have to hit on a table and get into a you know a book to job aboard ten or ... they hopped around bath and starting to get it again and put my friends in a camp\nI Am all for it puts out right ... right wing guy in there and do that point I feel I have a better than\nUm converting them over and Mike Quill value booming we hear everything we can go to get everything gets fed\nSeeking that they were coming from a crowded party and what they only\nHave my family knew me why they may have ... the main thing I mean I'm In my eyes the as my idea is that I Believe that\nWell then you are you raise a number of interesting points and it sounds like you have been very much politically involved in the bowl lean over a long window of time\nYou are not a typical for all a lot of likely Trump voters and even is typical because I'm\nNot sure if they don't let the Asian between conservatives versus Republicans versus moderate it's really hard anymore with labels but what I Will say and I say there's a lot with especially younger\nRepublican ask voters\nWhen you're basically describing is that you are a social liberal but fiscally conservative and ultimately it's how do you want your government to be run\nIn the grand scheme of things if we're talking about the values that you just represented as Donald Trump\nLikely to strip the any of those potential rights\n... from any of the the aforementioned no\nIs Donald Trump going to be the guy to to try to to push for the elimination of of gay marriage now he's not for that matter he's even told justice to stand down when it comes to marijuana enforcement you know there he's not the most conservative guy I mean take a look at his own personal life it tells you as much\nSo you do have a lot of fiscal conservatism I'll give you an idea you know I'm I'm a little bit of a quandary\nPolitically myself I you know don't generally talk about it quite this way but I\nPersonally am quite conservative and when it comes to social values I live my life as kind of like a half at Catholic and if I said I was a good Catholic wouldn't be throws all want to be honest [laughter] so I got to have as Catholic but I you know I had here too that that kind of value system for so for example you know personally I'm pro life\nI Believe in a libertarian form of government so when it comes to social issues I Am more inclined to get the government the way for example I don't think the government should be involved at all and marriage why is it that the government dictates marriage why is it that the tax code has ever delineated\nBased upon one marital status we've created so many issues so many issues that way\nThey didn't have to be created because we put government into the mix\nSo I Am inclined or you know it's like with marijuana a lot of people think that uh you know because I I Will rail against it like we have ... you know medical marijuana legalized in Florida which a lot of states do and you have the recreational use in several more states oh rail against it and and people are just anti marijuana what no I'm not\nI don't care if you smoke your crap as long as you keep it away from me and don't hurt anybody my issue is that it's not legal you know I I Believe again in the premise and so in the case of something like marijuana well\nIt needs to be either legalize rather minimum decriminalized by the federal government otherwise all we're doing and all these states\nLike mine is I mean our nose of the United States Constitution it doesn't work that way and that's the reason that we got all this kind of horse crap stuff going on where you can use the financial system and it creates a whole host of problems under that you have doctors that will go\nYou know given like a Lincoln and not because you can actually is you a prescription because oh by the way you're trying to issue guidance on a schedule one drug\nSo again that is I I think where you're coming from more of a position that is prevalent within a Trump supporter but even maybe even a young younger uh is the Republican ask again butters for the lack of a better label and certainly I think people who are constitutional it's\nSo anyway ah my my heart goes out to you for having been the victim but to you and your family a endemic are blessed\nBy the way for Heitkamp in North Dakota I mean come on\nThe high camp in North Dakota ... you're you're talking about\nA state that Trump won by thirty six points and her she's voted with Donald Trump the approximately forty percent of the time I Am in ... doesn't exactly line up with\nThe north Dakota and die use\nI mean I I don't know what Taylor Swift suicide but it's like\nI'm

Bush because he's become an issue in the campaign a\nMyth McCaskill you were quoted a ... it's\nJust like you know that these guys role like that and it's not Donald Trump George W.
