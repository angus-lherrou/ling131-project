if you're accused of something show the evidence you cannot just say to somebody you know I was sexually assaulted or you did that to me because sometimes she said to me he goes too far and the way

what so are we there was absolutely a press\nThat went down in the way you would think actually a meeting between the president on your Web browser by the way it was said uh blocks really like you get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry is comment to a white police brutality is to release the love\nAnd he said that there should be in Chicago easy id Asian centers that's\nEasy which is a the namesake of has a a need a savior he said that the law that sentiment is what gave him the balls to go for it and make so much money when the genus I'm just\nStunned across the board you\nKnow we're gonna have a thought they were going to have a conversation which we would follow up on 'em in bars on criminal justice reform sentencing in prisons which is by the way a bipartisan really important idea of there was that was mostly nonsense\nThat was mostly nonsense has that man\nA black man was conservative\n\nAnd that was an assault on our White House\nImmediately after county where us in the oval office wow\nThat was bonkers if you thought you were going to get a thoughtful way by playing political announces you're not when we knew that that you guys MSNBC group because that was an assault on our White House\nYou can't analyze some of that stuff that was crazy thank you for that thought for now it's as to what you promised as you were not going to give us Shawna\nYou

incredibly proud of Kanye West\nHe's speaking for the people like myself who are the the super silent majority right I mean there is like\nThe eight percent of us or something crazy and and I think that there's more out there and I think that we're winning we're actually winning that's why the left is going ... that's why the the mainstream media's going bunkers as they called him\nBecause they know that if we get just a few percentage points more of the black vote it's over ... it doesn't matter ... they can say whatever they want to say they can keep pushing that that racist talking point that the Republicans are racist but\nPeople like myself are waking up and I'll tell you something bad I'm thirty three years old I was born and raised a lifelong Democrat\nI was a liberal I was an idiot okay I ate up all of that crap\nThat they fed me my whole life which was that you know I couldn't get ahead that I Would never be treated equally I've never felt more or less than when I went to south haven Mississippi and I went to a Trump rally and I wore that make America great again hat and I totally\nYou're only going to bring home now you you need to go to a mental hospital you need to go to a mental hospital run away\nRight well I'll tell you what you know what a mental hospital is better than the Democrats plantation and you know what they look how quickly they turn on you when you don't agree with what they say and the sad thing about it is is that the car sellers what's really sad is he's ...\nHe's the person that they put up there to lie to all of us are there but oh\nOh I Know I think I think he's a leader in the Democratic party because he's able to marginalize into black people that they can't\nYou can't disagree with the Democratic party or you are going to be an Uncle Tom and if you're not going to be accepted in your community is you're not going to be accepted in your church and we're going to accept the your neighborhoods\nBut Ben I'm Talking to more and more black people and getting\nOut there and I'm saying things that I'm Talking to people and people are starting to wake up it little by little and you kinda have to produce them and ask them questions and things like that but people are starting to say Trump not that bad he's not the races that people keep lying and saying that he is\nDo you want to you or I don't look at the you ought to look at it that that's just my I was growing down my Twitter feed right now are people that are listening to the show tonight who were telling me that they actually believe that Kanye West should be in a mental hospital\n... mental health shaming someone the day I and world mental health day when Democrats telling me they care about mental health you should never shame any by just shame someone and use mental health to shame a person\nThey have no clothes I have no children you\nKnow what and and it's okay if they do it it's okay if they do it but if we split up and we say one thing that they're going to crucify of twenty four seven on and it's sad it's sad because uh you know they run the media\nThey really do we have a few people like yourself and the and Merkel it in\nThat you know are are telling the truth but for the most part you know they're they're bought and paid and they're on their and their brainwashing people twenty four hours a day and in fact the matter is look at the black community all you have to deal with open your eyes to see I live in Memphis, Tennessee run by Democrats and from that\nAnd you go to every single Democrat city black people have got to wake up they don't wake up and see well it'd be a reason for us to continue to vote for one party and makes no sense on planet earth when that party has done nothing for your school system is done nothing for the prison system it's done nothing for\nFather's the lack of fathers and the home the welfare state and and people are going to eventually wake up and they'll look around and say that the party has never done anything for me\nWhen I did that I'll tell you something then it changed my entire life at the moment I was reading pill\nAnd watch a show and I think you great to talk to you you know you're talking about unhinged um since I got an article who's going to be earlier says you and your dog can now pee all over Donald Trump thinks two statues shut up in Brooklyn\nOr age or the boss of

streets in Brooklyn so that\nYou can have your dog pee on Donald Trump I don't know what is on edge\nI really don't\nBut it's just it's this is the new normal happy you are on the mark of ensure been

in response to the praise Donald Trump gave him at the White House again her exact words hashtags Kanye West and set us back a hundred and fifty five years\nI'm wish Sojourner Truth could have met him

president of the United states\nYou're able to go and sit down and have a conversation with them and that's what he's trying to do he's trying to sit down and have a conversation and change things for
