certain amount of power but the gun you feel\nLike God da ... said he is smart cookie [laughter]\nYou can also see him going you know what the president said I can speak for many time\nThat that could be entertaining and has a book agents will see where that story and\nA a story that I\nBelieve it is still being discussed one that has been long perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we were just talking about\nBut the minimum wage\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time has been the need for the minimum\nOf die but it's been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government male\nRecently we have the Amazon dot com and Greece to Fifteen dollars per hour which in and of itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built a better mouse trap but I mean the ... or so you want to talk about the ... the on the left and it was no balance\nRemember a while it's about a time Wal Mart was the goal in the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and and kill him ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses and then they were up putting a bunch of people on minimum wage right a plus at Walmart\nThere from uh from\nRepublican places aren't they yeah they do is be so I mean for all those reasons when Wal Mart was just a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com they happen to be greater than ... of Wal Mart yes\nYes the Amazon is three hundred percent\nHe dies and market capitalization a ball markets by the left\nBut again you know I don't begrudge them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress where Amazon goes to fit and then you hear the the folks go everybody should take Amazon model now I Will point out some of the obvious here\nFor people to understand that get on the other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a little more to business there were getting crushed by Amazon study ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon ice scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering\nA ... they are killing the profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up dead and dying as we speak now\nThan not withstanding\nThe number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually ... and\nIronically not the last time it was a really big issue it got to like coming off the Occupy\nIn the twenty fourteen midterm elections I happen to be about that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what\nA lot of folks in the country had a point because they did kind of\nYou know four years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth\nWe never even got close to an average US Economy\nSo yeah okay but\nEven then what percentage of people earn\nBack in twenty fourteen you'd think earned minimum wage ready\nEven in Morocco Obama's got to make one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and I happen to be working part time\nJob and people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was them and we've got three and a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people and how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics ... percent\nPoint six percent that zero\nZero point six percent\nNow what's more is Ninety nine percent of those people\nBe point six percent\nAre under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as those wages we got the minimum wage conversation come up again\nAh one of the great frauds perpetuated that's out there is still living wage having\nEconomics Amazon dot com profits prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages like what we're seeing because here's another little factoids oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's making\nOur we finally\nJust about three percent towards a wage growth\nBy the time you Adam bonus just go over that by the time you add in your tax cuts\nChurns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average Jeanette take home pay\nNow a six point seven over a year\nYou have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good so\nFunny what happens we actually have a good economy you I don't have any weights\nAnd I was just a bunch of BS [noise]\nSuicides authorities one set

States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway\nBut the biggest beneficiary\nIs you the employee\nBut [noise]\nYou know I I guess conveniently that that message has just been missed it I'm sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story\nInteresting how even NBC was one of their news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just everything\nAll right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nOr are we doing all good [laughter] well\nI see it as kind of a two car problem really I mean you get a single payer healthcare system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospitals envious of the smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it out because they can't cut the cost that the government wants to cut them down to for a lot of this stuff\nThat's the first part I see\nThe second part I see is we need to adjust something in the hospital you know what it costs the manufacture of one thousand cc bag of fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know a dollar I I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital and a lot more than ... hundred dollars\nWell and and so Ross and I appreciate the ... you have a in a good point by the a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about insurance generally the biggest problem and affordability and health care is health insurance\nProblem is we have been raised the idea that health insurance equal healthcare that's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare\nHas been the lack of people that could afford health care with health insurance it sounds according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interests\nBut here's what they found in their research\nThere are forty two million Americans for two million have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars\nNow is you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring that but that's the only an average cost of health insurance right now so would you be better off\nEighty five hundred dollars you could use on health care or when you'd be better off if eighty five hundred dollars went for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plan which you can hit which is why people can't afford healthcare\nIt's all part of the financial fraud\nThe number one way to get to more affordable health care is to break the back\nOf the insurance first model having embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time of day\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most back crap crazy thing I've ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility\nBeing handed a piece of paper\nThat says in so many words about what ever happened in that facility\nWhich you have no clue and generally yet what that's going to be\nIn whatever it happens to cost\nWhich generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for\nOnce they also can't tell you\nYou will Magid walking into a store\nBuilding a car with stuff\nNot having a clue what any of it costs\nAnd signing a piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this\nCrazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to weigh the way we use insurance for everything else in her life how is that well\nWhat do we do if we have a mechanical problem with our car\nWhile we we'd go pay and habits and asked\nIf we get in a big time accident we follow the insurance claims\nWere already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans\nCan't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nSo why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plan the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying is the worst thing\nThat's essentially what they are as catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop\nOh we got to find the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else it is both sat there and we'll take a look at best deal boom done\nWell with health care we never have a shot\nWe never have a shot at doing it one of the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look at any time we have research that will show the costs of a procedure from one place to the next\nUm I had a I had a minor surgery years ago\nI gone through my insurance\nWould have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars\nTo the point there\nWe never know\nBecause we sign pieces of paper those as something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can\nIs not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that it's that insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans\nWill consider the
