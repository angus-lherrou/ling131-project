issues but no one no one should do what I Am about to play for you know one should stoop to this level no one\nShould take advantage wild wild ... and this started while the bodies were still on the floor of that synagogue that started I ... you could see it on social media it was there it was an opportunistic it was eggs or criminal behavior\nAnd um and it was typical typical\nAnd um and it was typical typical of today's left it starts\nWith California Congressman Adam Schiff\nOn CNN's State of the union\nNo one set the tone more than president United States and the tone that he says wind up division off in one of hatred\nAnd this is now becoming a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nHoward Dean really\nThat's a man with the flames of his hatred where fans by a president who kept talking about this caravan of refugees have favorite Harris\nI'm this is a um [noise] this is a triangulation a lot of people that are making this this is sort of doubling down on not just intellectual dishonesty but but just disgusting levels of scapegoating vats the\nPittsburgh synagogue shooter was somehow spurred to action\nBy the president's warnings\nThe thousands of people who are headed our way\nIn order to intentionally violate\nThat a president who is vigilant about that\nYou somehow set the stage\nFor this kind of a reaction I mean how low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is then why is the author\nTraining I mean why is the author very very first\nThing that the president didn't condemn the attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing in the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous [laughter]\nActs you can't start putting the responsibility of the individual on anybody but the individual who carried out the crime is delivered on the promises he made and if anything I think that uh and divisive the way that every single thing that comes out of the media and Ninety percent of what comes out of the media is now isn't negative about this president\nAmen amen and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged out\nAs you hear a word for word and page after page in speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet about our level of discourse in civility is all kinds of dashed against the rocks and observation that you certainly can make\nIs it because Trump won or because of what Trump tweet or because of some sharp old bowed a soul the thing that he might have said it some rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid\nReason our discourse has been dragged into the muck is the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle\nThat he won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive and the business is nothing new but the level of hatred that's all you know the change is real by the way the level of vitriol the level of venom\nWhen you have an entire dominant media culture walking around saying the president is racist the president is a hater\nHow how in the world that how do you think Thanksgiving is going to be a good idea I think your Facebook exchanges are going to go so All right Mark Davis into Larry Elder more than a moment and right on to the phones will you eight nine seven one stage stick
