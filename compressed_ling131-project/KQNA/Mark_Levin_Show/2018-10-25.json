make this happen\nYour turn to join the campaign we need your help by calling this phone number\nIt's eight six six four three five twenty to fifty to where you can go to Larry Elder dot com and click on the ATF ban or they're not every gift today doubles so your generous donation will go even farther\nThanks to a generous match from eight from in the ATF benefactor so this is the right time to

an issue that you care about more than any other that most Americans do anyway one that's hitting the pocket books of American families are the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in a recent poll conducted by Frank Luntz\nHe got an earful on this words like greed gouging an unfair kept coming up and a lot of questions why does the cost of drugs keep skyrocketing why of the cost of the top ten medications increased over one hundred percent since ... eleven why does the whole system feel rigged\nThere is an answer the big drug maker spend a lot of money lobbying to protect their profits over one hundred Seventy one million dollars to be exact\nBut there is a bigger lobby in America our politicians must answer to we the people and we want solutions to prescription drug affordability and we want them now it's time to hold drug makers accountable and put patients at a profit they ... they have their lobbyists\nAnd there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories that are votes it's time to end the drug maker monopoly pricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all the ... parents ahead of profits enough is enough citizens for truth in drug pricing\nShare something with your ... the conversation I had this morning that I was reporting for us stepping in rural of MSNBC um there's about another forty seconds of it and you did not get to hear that I wanted to do to you to hear the end of the conversation because as you can see\nIt was rather um eventful uh she she is insisted that the president of the United states is dog whistling has always been dog whistling\nUh in order to reach his base of white nationalist when he said he's a nationalist I explained very clearly that no he was comparing nationalism to global as a matter of fact I Wish I'd had this queued up or I Would have played this at the time but you do remember this one the president pulled out of the Paris climate accord right\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not parents you know what that means that's nationalism\nRepresenting the people at the United states first not the people of the world's first that's what nationalism is what does that have to do with white nationalism what does it have to do with anything having to do with race but that's what the left tries to do is I Want you to ... to go back here just a little bit\nWe play a little bit of this stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the thing for the shot and then what your reactions eight eight eight nine seven months age\nEight eight eight nine seven ... seven to for three give us all is that the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston\nVery clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism\nNot comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second a nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree\nGiven the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on your mark right so we're going to agree to that what we're\nSaying well yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouth and I feel like that's caused it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back many medical at president has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay well what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable his you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you're you're you know Bloomberg TV a editor as well you're a former anyway you you know you still given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism\nIn were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're gonna stop other countries and taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if\nTaking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better deal out of the market is that right now is not an object nationalist but is that not economic nationalism is my question\nNot if you look at the way the president of south that gives you the truth sits\nAt an impasse he would engage in saying like GTC point out and partner with our allies\nThat have been kept saying Seventy rule thank you for coming on with Russia China cheers on Sunday that live at the top of\nThat music it'd be on there of course was the end of the top of a interview that I did with a Seventy world this morning so that was a replay of this morning's conversation that I had there and I'm waiting for that and\nUm but what I Want to get to and I want you to respond to is this an eight eight eight nine seven on stage\nUm she said she's not putting words in the president's mouth but she is doing exactly that\nShe is saying that the president is talking about white nationalism the president said globalism nationalism global let's put the world's first in our country second national put our country first and the rest of the world's second I'm a nationalist she entered my costs", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "25"}
