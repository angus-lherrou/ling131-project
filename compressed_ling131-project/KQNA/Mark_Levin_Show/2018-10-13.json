of the\nSeventies was cutting a yesterday but the the president actually has been doing something that has been a little bit beyond the radar but really is important and he's been really pain in the clear picture about a number of issues most recently Medicare\nFor all male last week we're talking about the\nHonesty that the president put on Christine for comments without rant that he did during the rally when he pointed out safely\nHow she seemed to remember nothing except that it was Brett Kavanaugh and that she had one beer\nOh but you can't tell you those things sure you can because she was in the process of committing perjury oh by the way\nBut there's something else that he's been doing on Medicare for all and that is a a piece that he ended up a pending op ed\nIn the u._s._a.

president's that I did before him any time\nThat that could be entertaining and has a simple occasion we'll see where that story and\nA a story that I\nBelieve it is still being discussed one that has been\nLong perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we were just talking about\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time it's been the need for the minimum\nFor decades of time it's been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government now\nRecently we had the Amazon dot com in Greece to Fifteen dollars per hour which in and of itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built the I'm Better mouse trap but I mean the ... or so you want to talk about the ... the on the left and there was no balance remember a once upon a time Wal Mart was the goal in the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses\nAnd then they were putting a bunch of people on the ads minimum wage right a plus at Walmart\nThere from uh from\nRepublican place aren't they and their those people so I mean for all those reasons when Walmart which is a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com\nThey happen to be greater than ... the size of Wal Mart yes\nYes the Amazon is three hundred percent\nThese eyes and market capitalization of all markets by the left\nBut again you know I don't begrudge them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress where Amazon goes to fit and then you hear that the folks go\nEverybody should take Amazon's model now I Will point out some of the obvious here\nFor people to understand that get on the other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a little more to business they were getting crushed by Amazon study ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon ... scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering\nA they they they are killing their profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up dead and dying as we speak now\nThan not withstanding\nThe number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually check memories and\nIronically not the last time it was a really big issue\nIt got to like coming off the Occupy crowd\nIn the twenty fourteen mid term elections I happened to be about that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what\nA lot of folks in the country had a point because they did kind of thought\nYou know four years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth\nWe never even got close to an average US Economy\nSo yeah okay but\nWhat percentage of people on\nBack in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage\nEven in Morocco bombers the God I make one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two an avid it'd be working part time\nPeople that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nAnd a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people and how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nAccording to the bureau of Labor Statistics point percent\nPoint six percent that zero\nZero point six percent\nNow what's more is anti nine percent of those people\nBe point six percent\nAre under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as those wages we got the minimum wage conversation come up again\nOne of the great fraud perpetuated that's out there the living wage happen a good economy economics Amazon dot com profit prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's making\nOur we finally\nJust about three percent towards the wage growth by the time yet and bonuses goes over there by the time you add in your tax cut\nChurns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average Jeanette take home pay\nNow a fix going seven over here\nYou have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good so\nFunny what happens when you actually have a good economy you I don't have any weights\nAnd the minimum wage [noise]\nAnd I was just a bunch of BS [noise]\nTwo sides authorities one side of the faculty of getting you to do a lot more\nFactual stuff right here I Am Brian Moran one market will

been freed and there's now in Germany for a medical checkup his sister Laura reacting to today's news\nInteresting how even NBC ... one of their news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just oversight All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota a rough go\nProbably doing all good [laughter]\nWell I see it as kind of a two car problem really I mean you get a single payer healthcare system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospitals and with the smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it all there because they can't cut the cost\nThat the government wants to cut them down to for a lot of this stuff\nThat's the first part I see\nThe second part I see if we need to adjust them and the hospitals you know what it costs to manufacture up one thousand feet of sea bag of fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital and a lot more memory hundred dollars\nWell and and so Ross and I appreciate the ... you have a in a good point by day a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about\nInsurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability and healthcare is health insurance\nThe problem is we have been raised the idea that health insurance equals healthcare that's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare\nHas been the lack of people that could afford health care with health insurance according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interests\nBut here's what they found in their research\nThere are forty two million Americans foreign two million have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars\nNow if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only the average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off\nIf you had eighty five hundred dollars you could use on health care\nOr would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars went for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plans which then you can't hit which is why people can't afford health care\nThat's all part of the financial fraud\nThe number one way to get to more affordable health care is to break the back\nOf the insurance first model having embrace it was the first thing that we did that was a big time of day\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency\nThe most back crap crazy thing I've ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility\nBeing handed a piece of paper\nThat says in so many words about what ever happened in that facility\nWhich you have no clue and generally yet what that is going to be\nIn whatever it happens to cost\nWhich they generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for\nWhich they also can't tell you\nIs that you will Magid walking into a store\nOn a car with stuff\nNot haven't a clue what any of it costs\nAnd signing a piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for that\nCrazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to the way the way we use insurance for everything else in her life how is that well\nWhat do we do if we have a mechanical problem with our car\nWhile we we do pay and habits and asked\nIf we get in a big time accident we follow the insurance claims\nWere already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans\nCan't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that point to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and badlands and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know it's a it's the worst thing\nThat's essentially what they are as catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop\nAt when we get them on the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else it is that there and we'll take a look\nBest deal boom done\nWell with health care we never have a shot\nWe never have a shot at doing it one of the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look any time we have research that will show the costs of a procedure from one place to the next\nI had a minor surgery years ago\nI gone through my insurance\nWould have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars\nTo the point there\nWe never know\nBecause we sign pieces of paper those as something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that it's an insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans\nWill continue the conversation coming
