heck\nNo he tweeted out and I paraphrase that the president United States is well aware that he cannot change the fourteenth amendment of the constitution the hundred and fifty years of interpretation\nBy executive order and he's doing this for political reasons to divide the country and blah blah blah [noise] first of all the president didn't bring this up\nThe reporters interviewing and brought it up let me repeat this was an important factor Jim Acosta ignores intentionally the president didn't bring it up\nThe reporters interviewing him brought it up number one number two\nIt has not been\nThe interpretation of the fourteenth amendment for a hundred and fifty years\n\nIt had never been the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment\nIt hadn't been interpreted that way yet by the United States Supreme court\nThe fact of the matter is the bureaucracy disparate parts of the bureaucracy and then the bureaucracy generally began interpreting that way in the Nineteen sixties\n\nNo statutory basis for this\nThere is no constitutional basis for this we know what the author of the amendment which I'm black and white\nWe know what the chairman of the Senate\nWe know what the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee said hmm black and white I read it I reported on it I read about it\nHad nothing to do with this subject as a matter of fact the author of the mammoth the man who drafted him\nAnd his supporters of the civil rights act of the time made it clear that didn't exist that foreigners and aliens and so forth\nWhich is rational so when you were trumpeting the constitution people say rocket attacks look what it says you look at the tax the context of what the people who wrote it meant that originalist\nNow for the left they could care less they pour everything they wanted the fourteenth amendment so they all matter but the media which of course is not the left but it's not supposed to be\nTo be so ignorant Judd my costs then again the star trashing the president of United States who didn't even bring it up\nAnd he was surprised they came up\nAnd he was honest finished responds yes we're looking at a potential executive order\n\nTo attack him and say here is Mr Ray's fate or again it's I think it is beyond belief that the media conduct themselves this way I'll give you another example\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction these the answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry aren't president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is force he'll tell students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution ... for Hillsdale dot com that's L.

have after the balloting but uh but no early voting that would make you know in other states\nAll right so it's a very important that people get out on election day in Michigan tell us about your race what the key issues are in your opponent to\nOf course well ah the key thing about this race we have the opportunity to ... get bored I'm a combat veteran Hawaii that turned out west point graduate who served in Iraq and Operation Iraqi freedom most of our lives that are ... hours combat\nOr over there and I came back to grow my family business I'm ... thirty five million dollar thirty seven million but most importantly created a hundred jobs and around the country I Believe that having experienced a in combat healthy to understand national security I'm In a way that my opponent can't\nAnd understand veterans' issues in a way that my opponent has failed to but also I'm a business standpoint understanding how to grow our economy but also create economic opportunity for people who have been fail\nFor decades my opponent is a forty year career politician who spent Twenty years in Washington in Eighteen years as a senator and in that Eighteen years\nShe's only accomplish getting five or a co sponsor bills into law three of which archery named buildings I truly believe that we're open and Washington are legislating regulator futures are not going to be a part of and this will not change until until we stand up and take our government\nBack [noise] that's amazing how long has she been in the Senate she's been in the center for Eighteen years and she's been in state government forever to right\nYes I think it was actually I'm a first elected a forty three years ago in Nineteen Seventy five one last year the year now more officially ended yet a number of weeks ago she stood in front of a veterans service organizations\nAnd said that she was unaware of veterans issues that they weren't on radar screen we have been at war over a decade and a half and we still have a welcome there yet not veterans back properly and this didn't make that our priority list that's unacceptable\nI get to Washington I'm going to make sure that we prioritize our veterans that we prioritize healthcare would prioritize education to make sure that everybody has access to the American dream\nNow your website is John James percent at that time so if people want to contribute to your campaign all over the country and people in Michigan want to get involved in the last week campaign they go to John James for Senate dot com correct\nThat's right they can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter at jobs and they might let me tell you a this racism play with my candidacy\nLet me tell you I'm this racism played with my candidacy out when we first started out we were twenty three points out and I as of last by six points down but as we all know the liberals have done a wonderful job\nOf shaming people and bullying people and to not expressing their opinions and so given the fact that straight ticket voting is not no longer allowed in Michigan and the fact that conservatives don't poll we vote I Believe that we're even closer than that\nUm last quarter we always gotta be Stabenow\nFrequent six million are three point six million to her one point eight\nOr ... or if they're in between October first\nAnd October seventeenth because of uh of your listeners and some very staple grassroots army are folks were on the state and around the country we raised two million dollars to her a four hundred and Seventy one thousand we have the momentum and this race and uh by your help and assistance that we're going to win this thing under ...\nCounty uh\nTell me about the the two or three or four issues that you think are paramount\nUh well I mentioned them a belt veterans' issues I Believe that our veterans are facing\nNow let me let me let me address it this way economically the president seems to be doing the the right thing your your opponent oppose the tax cuts I certainly would have supported them\nAbsolutely your opponent\nSupports a massive bureaucracy with massive regulations without a legislative authority from Congress that that affects Democrats or Republicans and every kind of business whether it's car manufacturing or small businesses I assume you support the the direction in which the administration is going\nAbsolutely and and this is part of the problem of right now uh you have people in Washington like Debbie Stabenow who are trying to legislate a ... legislate industries they never run a business before\nAnd right now the over burdensome regulation the over taxation is creating a environments that are actually shipping jobs off\nA two to places like China and Mexico and turkey and then selling those goods into compete with us or that they're going to be ah that that uh that the administration is now correcting\nI Believe that by supporting a pro business environment it helps to bring all ship stuff and the folks like Senator stab now not only failed to vote for the tax cuts in jobs that that also created opportunities owns\nA in a rural and urban areas around the country but she's also voted to raise our taxes hundreds of times over the past Eighteen years she's not a a friend of business she's not a fiber economic growth and I'll tell you a she supports the socialist\nI'm a agenda that will bankrupt our children's future\nAnd she goes back to Michigan\nAnd she tries to appeal to Republicans independence blue collar workers by by doing this I'm a moderate I'm a centrist so I can work with the other side but she's hardcore left than she votes for ... to be the leader of the Democrats and she votes against cabin on she basically is a reliable left wing vote correct\nMarket is even worse than that uh according to them that are of interest happened now despite all of her a sign of bipartisanship is above where is the fix the ninth most bipartisan senator in the United states that that puts her more liberal than Elizabeth Warren\nDebbie Stabenow is more liberal than Elizabeth Warren and she supports things that that that that many people in this state\nA state that Donald Trump blonde absolutely find reprehensible a lot of cases are stepping up not bipartisan in fact she goes construction or Ninety five percent of the time and Hillary Clinton Ninety nine percent of the time and that's a solid a as a New York's ... after your own leadership she does not represent Michigan She represents New York and that needs to change them to
