acts\nAnd drinking and all you're not allowed to push back you see how thin skin they are folks\nIt was clearly belligerent aggressive angry and\nI thought there was a tough dynamic there and I watched him part of me thought this was a man who believes that he did nothing wrong needs completely unjustly accused and he's being railroaded needs furious about it said Coons Coons added that Kavanaugh's more partisan responses low made him question his fitness for the bench\nLet me just stop you there so the city it's like this is his buddy Chris Coons Adele of Delaware who was out to destroy cabinet and he positioned himself as ... you know I really thought this was a good guy to totally actually\nStarted pushing back\nYou know get to do it I don't you know where the United states

like Kevin O's mentioned to the Clintons and whatnot quote unquote but at it I had to put myself in that spot I think he gave a little leeway there\nNot flakes positioning of himself has some sort of unifying force whose sole mission is to save the Senate and the Supreme Court because he's driven by patriotic desires for national unity is unraveling\nThe plot the further stall Kavanaugh nomination was hatched Thursday night and Senator Susan Collins is or isn't that nice ladies and gentleman that she's been in the witness protection program I suspect\nShe's by maestro behind the whole damn

floor office in the capital\nShe and her Republican colleagues flake and Murkowski joined by Joe mansion well agreed they had the power to make or break Kavanaugh and without settling on precise details they decided to use their leverage to insist on a confirmation\nProcess that allows them to retake comfort level would cause a situation\nRather than to kill the Supreme Court nomination outright what\nResulted on friday afternoon through Washington and the chaos and guaranteed another week of uncertainty and says I'm I'm not done with this ladies and gentleman you haven't heard about

yours to\nCasper as a high quality mattress\nWould use as leverage and the narrowly divided Senate and threatened to vote no on the floor of Republicans refused to go alone\nNow there's something to somewhat disturbing revelation and the remaining Political Report quote\nCollins asked that Susan Collins that Kavanaugh's friend mark judge I'm Dr Ford alleges was in the room during the alleged assault sign a letter and send it to the committee rather than let his lawyer do it\nAccording to two Republican senators the letter was turned around in a matter of hours that Murkowski had endorsed an FBI investigation days before only to change your tune after meeting for more than a half hour privately with McConnell meanwhile\nFlake again with Coons into was proclaimed the hero at Saturday's global citizens festival and got a sixty minutes interview\nA one term senator who has accomplished nothing but self promotion an endless spit balls against the president United States who couldn't get elected dog catcher in Arizona\nThat Jeff Flake he Susan Collins Murkowski or the Republicans who did this\nAnd I want to say something to all three of them\nIf you three lousy good for nothing useless senators\nCosts us the Supreme Court\nWhen we have Republican control of all the branches of government because that's what the people wanted to do\nIt is you politically who will be held to account\nFor destroying these institutions for turning them over to the left I Want the people of Maine to know the people of Alaska I don't know\nThat when the primary season comes up we will do everything in our power even in these states where apparently there's a lot of liberals are a lotta cross party voting we will do everything in our power to challenge these women\nEverything in our

get that tell the country where to go and in this case they told us they go to hell\nThe media celebrate these people\nAs the media celebrate all on the left as the media cover for the left because they are the less\nAnd when you have individuals like Collins and Murkowski and the rest of them\nDoing what they do\nThat we need to do what we have to do in order to protect us republic\nAnd I'm not
