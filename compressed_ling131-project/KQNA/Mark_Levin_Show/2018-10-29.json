Ninety eight point five percent so that's not bad and college attendance and going into the workplace\nAnd these big programs where you can get a lot of time in the saddle are really good as well as in the local high schools they may not have as much time but it gives them a little taste and they can start working and getting familiar it's great I Know that really makes a difference in their academics\nHe has just opened and found meals or to a district that I serve and and there there are direct a healthy economy what can we do in Arizona to encourage the\nEconomy that we have going right now and keep it going\nWell Arizona is becoming more and more attractive for technology represented winter a work through the syntax sandbox a bill last year and it\nHas this high tech stuff is unbelievable I mean it's way beyond me I I Know friends can UJA but you used to go in you know teachable but I'm ... this little dog has a hard time with a cell phone but the regulatory environment and and know fees for two years on\nThe show financial technology companies were the only state that has it we hope that it will encourage we've already seen very encouraging signs in movement\nAnd as long as he was with water make sure that build land use\nA good transportation systems which are always working on your kid for basic strong and regular drip revenue approaches this and so many of you and others on transportation [noise] um you know those basic except to be in place\nAnd to use money wisely as legislators we want the folks to watch like hawks to make sure we do\nSpeaking of money a friend of mine is coming over the Senate to the house of representatives and um and he is a natural for appropriations and yet I said to him well do you want to ... and he said no I said why not because we have no money\nIs no money what you say that listening\nThe problem in a ... as you know I'd been hanging around the legislature\nAnd wishes my be Thirteen or fourteen years as a member\nAnd hadn't been representing mining companies and and you are a little bit there for twenty six years and the cycles grow up and down the challenges that we have is you have to have sufficient money for the long term baselines\nAnd if you have one time a ... pei [noise]\nThen you use it for things like capital maintenance and\nFix the stuff that's broken you it while you can in more short cycle of education to acceptable you know with Iran and critters over half the budget a lot of other things that folks voted on in the initiative and taken a clear away from us\nSo we can't even touch it and the appropriations process but this year it's been a very strong year and that friend that here's a ... I think he's more concerned just for a long term we we kept over extend ourselves let's pick your own budget your house my house\nWe're we're no different than any of our constituents who need to be smart with a buck and not overspending by a bunch of stuff that killed us in a downturn [noise]\nUm so we we do have and it's been a good year for income\nBut that doesn't mean it'll always be so we can't put that into a long long term investments whatever they may be\nWe have to pay things up we are for instance you know we don't even own own capital right we we had to put it\nUnder in a hedge fund you know they basically bought it from us and we buying it back for we pay three hundred million plus dollars a year in interest and in the in the the loan repayment\nAnd in the in the the loan repayment program to those interests than fees and and principle every year\nAnd and we were a million or so to the schools that we've done the roll over through the hard years and we need to take a big hunk of that and get it doesn't pay it up and et cetera so much money\nWe enjoy it but it's not it's like ... ... ... we're already or a lot of money to things and we need to take care of our debts before we go gallop Anton off\n... the the election I Know you're watching it just in a few short days we'll know what the legislature looks like how do you see our religious like to do the remaining\nAre primarily Republican there are so many new people coming into the legislature that do do you see remaining Republican both on the outside and the Senate side do seem to changes\nThere's no doubt that it's ... there's no doubt that both sides are energized I'm there could be some changes I think will keep the house the Senate to make matters around are millionaires in California and all over the place that are sticking money into these\nSome very important races but we've got good strong candidates I mean you know regard and and uh our speaker doesn't speak a minister and as hard and others are working hard I'm Mr when you're there I mentioned earlier smart people but the strikes\nAnd were but they're working hard and we hope to get them supported what a well we we have a college you're kind of a relationship between Republicans and Democrats I have personally noticed with much more radicalized\nThat they're the camps are drawing further apart and issues are more with less gray area and\nAnd that's sometimes very very difficult what I Hope that we preserve his decorum and civility I don't want what we've seen in Washington pro or con\nFor or against the the the baseline how they have acted I don't want that to come home and and and that our communities and our actions are disrupted by an civil behavior and that we all have a responsibility to maintain that no matter which way we go\nWe have seen individuals in art gallery who\nWho don't normally associate with decorum um the bail they scream or a certain amount of of cheering might be welcome but some people have taken it out as the realm of of good taste and uh and it's got to be controlled\nWell one thing I Hope to do is that everything will be right now all sessions all actions are on television and we encourage people to watch and that's a good thing\nOn the other side when people play to the camera\nThat's about the right and and uh unfortunately we have seen I have never seen Jay\nAnd twenty plus years going on thirty now the department so uncontrolled uh as I have seen in the last two three years and never seen that before and it it's very disturbing and I hope that we can call them down and try to focus on work rather than on grandstanding\nNew York times on the floor when I've actually been and I know a big guy and I'm not really tough but\nI have actually been fearful that some of those people were coming down to try to get us and I I Would hope\nThat there is the control of the gallery let me change very quickly and go to the border is there anything we state legislatures can do about border security\nBy the governor has its borders strike force to augment\nThe actions of of the federal authorities\nUm my brother worked for many years and as a with a National Guard and Arizona on drug interdiction it has always been a problem and I'm like I'm not talking about a minor problem the movement of people across the border\nAnd the bart ... let's say I'm going to use the term enemy someone who is a cartel a human trafficker is not in my friend he's not a friend of my country\nAnd he was an enemy of my country but they are well funded and there's just a kid and the communications\nSystems are very sophisticated\nAnd they watch may have checkpoints and garden a operation that watch our authorities very tightly and they are very strategic in movie people strategically across the border with contraband and people\nBut he started picking it apart and the and you can pick it apart because that amount of money has been given to education now the question becomes what do the school board\nThe question becomes what do the school boards do with the money that they're given the areas where there's the rub\nWell and I think is is is this goes forward over the the next couple of beers that right now the budget uh our economy looks good I thought last a legislative budget committee\nA forecast that came up budget update it looks like we're going to finish the year was about two hundred million\nAn ongoing funds a nine hundred million a one time money's which is you know that's looking at one point one billion dollars a to ah to to work with a and so\nI'm now it should remain it should remain very strong and uh I'll record for failing to what we what we did with the twenty percent by twenty twenty\nAre we going to be able to maintain a man who's been one of the one of the things that I Am attacked\nA ... I'm the I'm On social media when I talk about the amount of money that we have given to the education funds I'm I'm attacked saying well you won't be able to maintain that can we maintain it\nWell if I were to talk for their side uh we are into this recovery as though this is the longest recovery we've ever been in that it's turning out to be one of the strongest recoveries that come in but let me tell you why I think\nA week and a uh maintain this type of activity short of anything being passed that would really hurt the budget um and in Nineteen twenty Twenty one and going on out for example prop one twenty seven which you may or may not being talked about about the\nThe energy but once we if we keep taxes where they are or lower people ... first of all companies come here we've had three hundred companies coming here more are coming here nor are looking at us or is just an article in one of the papers tonight\nThat I was looking at a time over the weekend that a company is coming from California small sixty seven jobs are but they're setting up manufacturing here because Lancaster cheaper\nAnd because power costs are cheaper\nSo not only do we have an available for force that is educated that is educate that and I keep harping on that we have people ready to go to work that are capable of going to work\nUh at companies are coming here we have a we are a tax haven people come here from Illinois a Minnesota New Jersey California\nTo escape the high taxes of those states and so if if we understand that when government gets out of a way low taxes\nReduces regulations which we haven't talked about but I Will say Alaska that I had a war we were up to six hundred and Seventy six\nRegulations that we are that went away uh this last ... I'm a business here a fiscal year at the state that that said the businesses and organizations\n... you don't need these herbal Sudanese road blocks in a pot holes in your road\nYou mentioned one

to be paying more but does that have more of a\nSpending income it's not going to see it as big of a damage but I'll tell you what if you get into communities wore a you know they there's a lower income it's really good a hit\nFor those are those communities seniors ... years would be hurt a new one on their own unique receiver med be hurt\nAnd let me tell you a couple of things that ... in the press that in the some of the literature but don't get a lot of play schools are going to see it er and those are big power eater say eat a lot of power but second\nPart that hardly anyone is
