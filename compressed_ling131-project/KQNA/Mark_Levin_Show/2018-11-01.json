campaigning on the fact that she is a former CIA employee\nBecause of the left there's many of them trying to cover their trail they can try and cover what they really are and who they really are she will vote to impeach the president of the United states and Dave Brat\nAs a member of the Freedom Caucus he's crucially important that's an important race we're Barbara Comstock in northern Virginia she's the only Republican left in northern Virginia she there\nAnd she's being targeted by the gun control crowd Bloomberg\nShe's being targeted by up a lot of the pack and all the left is they want to take her down\nOf course conservatives have been disappointed with summer her positions\nBut the choices between her and the biggest tax or am I in modern times in the state Senate

right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote in the U.S shut it would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people in West Virginia [noise] they need to understand that when Hillary Clinton and her bunch talked about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens\nOf West Virginia told me one of the Democrats done in the last forty years for coal miners I Can't think of a single thing other than trying to put them out of work\nA look I think the biggest thing is when you of a presidential nominee who says we're not put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work\nYou might be able to say oops and try to take it back but the people West Virginia don't forget that's one of the major reasons why Joe mansions going down that seems true self\nThrough the fact is that Joe mansion vice president Pence said it right there when you don't need him he's never going to lead and he's certainly not going to stand together with President Trump\nAnd that's why more and more people as they're examining the contrast between my campaign\nAnd Joe mansion coming over to our side that's why we're tied or maybe I'll buy one and the latest poll we feel very good\nBut I have to tell you um are we have to get the word out\nBecause Chuck Schumer and the coastal elites Bloomberg and Soros and all these radicals they're coming in and they're spending unbelievable money we think it's going to be over twenty five million West Virginia most expensive state in the country per capita than the Senate election\nA Patrick Morrisey if America wants to donate to your campaign of the people of West Virginia want to turn out and supported the grassroots level what is your website\nOr our website is Patrick Morrisey dot com and that's to ours and want to ask since the folks consider donating twenty five dollars right now you'd make a difference we know that Schumer the other day just dumped seven hundred thousand more money in\nThe Democratic Senatorial Committee put a couple of hundred born today we're fighting like catcher in the arena and we're going to win but you know how we're going to when we went through these grassroots patriots that are listening to you mark\nHow people care about the constitution people care about the rule of law the separation of powers that's what I've been all about as the state attorney general West Virginia that's how I'm going to act in the U.S Senate buddy\nPatrick Morrisey dot com to ours want to ask and please twenty five dollars here twenty five dollars there the limits twenty seven hundred we need to fight that Schumer mansion Clinton team out because they've got the money but we've got the heart and we're like Trump Card\nAnd you know what if we can't get two Republican senators out of West Virginia to give him with the Democrats have done to your state it's going to be very very tough so uh I Hope the folks in West Virginia understand when mansion comes home and he smiles and he shakes hands any\nAny kind of doesn't Lincoln and not about the liberals in Congress and so when he votes with them Ninety eight percent of the time so I'm\nA and all these big votes you gotta sit breath mostly on the edge of your chair and wonder if he's going to come through or not as he's trying to figure out what is best for his his political career I assume Patrick you're going to take a leading role defending your stay you're going to take a leading role as a conservative\nWe are mark and and I appreciate you saying that as attorney general we helped lead a lot of these national challenges we stood against illegal amnesty and we were very strong we took on that rock Obama UPA time after time and look we say no to this piece enough shots that comes out of a laugh\nI mean what they did is absolutely outrageous and anyone who says that Joe measure ... only voted for Kavanaugh\nThey have to look back at one point do you know that all of the shenanigans and the obstruction resistant circus that we saw could have been avoided\nIf Joe mansion at stepped out earlier instead of taking a powder when they called his name per se so that he could wait for the state of Maine Susan Collins to pass the deciding vote\nThat's a profound cowardice and that's not going to be my approach on the exact opposite\n[noise] All right Patrick Morrisey I Wish you all the best I obviously support your effort very very strongly and give out your Web site again America can try and help you hear\nWell thank you it's Patrick Morrisey dot com and that's two wars and want to ask and once again if you'd donate twenty five dollars or a hundred dollars or whatever you can do I'm fighting gets the machine but I tell you what we're tied in the polls and I think we're going to get it done\nBecause I think people speak a lot louder than money but your money does help today isn't enough money to beat back these liberals\nPatrick Morrisey attorney general of West Virginia I Hope the next senator from West Virginia good luck to you my friend\nHey thank you mark and I appreciate you talk to me up the next couple of days\nAll right God Bless you take care of yourself to another great candidates folks\nAnd other great candidates
