Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back down to earth\nBut there's still people organizing this of course that have you noticed that that all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks weird\nBecause I think they all brand new backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop\nUs [noise]\nAnd if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we can't stop them\nWhat are we going to do\nYou know the Democrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill\nDon't hesitate to criticize President Trump for his policy of securing our border\nEnforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting criminals who break our immigration laws deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws it's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats too\nAnd Republicans until\nThey figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively for being an international list for being all about open borders for\nBeing compassionate uh you know what compassionate compassionate as not enabling people to continue to follow the same\nBroken destructive patterns that they have year after year after decade after decade\nYou know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change the hunter and government or the Mexican government you're terrified for your life in Honduras I'd get it gets what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change\nBut\nThat won't remember when we all love the Arab Spring\nWhere we had people rise up against their governments\nAcross the middle east because they were set up and they were done Hi is it time maybe for a Central American spring why as the default obligation for America and for the mainstream media to be all things are awful in these countries come when\nWe got your back why is that suddenly the definition of compassion why is that suddenly the definition of being a real\nAmerican ... if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really a polling American ideals are values are you\nKidding me since when and how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them India think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't they keep coming\nWhy because we left that men\nAnd said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat Senator Ben carton\nAh he is the senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led lesson 'cause it is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\nFought on one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America oh it's been supportive bipartisan Democrats or Republicans at some of the President Trump's\nBudget we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nHere that he goes on on this and then think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the highest level\nOf statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct to acceptable ... old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we send billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\nWe're bribing them we're bribing the government's down there to get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter hunger and that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country\nAnd they're angry at us\nFor saying no they can't come in to think about that for a minute you are an elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who elected you are fleeing your country\nTo go elsewhere in your response is not gene maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my an apt to corrupt government to come into your country\n... these countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing it\nCussing on our policies then fixing now and then you got a Democrat Ben Cardin who enables at\nWho enabled vet by throwing more money at it\nSo I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today and if you want you can get the whole interview over at my radio station to be a male\nDot com but I came back around and said All right let them I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fixed the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now because you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\n[noise] but I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I've been embedded with the FBI out of Central America I Know how dangerous birds are\nEither by the way I real fast let me just to be these he's response I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with the than we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nIt assigned you did you you you reach your own conclusion I refer you to decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years that came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors don't or they were all seven year old children\nReally they all had tattoos\n... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states to set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I understand the danger factor but as it relates to these gang activities\nI think most of the families that show up on our border or people who are see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America and some cases they have a legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek us all\nRight okay so fine so so let's say they're coming to this country to seek asylum what do we do\nIf they have a legitimate claim for assault let that claim should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper vetting\nOkay hold on I'm Sorry to stop you but wanting a better economic situation and being afraid of a criminal element in your home country are not legitimate claim\nThat are you I'm not I don't agree with you at one\nEnd and then I'm going to positive for a minute 'cause that's terribly important because the Democrats and open border Republican are doing this all the time they say well you know these people are just seeking asylum in our country they're looking for a better life and we need to be compassionate we need to follow international protocols for asylum\nIs seeking a better economic life is not a legitimate claim asylum\nBut living in a crime infested country is not a legitimate claim for asylum

thank you very much for it to any last year in Iran or the people by your presence there and all that in your interest we we had a lot of um Vietnam veterans or as you saw\nAnd um and the only event that honors\nThem and and um many of them were in in during the Tet Offensive because it started in January of Nineteen sixty eight and um\nIt was a massive I'm In the invasion of the various towns and cities throughout South Vietnam by the north Vietnamese army and the Viet Cong and the American military one all the major battles and people don't know that\nBecause there was a mood in the country at the time to to malign those who served in Vietnam until the media um you know misrepresented what went on and as you saw last night I presented a couple of video showing a Walter Cronkite my preparing to give his uh\nHis report on what happened at the Tet Offensive and at first he talked about how successful the American forces were\nIn the south Vietnamese horses were and then something happened and he turned around and change it and then when the the report that everybody's familiar with it but oh well we just started saying who won who lost we don't know but when you started saying we did the best we could come home none of the victors with those who really tried or something that affects\nOur servicemen who returned from Vietnam were not treated very well we're

are living on the streets were dealing with the veterans suicide Jews or a major major catastrophe\nBut that's a new group that's a new ... the only ones they're probably did mine I remember I'm an old guy I'm a Vietnam veteran and I was old even when I went there because I went through and got my education before\nI went in on active duty in four years of college a semester in graduate school in business in the year of law school and then I was a combat airport rape or two later that was I was twenty four years old when I was there a lot of these guys are Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen Twenty years old and uh so most of the Vietnam veterans\nThey're either they're either a lot of them are dying off or the yes some of them are homeless but the new homeless guys you know I I don't know why they're almost daily in this day and age because if they're veterans they got a lot of perks remember this is\nThis is where we changed to the all volunteer military they got a lot of money to go in and I assume they got some benefits coming out\nYour window about the ... you had to sell ... army are presenting the colors and you have people there\nPresenting the colors and you had people from the Vietnamese army the tuna last night we have a nice community support for the victims of both armies\nSoil as a sophomore at the University of Arizona\nBy advanced item grow role in the in the\nIn the advance program of army r._o._t._c. and I was a distinguished military graduate was offered the regular army commission same can be she'd get as a graduate of West point and I decided I didn't want to go in I'm In the end of the service right away so I took the reserve commission went to school some more and they change\nThe course of study and then went on active duty now I had a sense of what was going on or going on over there a lot of guys\nWere drafted by the way two thirds of the people who served in Vietnam volunteered only one third were drafted while in World War two two thirds were drafted one third volunteered that's a that's a fact that there is a fact a lot of guys volunteered because\nThey wanted to serve their country I don't know how knowledgeable they were\nIn geopolitics or history or government and I don't care I'm just appreciative and proud of the fact that so many wanted to serve their country because of the country was at war and and and and and needed people to help support the interest of our country\nDo how do they feel I think some were there they didn't know why they were there and I know that some of them got caught up with some of these anti war movement like Vietnam veterans against the war\nYou know John Kerry's group and others like that uh\nYou know they probably don't even know why they were there and maybe they felt this was a cause they can get involved with and besides Jane Fonda was involved in it and maybe they want to re near and around Jane Fonda I don't know but I Do know that most of the veterans that I Know\nAnd you saw last night Jay those were in Vietnam veterans that came on up there to to receive a special commemorative coin that I have designed specially I entered a design and specially made for a this fiftieth anniversary of the Vietnam War and the bottom line is uh uh they're they're they're proud of their service\nAnd so do I know I I haven't taken a poll and I don't think anybody's taking a poll that a ... except I haven't seen statistics that say over Ninety percent of those who served in Vietnam\nAre proud of their service some work but you know I I Am saying all have to clean it up when I said I say some people were dumb and I use the word structure that if it ends with a\nK. and and it's a poor all with an s on it before they went to Vietnam they were dumb blank when they were in Vietnam and there are dumb black when they came back from Vietnam and you know you just can't fix stupid and so what what most of the people who served in my view and I know a lot of them as you can tell from that dinner\nI'm clear proud of their service\nYou know what to me seems to me because I don't know enough people knew that we won the war in Vietnam we will never be there was new Beth who we ever lost new but very few new now do\nYou know why that is because\nAnd this up getting into the weeds on this and Jay if I may say this I mean I've read if I've read one book on Vietnam I've read fifty okay\nBut the but the war was reported that not by historians it was reported by journalists\nAnd that's why our speaker you had three speakers you at me and you had criminal generally Strickland and we're both almost Vietnam veterans both in Vietnam at the same time both served in the same division at the same time and you had\nMark more you're a young guy a bright guy up if you looked at his resume their written a lot of books and he couldn't get a job with in academia\nBecause he wrote same positive things about our service in Vietnam very articulate very bright kind of low key kind of soft spoken but if you listen to what he said he said all the right things and the the problem was that academia\nAt the time was was was writing against the war because they just took the party line and and the people who got the made the most noise when the media types\nCarmel she hand and Albert strum those three names carnal she had an album shouldn't and they weren't journalists I mean they weren't as strong as they were journalists\nAnd there's a great book out I highly recommend it to for people to really try to understand the beginning of the war it's called it's written by a guy named Shaw it's called the last mandate of heaven and it's about GM the last mandate of heaven\nI highly recommend people read it seen him was independent he was a little ruler of South Vietnam which was an independent country and I hadn't been\nFor a long time in in Vietnam was independent or a country ... ... you know it's ... by the French in the in the fifties and Jim was a ...\nOh by the French in the fifties and jam was duly elected leader there and uh his ... he had a brother and sister in law and maybe remember madam knew that dragon\nLend you with on a shoe [laughter] news\nAnd damn gamble was well respected he was well like I Know where to run around the time but I tell you the\nTruth will this time from the time was new going\nOK bottom line the bottom line is DM dam was well respected he was a national she's ... nationalist and he didn't eat the whole team and captured him at one time\nAnd saw the gym was so sincere about Islam for his country that oh gee man couldn't during her become a capitalist he let him go he let him go and so Jim Rome this country and they were Americans tried to\nProselytize him you know we Americans are the ugly American women in the way we we go over with anybody we deal with and we want them to do with our way it's our way or the highway and damned wanting to maintain as independents\nAnd some of the Buddhist general didn't like Jim because Jim and his family were Catholics they were ardent Catholics in fact\nIf his brother was the archbishop\nCatholic archbishop his brother in law was Catholic his sister was Catholic\nAnd the Buddhist wanted to have a\nA ceremony Buddhist are celebrating something regarding Buddhism the same time when there was a another event that was a was a Catholic event and and they said you got to do it different ways anyway he allowed the boot has to do it but they didn't like the way he did it and so some agitator\nTried to attack um uh the palace or GM or wherever it was a it was a government that that government forces and some people think they were were they were were basically it was communist educated but some of the communist forces killed some of these people because of Buddhist were involved\nAnd killed some boot us because they the communist used the Buddhist to try to implement some of the political uh activities\nAnd so this really infuriated or the Buddhist and then you read ... I don't know do you remember the immolations among when they set fire on themselves\nRemember something about it you know\nYes the picture Buddhist monk sitting there and they set fire to bring in the middle of the street or they did that in protest and you hear these among for old and they put a lot of people think they're on drugs anyway um but the bottom line is\nSo DM and the Buddhist now are at odds with each other and some of these voters journals or didn't like damn they contact the gamut Cabot lodges ambassador instead we wanna we want to overthrow damn\nCabot Lodge talk to a guy named John F. Kennedy was a president who was on his yacht at the time probably you know having a few cocktails with his wife and and I said well you guys do what you want to do what's kind of a half a half hearted okay\nAnd so they captured they took over the palace they captured dam and his brother\nAnd put them in the back of an ABC and there's a famous picture both of them there were executed and they're they're both dead in there and that created a lot of turmoil that some other leaders in there and then communist started advancing more and getting more powerful so then we in Nineteen sixty five we decided we better we better send some troops\nOver there to stop the spread of communism\nAnd I got there in Nineteen sixty eight January sixty eight\nJanuary thirty first event in sixty eight the Tet Offensive started so I was there protests and operated around outside of way but the to lead the twenty thousand man operation in the case on then we went into the oshawa valley and then we came back and\nWorked up and down the coast which the French called ... on the street without joy bloody area and I accidentally lived through all that stuff and got out of the fields assist us supply officer for a while\nAnd then rotated down south where they went to a battalion the seventh cab on the second battalion seven cabinet first star cabaret division\nOperated there and then I D roast in January sixty nine came back home what right back into law school and was shouted down during the October more joined by all these strapped are just talking about all we've all our soldiers were being over there and I we're picking on the poor Vietnamese people just wanted to take over their back their country\nAnd and didn't want interference by this this capitalist who are trying to take over the country and I and I hated the anti war protesters ever since\nI became a registered Republican I board voted for supported a Nixon I thought he was a great president the Democrat Scott I'm Out of there and and then we went back and forth for different presidents and then they go back and forth and I'm not going to get involved too much in the weeds of politics\nBut all wars are political J I don't care what anybody says whenever anybody wants to tell you we're going to war because gods on our side or it's really just or or you know for whatever half hearted reserve all wars or political and I didn't make that statement up barren bone plus which said that war is politics by another means\nI don't I wasn't there that I put I don't know where they actually sentimental but then then when they set up the Base Camp at ... and then from there we did with the first Cavalry Division there that if you saw movies if you saw apocalypse now if you saw we were soldiers once and young we were the first their capital division were the best\nSoldiers once and yeah we were the first there Gabrielle division were the best combat unit I think in the history of the United States Army\nUh we we were almost invincible and I mean you know and and then when the war ended they just disbanded it made it the armor unit again because nobody wanted to say anything positive about the Vietnam War that's why nobody knows about case on\nIt's ironic though there were there were a newspaper or a reporter's\nWhen when we went into case on my particularly for to indicate sign to read them leave the really the Marines that case on and and and the Marines don't like to hear that for so long they often would say well we bought our way out\nI said oh yeah really there when I was a call the Seventy

colonel jointly Julie let's talk about the\nFilms that talked about for the new more than some of them were just almost frightening germ when they showed um warriors off by themselves running their own war and you remember that one of the some of the films we remember\nWell before we get to that let me regain myself with ... with with the Marines okay ... Marines fought didn't the brunt of the\nFighting along the DMZ they did a tremendous job at the battle of way they were great fighting force\nAnd they were they held all type of case on they were put in an identical position they were like uh\nLike the the foreign legion put out in the middle of nowhere with all the bad guys trying to attack there for the first Cavalry Division were twenty thousand others Rand Marines who helped us with that to\nBoth the uniqueness of our unit is we had the air mobility we can go from point a to point B by helicopter and send an armada of gun ships and troops and carry on artillery behind a planet and then to set it up and fire it and so the Marines did a fantastic job case on\nBut they were under siege and we we did roll to mentally end the siege and Marines that were there and know that they appreciate it and I'm not going to disparage and Marines as his off when you get this ... rivalry and a while we get it I've heard it before and all that stuff too and\nAnd when they started getting to to be on it then I'm\nYou've covered yourself Joe you've colonel covered All right see one of the loop smell\nApocalypse now I like apocalypse now because it's the best movie to show what a combat air assault looks like you know that scene where they're coming in or coming in from the rising sun you know\nWe have seen in the film\nWell it's not the first scene is it's it's it's it's it's there are other change in the film where two wheelers gotta go out and and and get the story that he's got to go kill colonel Kurds Sunnis are on the both the river patrol boat but when they're\nWhen they when they're alec operas or blind or there because they make us colonel I'm In a knot Kurtz uh what was that progress had occurred there could was named\nA new walls character or he wants to go surfing and so they want that beach in is controlled by the Viet Cong a that scene\nComing on in there where the to the pilot in the co pilot or there and you're you're looking out the front of the helicopters either the beach is getting closer and closer and closer\nThat's I used to sit right behind them as a chair right there where to put their leader I'd be there and I'd ever about four or five guys and I'm In the ship with me and then I'd have other ships behind me were there\nWhen I say ships I mean helicopters are ready to land and then go out and do battle and uh that that that took place in the rest of it is oh okay it's about killing world colonel and then this thing gets all these amount of yard and it's all\nYou know kind of weird and then it gets into psychedelic stuff and if you saw apocalypse now ... do you see the extension of the things with the with the the the donut ... but the um\nThe the the donut ... not the donut dollars but the ... the uh the gals that are only thinking I'm not that not ... what am I thinking of the special\nCertainly Marlon Brando and that was a real pleasure no no no no one about the deer hunters there was probably you know I like I like well\nThen that thing about that the the a shooting there but you know the Russian roulette I never heard of that that was a good scene at first too though where they're they're they're going along and then all of a sudden everything's fine and then all of a sudden\nThe round start coming in and you know everything turns to hell and then they're captured and and then uh you know that's that's that's that's baloney that's that's all that so\nHighly will middle jak too\nFull metal jacket the most interesting part was dynamics between the the dollar D who later she committed suicide and and and the and the sergeant who later become an actor and some other things\nToo but uh um uh the disarmament was killed but uh then they let me do this kind of surreal is taking the battle way the sniper taken up these people we I think was um uh you know they they did a good job of showing what it was like out there snipers on that but there was more than that\nThere's more than just one separate there were a lot of NBA and the way the NBA we're occupying way they killed a lot of civilians they found like about four thousand buried civilians\nAfter the battle went to the Marines I don't know how many weeks that basically clear that it basically you know the old story so story they had to destroy the city in order to save that

American and so ... lead you and I assume for the sake of argument which the Saudis and there's more and more or less have confirmed\nThat an unsuspecting Jamal ... walked into a Saturday a consulate in is the amount turkey is tumbled turkey to be tortured and killed over a seven minute\nPeriod now that's bad not good but those things happen in that part of the world all the time if you steal something you chop off your hands men and women are hand\nOr use source to chop their heads off on a regular basis a woman who commits adultery stoned to death in the public square mass\nThe violence is happening all the time and not part of the world according to CNN especially\nWe're now supposed to get twisted into knots and drop our support of the president and I want to blow up America's relationship with Saudi Arabia which can cause a half a trillion dollars\nAnd now Saudi Arabia has a relationship with Israel as a counterbalance against Iran for just a drop all of that because the Saudi Arabian once killed in Turkey I don't get it I don't understand and the other thing the moral outrage fell by CNN is not shared\nBy them when a police officer is killed\nFor example officer Jason Ellis who was killed in May of a twenty uh Thirteen about five years ago\nAnd it's killer has not been apprehended CNN did not even a report is death\nThis year in America about one hundred cops are going to be killed the great majority of the perpetrators will be located but on the other hand some will not be located you mean to tell me that the death of ... ... has more impacted my life and then the death of a police officer\nOr the death of a truck driver\nOr the murder of a college student in Iowa or a school teacher or a child innocent kids\nOr a school teacher or a child\nInnocent kids or kidnapped and raped in America all the time young black men about seven hundred will be gone down in the south side of Chicago women are raped and brutalized been tortured on a regular basis happens inside of America much less\nAnd other parts of the world so why is the media focusing on\nA murder and turkey\nBecause if the journalists exchange may ... show was not a journalist there was a part time contributor to the Washington Post but\nEven if he was quoted a journalist who have more value to me that a police officer or someone to someone I American soldier killed absolutely not\nYou know I I I'm waiting for the outrage from CNN about forty Mexican journalist\nMurdered in the past two years in Mexico by drug cartels have you heard about any there to you know who they are\nTo me the show ... narrative as a hostile it's fake news it's a ploy used to attack Donald J drum to undermine his Middle East policy which is works so well there are supporting his death and weapon I think his death\nAs a cudgel against the Trump stir about what's going on\nBut I guarantee you he his wife as no more value than a truck drivers lied for cops lied for soldiers live a ... for coal miners live a taxi drivers life all the might be murdered brutally tortured happens all the time in America and elsewhere so why is the death\nOf a Saudi Arabian in Turkey big news because the media wants to use that as a club against the president and the middle east policy and I think there is those at CNN and mainstream media that do not do not like the fact that Israel now as a friend and Saudi Arabia\nThey don't like that and I thought the half million Syrians killed by Iran and by Russia by barrel bombs any of those lives have meaning to CNN no because they cannot be used as a weapon against this president they want to\nAct as if on Trump's parents bad things about journalist so Maui indirectly calls the death\nOf Jamal can show in Turkey who believes this crap because they'll believable but let's continue flying becomes available which are never does one eight six six six or seven seven three three seven the thing is\nTonight if we can focus on illegal migrants swelling to ten thousand found to reach the U.S supported by the Democratic party and founder of eyes are there any through media and the fact that ... if it was my father if he was my brother I'd be outraged to add is that there was should not have died\nSaudi Arabians do this all the time Syrians Iranians Iraqis inside of America there are several hundred black guys killed every year in Chicago and one hundred dead cops can you name one cop killed in America this year give me the name and your mind thing give me the name of one cup right now\nI bet you can't\nGo to the media doesn't cover it you mean Jamal cause showed me a Saudi Arabian killed in Turkey is more important to us about a brave police officer who gave his life is that what CNN believe the answer is yes\nThey want to huge show V. as a cudgel against Trump\nAnd why I have no idea they must have nothing else to talk about\nThis country when we do is go right to the cold\nWind becomes available you know the return built counting on the great America [noise]\nFar enough to live with you\nOf this a spot for tourists are getting leaders so the whole thing is\nI Know and and you want to quickly but use backers than had a leader\nWho would boil alive his political opponents and well that was going on Obama and Hillary reports e footing around with this guy in the media\nThat that was no big deal right there boil alive your political opponents that's okay because Obama had the relationship and Hillary had their relationship and he was bigger than the median income that are all did they\nKnow and you know it's funny there are people on\nNPR that work\nTo our to our to our show every week and and they make three hundred thousand dollars a year now she is fine except I don't want to subsidize so\nYou know ... you know why should we pay for NPR PBS but you know like Facebook and Google and Microsoft Starbucks and Amazon let them pay for it or people that like it in San Francisco or Boston or watch the average horrible taxpayer subsidized in the ... the clowns they have on that\nStation on a regular basis we're biased a propaganda\nAnd then there's hundreds hundreds of rent their ears a thousand radio stations and it was five hundred television stations\nA thousand radio stations it was five hundred television stations but we taxpayer subsidized PBS and NPR for what reason well what's the purpose is because there are a left wing liberal Democrats and the Republican Party has no communities that's why it's done\nRight well I'm not for killing people but I mean hell no words you don't like\nIt is not a nice after your trophy enrolled at like ... in a gossip walk I Do my wife is very cheap around the world and you you know but people who pick and choose their atrocities and their spots or should be ... and ... and that's the media thank you\nAnd your great thank you you're going to go to Jim in Chicago a billion obese gym in Chicago welcome to the bill Cunningham show Jim go ahead\nThank you served [noise] just to let you know I ah I have a home in San Pedro Sula Honduras [laughter] and I'm also a resident of the country and I am totally opposed to what's going up the going on\nAnd tell me you spent time in Honduras talking about the circumstances and violent the economy is\nIt's it's kinda like it because if you live in Chicago I live in Chicago and all you hear about from people that a lot of other places they compete they talking about Al Capone or there was a violent split it's like any section you know there was a lot of wonderful places there sure and there's a lot of stability that area's however [noise]\nPart of the problem is the government there doesn't do things well they think like Obama they just want to raise taxes\nFor example if you go to a restaurant or food it's ... percent sales tax on food and if you order like a like a drink it's Eighteen percent tax for a drink at a restaurant [laughter] you know and plus the value of the ... has been sliding to the dollar itself to twenty four limbs per dollar used to be ... years ago it was like twenty\nTwo and a half pounds in the government democratically elected what isn't\nWell this last election there was a big uh uh this name as to his initials or a jail wage\nBecause he used to be before Honduras just had one term for four years and then when the bomb was president he somehow was able to get the legislature to make a two terms and people didn't like that and there was a lot of writing in the streets in fact they closed on ah they're they're called the ... they're called the Elvis\nAnd what they did is they closed all the highways and stuff so people couldn't get to the airport and actually suspended flights in San Pedro a couple of times because of that [noise] and and what they did this last time he'll they have these these like ... who was leaving the city there's three ... three major toll booths\nAnd they they just bring them out they just destroyed the buildings and the toll booths are no longer collecting tolls [laughter]\nAnd that's a that's a major hit you know and and it's it's just it's amazing when I was down there the one time I couldn't actually get home I had to wait for two days and you could hear the gunfire in the background San Pedro was like a huge valley surrounded by mountains or do you\nWant to live for the average Honduran kind of what's it like\nWell if you have money you do well if you're poor you don't want to be there because there was no public assistance for the public hospitals are Laden with cockroaches [noise]\nBut you know there's a lot of beautiful restaurants there the food is wonderful you know it's it's so it's like it's mixed you know I've been going there for thirty something years of my ex wife I'm a strong there and that was part of the attraction I went there and I have two daughters with her they're teenagers now\nAnd I'm Still good with my my inlaws and thinks it's nice but you know you gotta be careful you don't want to do bad business deal with anybody because it's a good chance who could get hurt\nOkay now now you said you're again Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and Nicaragua is coming to America while you were getting\nWell it doesn't serve a purpose you know the same energy they see a lot of this is being ... funded by these left us you know George Soros types and and you know they should spend the same energy and resource to try to fix what's wrong in their own governments\nStand your dream fix your own country while he's leaving the best and the brightest might be leaving you leave behind those who can't function so it's really in the long term in that's\nWhat happens a lot of people with means a lot of hunter as they should have gone to Spain and a lot of them come illegally here you know in fact I hate to say that's one of my good friends actually got killed about five years ago he was involved in a bad car deal that the transaction [noise] and he got off right they got killed right before Christmas\nSo you don't go in and you get a gun kill somebody\nYeah and his brother actually had a tourist visa and he\nLeft his you know he's in the California for the last five years he ... he gotta you're going to get married is going to try to get us paperwork these via marriage so a lot of people with the resources have left and come over here and then try to stay here you know like getting married he was doing something else to become legal\nRight it's it's a big problem he also down there you know their energy consumption they keep raising the price for ah for electricity it's all diesel powered\nA male generation it's not efficient as expensive and they keep raising the price of energy [laughter] you know my water bill's gone up you know like fifty percent of the last four or five years\nSo it's a broken society nothing's working and getting well it's it's\nNot nothing but that could be better managed to put it that way\nOn who's doing the managing it is in a military democratically elected it doesn't matter in Honduras\nWell the president was actually reelected the second time but a lot of people thought he stole the election that's why there's a lot of writing the streets and that's why they had these strikes you know\nBut that's all kind of died down now for the problem is you know they keep raising the prices of everything [noise] so if you're if you're stuck down there and you're not you don't have a job where you can be tied into dollars so to speak you know things keep getting out of sight but just like that as well now has been as well that's nice\nBut it's the whole thing with inflation and try to keep up with stuff\nAnd it's always there's about thirty eight forty million people who live in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua about thirty five to forty million how many will come to America given a choice of the immigrants got in charge and a complete open borders how many would come\nI'd probably say a mall all of them [laughter] forty million right that would come [noise] but you know it's funny because there's also a lot of there's a lot of a love for American hunter I see a lot of stores like Congress or as you'll see the American flag you know ... you know on the wall she last\nYear or so there in fact I was even that does is getting off the site or a little bit I was thinking it would be good to make Honduras the fifty first state of you know like oh my God [laughter] and the reason why is it gives people if we if we can come and run their country\nAnd gear or local government would people would jump to that and they would be more patriotic the news\nI Jim thank you but here's impact doing some island dance raining Honduras is Ninety five per one hundred thousand nine and ten most violent countries on earth or sell the u._s. border sixteen or the twenty most violent or sell U.S born on the other four are small countries in Africa\nSo we're we're taking in large numbers of immigrants\nWho knows violent places on earth none of them are scrutinized whatsoever none of them are looking into research no there's no papers there's nothing just let them in his ... Nancy Pelosi so if you live in a state like Ohio which is goes back and forth if you vote for a Democrat you're voting for forty million Central Americans to come to this country\nAnd use our hospitals or medical schools whatever it is\nYou're you're willing to them the print than completely packed we're talking about the collapse of American society is what we're talking about continue with more forty nine minutes after the bill Cunningham the great American live with you every Sunday night [noise]\n\nThe\nSeventh Daniel fall foreign yard sales going on now with incredible deals lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale\nFrom just thirty nine cents skin would look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off refinished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nAre you considering a safe for gun safe districts your your valuables and firearms so before you spend any money on any typical run on a middle safe check out the amazing handcrafted rhino iron works shapes had\nRhino safe dot com see for yourself why rhino safe customers are so passionate about their antique industrial style safes and if you're a gun owner you on the convenience of swing al ... has a huge dealer network great pricing warranty in customer service so don't you", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "22"}
