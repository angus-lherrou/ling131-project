truly mean if they have Rhonda scientists the\nRepublican running for governor of Florida on this program I have been a fan of his since the day was elected I watched him work in the house of representatives he is solid he has enormous integrity he's a he's an Iraq vet is a very smart guy I graduated from Harvard and he's so smart and um\nAnd he's taken the lead on so many issues that are important to this country run to scientists how are you my friend\nI'm doing good mark how're you doing\nI'm doing fine and you know I watch this debate last night with your opponent Gillum and I got to say this\nBefore we get into substance he is a very nasty guy and I mean the ... he turns to you and he must have called you a liar twenty times uh he uh he just said some incredibly snarky things and I thought to myself\nThis guy's cocky he thinks that ... he has it in the bag and I suspect he does not mean and what did you make of the debate\n... book I think I think that whole performance was really beneficial for me I mean you know when you're running for governor mark obviously you know voters are going to look to be you know did they agree or not and so I'm somebody who's running on keeping Florida low tax aid he wants to map the pack\n\nHorse meant he's running saying that we should abolish ice which are there different obviously it's huge policy differences but and the governor's race um ... it's sort of like a senator a house race it's more than just about your position because about leadership who could actually do the job but I think his antics\nJust showed that he's not somebody that would be a good governor even apart from his radical left wing ideology so I think this whole performance back fire\nI think a lot of people that and then looked at me and they obviously now get a sense of my biography my service of the country I'm not a day or the easy decision is that I'm just a better leader than go on\nOne of the things that's a very very troubling to me knowing you know for several years you lead the fight in the house of representatives to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nWhen nobody thought it would go anywhere you lead the fight in the house of representatives pressing for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\nYou succeeded along with the president along with are are wonderful bachelor Freeman and so forth\nAnd then for him and his party to suggest that you're supported by neo Nazis [laughter] when in fact are the biggest voice for the state of Israel and the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nWhile I think it was so ridiculous that I think voters just about all I mean give me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and he's been endorsed by this radical left\nCapital and he's been endorsed by this radical left wing group dream defenders and he actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical manifesto they have\n'em and this group dream defenders one of their main ah things is boycotting Israel B.D yes they say Israel a genocidal apartheid state so that's the group he stands where he will not just of Elvis group that is who he is\nAnd I'm actually just today there was a group of we're already a sheriff's\nIn Florida right go I'm a letter asking him to go about their dream defenders because uh the pledge that Gillum signed\nA said bad police in prisons have no place in justice they want to abolish are basically traditional law enforcement get funded and then spend the money on welfare programs with very radical stuff it's drifting with hatred for men and women\nAre in law enforcement and it's just totally unacceptable and go on and he will not budge maybe you can buy that and and that's just unacceptable cross or yeah for him to say that I was um\nI think it was a total for hours and that's the thing voters are sicker people on the ...\nAh just lashing out white grad folks and and I could get really backfired big car\n[noise] you know ... when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to it so there's no confusion\nAny signs of partition in favor of boycotting Israel he signed a petition in favor of moving police officers out of prison and more than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and move it under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his problem is he rejects law enforcement and your point was this\nOnce a criminal alien served time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they're either turned over to the fetch who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being deported isn't that basically has position\nYeah I asked them on Sunday nights evading CNN will you honor\nA dictator request they're called ... when the federal government wants to take a criminal illegals coming out a program\nWhere are you on a dictator requests from Donald Trump's agency he would not say he would do that and so he can say oh I don't want criminals on the street to the top the matter is he pledged not to cooperate with ice with idea that all he wants to do is move with under the Justice Department\nMark you know that in trying to backtrack office position you know where he was running ads in the primary thing abolish ice because they want to open borders got far left one\nAnd he was playing the base so the idea that all he wants to do with like a ministry his tweak or he's lying when he says that he wants to abolish the agency because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\n[noise] now when we come back after the bottom of the hour run to scientists by the way what is your website Ron\nRon ... D than the dot com\nOr we're going to put it up on my social sites ladies and gentleman runs the big time outspent\nDisguise Soros behind them has got Styron behind them all a left wing billionaires and left wing groups they're targeting Florida they know if they take Florida it's going to be very difficult to win the presidency in the future and again behind a true Bernie Sanders George Soros people for the American way which is so he works\nFor radical\nWhen we come back I Want to ask run the census there's an FBI investigation that's been taking place in Tallahassee where this guy was mayor\nAnd Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it while they write back\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel whoever the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Irish they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them after I got the IRS to designate Nathaniel case as seat in the status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on Nathaniel spy happen till the IRS agreed to a deal that saved them thousands to resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem\nAre honest hardworking Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends would opt them a tax relief\n[noise] Enron descent as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race now last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody\nRace when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm of value to try and see if they'll take it and he took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOr her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\nShe's a Cuban American\nCuban American and and when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking a female Hispanic and the history of Florida government\nMhm I noticed the media doesn't talk much about that\nNow of course not but I'll tell you with Andrew lashing out like this I mean\nWhen you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this office to feather your own mess like games or did they match the problem it's interesting mark there wasn't just a\nThe illegal stuff that he died when he was on the Tallahassee city commission\nOr he did vote to raise property taxes on people but he also voted to increase his own retirement benefits by tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling could pay a fine so he wanted people how happy to pay more and he wanted somebody to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing\nPolitician or whether elite whether it's legal votes like that which are corrupt anyway\nOr illegal activity like accepting the Hamilton ticket and turning around and giving these guys the deal they want it\nAny work for this group people for American way is that correct\nYeah and here's the thing about that that's a very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing they say they pay Andrew Gillum Mrs while he was mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year to work forty hours a week\nWell the mayor of Tallahassee is a full time job so how did how was he working forty hours a week\nFor people for the American way so one of two things are true either he is actually doing that in which case the glass thing that people have power happy which may explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and have one of the most uh uh they have the highest crime rate in theater or\nHe ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he's basically accepting money without performing services so one or the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confusing admit the nation is in the Floridians are too you can be mayor and have a tide job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entering a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah and I think the question as their\nPeople for the American way said that was in exchange for him working forty hours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to them but if he was working forty hours a week with them\nHow does that make people tell athlete feel you know they have the it's out of control crime problem the raising of taxes he's doing all these gangs\nAnd yet he's working for the left wing group so it's a problem either way but it's interesting even though the documents are out there\nUm journalists do not pursue that at all I mean if I if I Walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk you know they tried to do a do different stories on me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really that should be investigated by the crap\nI Want to hit to other things before you go and that is health care and taxes\nHe uh has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare\nEveryone when they don't employ your private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union is negotiated a health care plan they will lose their health care plan\nEverybody will lose the health care that they have now\nWith some theories some ... some concoction they'll create or Washington DC we'll have the scientists to them whether you like it or not whenever you have today disappears and what does this response to that and he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nOne little correction market it eliminates I think that for about three hundred million people\nThe two things at Bernie's bill keeps or the VA in the Indian Health service so no I guess that means that all that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent her health care if they do this but bottom line is right so here's the response is when I called them out on that was basically to act like\nYou know what I was talking about he was running commercials saying single payer Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that it's toxic and Florida because we have senior citizens who have their arrangement they've been playing in the Medicare the Medicare Advantage program\nWe have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer through their employment\nAnd he would take all of that a way you have no choice you get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know\nWill cause tax increases it will bankrupt ah\nIt'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration and so yeah you may have the right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor that got to be able to perform that there'll be waiting lines and we know the drill and all that so that is not popular once people know what it is and so basically he just tried to run away from it\nAs much as he can um even on the primary he would gang that that's the way that you win win in Florida so we're going to keep reminding voters\nGet about ... about ... taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states and you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reasons you have such a dynamic economy since such a diverse economy in Florida and I'm a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between the no tax income tax day and I have a home and I my primary residence in Virginia and an income tax state\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making it says I'd never supported a state income tax\nThat's what these guys do I saw in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not an ... and then they push and push the spending and the debt and then either they push for an income tax or some court quarters an income tax he supports an income tax and in truth enemy\nSo there was a study done a nonpartisan study that analyzes all his spending proposals and the conclusion of the study was\nThere in order to make it work he would either need to do one or two things have a statewide sales tax\nOf thirty eight percent or impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes where he would be able to pay for because you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff\nAnd that's what it would cost so you go down that road ah Florida is a ... I mean they were totally critical our economy and critical our state and we obviously can't let that happen all that all\nFifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure\nAll the cities are trying a what they wind up doing is the the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who are punished because what happens is people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even chains can't afford it\nAnd so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places and people lose jobs they lose camps\nI mean this doesn't help people actually mandating a Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequences\nAiding at Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequences of it\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got to college I work all these jobs for six bucks an hour\nThrough college I wouldn't have been able to get through without that and it Illinois policies were in place I Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made zero\nBut yeah I Would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people out of work he will cause businesses to shut down businesses to lead the state um but here's the thing markets Seattle thing you mentioned a lot of the people who who who kept their jobs and they'd get a pay increase to five Fifteen\nThey still ended up with less take home pay because their hours got reduced by the ...\nSo it's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he's ... he doesn't care and this is what he's running\nIt's particularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job\nSame with his open borders policies that particularly harms a low skilled or low skilled the unskilled or low skilled individuals but uh he claims to represent these people but his policies crush these people run dissent is\nOnce again what is your site America we have a love in search let's give all the support we can Toronto center in Florida let's increases ground game there and the grassroots there where people go if they want to help you\nWere on the Panthers dot com R.

all my stamps just to make use of them um and put them in a mailbox didn't run them right to a post office when those parents came right back to me and the reason it was terrorism and I'm just\nTarget

stamps that just kind of you know have to go to the post office for trapped in a regular box and not animals a K they immediately\nThese were these worry in some cases intercepted I I Would make a recommendation to everybody rather than bogged down in minutiae because we do not know they're just I mean who knows right ... ... is is this your way of suggesting that you smell a possible rat here that you're wondering whether this might be a hoax\n... and I do for this reason all of the suspects\nAre that are key hardy and our and truly do foment a violence and disruption of these other ones it's like they put their finger on the scale to say see you guys are it's one of the equation you guys are just as bad if\nNot a writer and then that would and that is the that's that's the the the big plus for the left lately is for a couple of days we're not talking about Mitch McConnell getting barked out at a restaurant we're not talking about crazy Maxine Waters are advocating a\nHooligan mistake made here we're talking about liberal victims and empathy is gathering properly I Would add for liberal targets of a terrible thing and that makes a lot of people go isn't this handy isn't the timing of curious so let me give voice to that you've done it let me substantiate it for you\nAnd if I can very humbly suggest how to walk around saying things that are responsible versus irresponsible right if you're walking around saying\nOh no this is a leftist hoax stop it stop it because you don't know anything about ... here's what I'm doing keeps me mentally healthy I offered his recommendation let the game come to you\nThere are you know how many investigators there on the story right now you know many people there are looking for who the person is behind these mysterious packages plenty\nI Am a massive fan of and believer in law enforcement I think we're going to have a suspect at some point probably sooner rather than later I told my local audience this morning I and be happy morning host here at six sixty am answering Dallas Fort Worth and I told them not tell you what I have no idea what to believe\nI uh I I absolutely field for anybody who receives a package like this it's scary it's terrible and should never happen to anybody\nBut before I go I'm presuming that what we have here is a real conservative counterpart to the baseball field shooting a crazy Democrat Bernie Sanders guys will go now we got our guy let's see what we got let's really see what we've\nGot because part of their hoaxes sometimes\nPeople grow all racist things at a university just to make people think they're terrible\n... at a university just to make people think they're a terrible racist or the university and then you find out it was black guys then it just it's just so we would go there's evil people either racist people university are are there are folks who your swastika up a synagogue\nAnd you'll find out that it's people who just wanted to spark sympathy for the synagogue and make people the Nazis are everywhere\nThis happens a watch now do we know this is the case here do we know that this is the left doing this\nIn order a false flag whatever you want to call it a hoax wherever you want to call it to divert attention from the terrible things that liberals are pre ... doing the leftist provable doing on camera\nIs necessarily games at a judge in Canada and an opportunity just to springboard this into waving a finger at Trump and blaming him for the whole thing is this just a sinister oaks do we know there's no we don't know anything in the God so stop pretending are saying that\nYou know that it is however is it okay for you to\nOf course it is is it okay for you to wait for actual facts to come in before jumping to the conclusion that everyone wants you to jump do you bet you can with my blessing and I told the audience this morning I Will believe that this is a right wing terrorist\nWould we have a right wing terrorists handcuffed and in custody until then\nGame on wide open anything's possible let the game come to me\nBecause I I have no idea what's going on here and either you authorities are going to work on it let's wait for them to do so right when Fort Worth more high Mark Davis in Larry how you doing\nGood\nI'm not going to talk about that if I if I ever had a comment about my carry on a you know I I watch a lot of people in the morning and stuff I don't you like a Fox yeah\nSure I thought it was like a conservative 'cause that would go why they're so bad that she said she lost her job\nRight now here's here's here's my thought it was just dumb for her to think that it's okay for white people to walk around a black face my dog knows that shot okay\nAnd the reason it's not okay is there was a really bad
