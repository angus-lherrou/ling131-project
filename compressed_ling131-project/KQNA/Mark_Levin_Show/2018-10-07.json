the\nKind of people that you want to be spending some quality time with\nWhile you were out of having a life today about what's going on the uh paid protesters there a heckling uh and then harassing Joe Manchin who is they ask Joe Manchin the Republican and waiting I Wonder if that is going to happen to have no idea but there Joe Manchin of course has been the most moderate Democrat in the Senate mentioned after being twenty sixteen election\nBut he wouldn't consider consider the up ...\nThe governor the Democratic governor of West Virginia ...\nSo the question is uh is mansion next maybe he wins reelection Aaron and he goes to add an end up let me think but are already till I was mentioning in the previous segment\nThat there's the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norm still apply\nDonald Trump being president of the United states not your typical president and the movement that he learned twenty sixteen not your typical movement which has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat could certainly aid the argument that we're in bits inflection point that things are different this is not your typical midterm election cycle to provide a a little more\nFrom election cycle to provide a a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it\nSomebody and I've never seen and again I'm a student of history and I'm a student of information\nAnd to the point age began in the Nineteen thirties\nInformation about what we've been interested in what we've been into their mid term elections since the late Nineteen thirties right\nNever once not ever\nHad the most important issue to the average voter ... in\nThe United States Supreme court\nIt's come up really high in presidential elections it was the number three is you an election day number three is you an election day twenty sixteen\nIs number one\nNumber one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind when they go to vote\nHowever their impassioned do vote\nWe are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change Kavanaugh gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe people are still ... motivated by because hey we could have other Supreme Court justices that come up here over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be seen\nBut we are seeing right now\nAnd some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before\nYou have the Supreme Court admission and then it goes to health care\nOK so after that a which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time\nAnd anytime that politics that people\nAre different the outcomes absolutely have the potential to be too\nSo as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent\nAnd that is the potential\nFor what could happen\nIf there were a red wave that came out of this\nIf you had seven percent\nThat moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress or maybe because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of a backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent\nI mentioned that in this entire cabin all brought this entire process from the day after he was nominated\nUntil today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent encompasses a bunch of elections across the country\nUsually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and when you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm bits and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote but you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history\nAnd you get out there and you're trying to make a difference\nBecause we do have a different landscape it's not all they are and the point in the in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you're in store for\nYou get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were paid and and shouting that Joe mansion it's going to winning hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycle so what are you going to do with it\nAnd uh by the way I Want to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely definitely should go ahead and hit on your DVR\nIf you don't already have in life liberty and live in the eastern Fox News channel

[laughter]\nThat was one of the moments where I ... my background is in financial analysis and business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years level they do\nUh but uh but the kind of work to be a little past that way and uh when I ended ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in various different algorithms and in formulas and figuring out that hey if we have history we have the information\nWe can do a lot of different things in in life with them or beyond just the financial markets for example so anyway ah good stuff pretty she had Raj\nLet's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\nGood afternoon you know the two things that that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was in motion only\nDisturbed and there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously saw sexual molestation but if it was\nBut we felt pity we didn't feel anger I have no Adam is towards the woman but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the debauchery that to the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to\nPrevent something that was normal within you know the process of the government and there should be some re ... from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animals towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted this is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalties not necessarily innocent victims like Dr ... who I really think she is\nBut the people who are behind that and directing it and in corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people are going to be punished\nI'm going to agree with all the Seventy five percent of your point you're I I Do want to ask you specifically you would say that the you're not angry at at Christine forward here\nDo you feel that ah she did anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nWell here's what we don't know we don't know what was said in her um sessions for therapy sessions I don't know that some therapist or some lawyer may have talk her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable\nMemories can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I I don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that I can see that she was used by people who didn't know enough I mean if if it was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein whether brought it out they won\nShe knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that the longer she waited the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it\nAnd putting the attorneys who hated Trump to begin with and in charge of it\nShe knew that was another lose situation ... as well as the war did she calculated wrong\nIt's interesting now you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting point I'd still can get paid or in in terms of having necessarily been ... into this mindset remember she's a professional in the field\nI I mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored in and memories are stored in the hippocampus was that they only won by the way when she pulled out they went seriously this is how you're attempting to establish your credibility as a witness was one of those moments where it's like okay [laughter]\nYou figure what part of the bird tactic is near\nA bus but anyway on you know I I still feel she's kind of like you go under oath you're involved in this process you say you're one hundred percent certain you provide all these witnesses and the thing that's odd to if she was going to end up being ... by you know I'm a psychologist but that these are the memories that you really had\nWhere was she of received all the names that she provided as the witnesses I mean that's typical for somebody who was a third party that wouldn't have been involved\nWitnesses I mean that's typical for somebody who was a third party that wouldn't have been involved\nIn that process to to instill in her I just can't quite get there but otherwise very compelling and are interesting thought All right I Am Brian mud

to deal with\nJust talking about the importance of supporting our bullies because of what goes on out there that's got a crab they were dealing with today in the capital as you have the the protesters and again from a political movement standpoint who doesn't want to be part of that\nWill leave ideology\nAnd by the wayside for a moment\nOne of the things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah\nThose people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that\nBe real for a mom and a lot of the folks in D.C are are ... ... they're paid these are folks who don't have live the rest of us we go to work we have lives and we uh you know they go about our business later the day and go oh okay that's what\nWe uh you know they go about our business letter of the day and go oh okay that's what the losers were up to today yes those are all the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more if they're willing to get arrested so yes they did they are those people but nevertheless\nJust in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating now\nUs to say much talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate that's going on for ever and a seemingly no resolution and so I but the other\nAspect of\nThat conversation that often is April ... ... refugees\nAnd I have long had\nMy focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal\nAnd the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot of was made\nThough it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nA lot was made that we ended up having the u._s. refugees in decades elite since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nAll according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand that weren't dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible\nNow here's one is often\nThe implications\nBe implications\nWhen are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we tried to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay you to bring the refugees into the United states ... tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies a typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks now you're ready to hear how much it cost to relocate a refugee into a state though if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks\nSo we could actually relocate\nTo only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now\nHow compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades\nThree point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that weren't skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody\nEver think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration and not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\nSomething that's never just got\nBack on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past your boss exactly that is it anywhere near the entire reason no\nBut it absolutely is part of the reason\nPeople automatically suggests that we have always fought the building\nAnd that kind of cost to import people in to compete against the most vulnerable in our society\nIf you're really cared about the most vulnerable in society\nYou give them the opportunity\nFor Donald Trump has been doing\nHis policy [noise] once again [noise]\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media [noise]\nTwo sides to stories one side of the fact I brought him on and so the gray one market will bear\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands\nIn back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief so he engage them after my God the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and the status currently\nNot collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on that thing I noticed by half until the IRS agreed to a deal that saved them thousands of resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks\nThat need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends would opt them a tax relief\nAnd uh let's see I I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer oh go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another police officer want to hear from you in\nAre you tonight hey doing well\nYou know I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been to\nFantastic just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement out for six years and\nIt's especially coming from my department you you just see a face to face 'cause we we're in a college town itself so\nI'm everything that the media puts out toward this they're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and are the folks who served with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in a again I Do the series down here in South Florida every week\nI Will tell you that there is a lot of support kind of like the silent majority that came out and made Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom the United states of America and twenty sixteen than at any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nOh I've been out there are a lot of good folks that that really do get to embed do support you know just Albany's and depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but the state's drawing and thank you guys were all you do or certainly is appreciated\nBy we'll switch gears go back to senator Collins and her big day Joe in Gainesville, Florida Joe go\n[noise] did you [noise]\nDo Europe [noise]\nAlright Joe you're you're you're up let's go to Glen in Springfield, Illinois\nGlenn go\nOut and Brian uh can you hear me good yeah we got you\nOkay hey thanks for taking my call and thank you for all that you know I'm I'm calling uh some central Illinois I'm I'm proud to say that Springfield is my home town that's where I'm calling from\nBut I'm I'm afraid to say I'm not proud that turban from my home town ... and uh I heard some of the comments that he made the other day a face to face to Brett Kavanaugh and I was appalled\nAh that's there's no uh respect there no uh uh no uh professional demeanor now and I think that Dick Durbin and and and I'm saying it I Want to his constituents Springfield, Illinois\nTake care of an old saying that apology and out and I I I credit senator college it's refreshing that she took the time to sit down with this man and get a one on one card I have a conversation with him I give her credit for that no doubt\nShe ... her find this moment and uh you're absolutely right about job and and all the others are named me how many politicians so we we started with Chuck Schumer today and\nBe Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation a line he\nBefore we heard for anything from from Christine Ford before we had any\nFacts present it said that he believes her and what\nHappened in this country in part\nBecause of people like Dick Durbin because of people like Chuck Schumer\nSaid that they believed her\nThat's all part of the damage that was done in this country\nGo to Anthony in New York Anthony go\nAnything how would you argue that very much for your for your great show\nI just wanted to say I'm finally proud of the Republicans I'm an independent but I'm really finally proud of the Republicans they started fighting back\nOr it looks like a karate kid number three hundred and sixty or where are you know Mr me I get trout goes out not to give or take a bath we had a had a fight back against the early age and the Democratic\nDefinitely didn't expect dish so they they they got there they got it handed to them so\nYou got an interesting take here\nThis is not something that's been advanced it at least in my presence before I'm I'm interested if you get your take you saying that potentially Donald Trump being Donald Trump may be provided the\nNecessary juice for Chuck Grassley to figure out that he's now washed job for Susan Collins ago holy cow I Do have the backbone for Lindsey Graham too I don't know it actually attempt to be Spartacus is that kind of what you're you're talking about here\nActually actually really because I mean if you remember when Trump Card every time every time you were saying everybody everybody would go hide under rocks\nAnd now they're all coming off fighting back and they're standing up and I mean it's amazing I mean I get Lisa Murkowski or pick that could be\nAnd then turn around and when I stepped in it but ah it's okay see I I actually I Hope she knows how to say welcome to Wal Mart once you get so once it gets thrown out of a not elected again so I thought that as far as the rest of them go finally proud of them are standing up and doing the right thing\nArguably Walmart deserves better but I appreciate that that's a really really compelling thought I'm a good call Anthony in New York there let's stay in New York for a moment let's go to Frank Frank spin extremely patient of Frank go\nYes or ... or I Would just like to say a lie and support or the confirmation of a justice Brett Kavanaugh but I just want to find out I I've been thinking about this the whole entire week what's wrong with these Democratic senators how\nCan they keep believing this for he's not from the\nFrom the lady uh but actually they actually don't know what the procedural issues are in in the Senate they don't understand what they're talking about when they're accusing of Brett Kavanaugh of things they have no actual physical evidence in regards to miss the cabinet had showed every bit of evidence he's proven where the timeframe where he's been\nAnd what he has done throughout his life and they continually for some reason\nTo believe that what they hear from this woman is actually true I'm not said whether it is or is it\nBut I Believe I'm Sorry up or Mr might I made five boroughs democratic where we're from the city of New York I have a different understanding of different things but I I feel very sad that these Democratic senators in Congress are confused in regards to\nWhat they're thinking feel about Brett Kavanaugh as a whole I think they should give this guy won the last ... and then we will see\nIf they were right and if they're wrong they should actually think about resigning\nInteresting a very interesting call their ... and I understand given your political disposition why you were inclined to travel down to bad they've given them one more chance\nMy mind on all of ultimately is a is a bit more uh maybe cynical which is you know it it's the by any means necessary and uh you know\nPolitics Trump's all a pun intended but I'm interested in I especially coming from a Democrat or to hear that on principle you think there comes a point and we're close to it to where these people should resign\nAll right uh I

Eighteen forties reading from a cold Mary who do it on line my total dot com again from a code Larry my next guest served as a senior economic adviser to President Trump during the twenty sixteen campaigning specialize in areas of\nReform regulation energy policy use a fellow with the Heritage Foundation the think tank in Washington DC please welcome back to the program is even more even have a\nGreat to be an hour you can be with you\nSteve and you heard that intro the gentleman that called me and and ... and demanded that I Apologize now that quote Trump is simply renegotiated NAFTA close to ...\nAnd this is a huge victory for Donald Trump I mean you know we've got a new NAFTA modernized now but by the way I I always thought now there was a pretty good thing I mean it it unified a North American continent or Canada Mexico and the United states and uh but it needed to be modernized there were a lot of things are in the mouth that\nThat were out of date and were unfair and you know Trump had a big victory here first got Mexico to sign on and then he ... you know tighten the screws on Canada\nAnd they made some real concessions here Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make but you know it was interesting because last Wednesday Donald Trump skinny they press conference\nAnd he said at the conference things are going very well with Canada and they don't come around and agree to some of our terms here we're going to have to you know go ahead with just with Mexico and I'll be out in the Cold War so I I Want to twenty five percent auto\nI wake up at six am on Monday morning and I heard the news that Canada has signed onto the green it's good for all three countries but no longer are they up to three hundred percent dairy tariffs felt this was a big win for our farmers um and and now they're sets up very nicely for\nUm for negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst abusers of the trade lives in on the planet one other quick thing Larry I was there yesterday at the rose garden when Donald Trump\nHas passed down from one of the points you made his he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with the tactic but boy is it working because these countries are reducing their cherished\nStephen Moore is my guest the economic advisor to President Trump during the twenty sixteen campaign even a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased um their economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of economics\nOf top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI you know and I told him I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually help now you're helped pass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally passed when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved the best of all worlds you know I my opinion we have a we have a a a a a a new\nA free trade agreement is now called the you asked them to see a we're not gonna call NAFTA any longer but it is a new a North American trade agreement that will open up orders a between all three countries or it has modernized because America has a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries\nOne of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage out another country right and that that's one of the things I don't like about this the also very it got me on that one that's not you know we would we want Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage I Would put a lot of Mexican workers out of out of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan\nA show I mean I agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this bill lower tariffs and barriers are up for that the candidate has imposed against us and lowest Harry's embarrassing barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just in just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as you know we talked about this on your show the war and more of what Americans producers called intellectual property we produce\nComputer software we've gotten some copyrights and and the technologies and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada or something and shortly China and and and then the other countries and Asian countries they just steal our intellectual property and this new I'm now ... very strongly that this new\nAh alcohol at the U.S she already has much better protections for not America's intellectual property so countries\nAre going to use our products they actually pay for them\nEven more is my guest he served as a top economic adviser to President Trump between sixteen campaign even you recall President Obama famously saying these jobs aren't coming back what magic wand does a president have what do you think people who felt that way feel right now about this deal\nWell first of all you know what what Obama was referring to is he said you know he can't get us to four percent economic growth and he can't bring manufacturing jobs in construction house back to this country and the cat bring coal jobs back and\nMaybe maybe Donald Trump those out of a magic wand because we do we do have a job since the election one million additional construction manufacturing and mining jobs\nAnd this happened Larry because of things you talk about every night on your show we lower the burden of taxation we lower the burden of regulation we allow companies to do their thing and got government off the back of our businesses\nAnd you know the twenty seven million small businessmen and women in this country
