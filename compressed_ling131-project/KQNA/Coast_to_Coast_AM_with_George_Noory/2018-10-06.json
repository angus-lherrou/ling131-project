I was listening earlier and I was just wanting to say um [noise] we just need to really mellow out too [laughter] I really do\nThere's there's just so much a negativity and so much pressure in the culture right now that I I think it's just feeding this kind of\nMass anxiety and maybe that's part of what what um you know I'll be talking about tonight with with the tower oh because uh\nUh tools like a tarot cards or believe it or not [laughter]\nUm are very very helpful for remembering who we are and I'm letting go of all of the\nPolice and programming constructions and opinions and\nA cultural biases and all of that it's it's a way of suspending all of that stuff and taking a deep breath\nAnd receiving um through images two pictures that come to us from a really a mysterious place nobody knows the origin of the terrible cards tell you the truth we know some things about it\nIt ultimately the tower is a mystery we know that it it it descends from ancient mystery schools and a ancient wisdom that yeah it has been called the perennial philosophy [noise]\nUm but there is something I'm universally relevant for everyone in the ...\nHow far back yeah we've been able to track the terrible\nUh Thirteen Ninety I Believe is the earliest evidence\nOr fourteen twenty is the first full deck that we know about any I Try and renaissance\nBut no one knows who the first desire was actually and I I really like that I think it's part of what tarot is ultimately it's it comes from the human imagination\nMaybe it was given to us from a Bob song\nUh from above or from beyond or or below [laughter] below\nOr within and you know I'm not arguing in psychology and so uh we van ... is the place that I look\nLet's explain to her all the people who probably knew what it looks like but they might not know exactly what it is right\n[noise] um it's a tool for self exploration it comes out of the Italian Renaissance um it's not it was not brought a to Europe by the gypsies is awesome ... misinformed\nOr actually the gypsies chain quite a bit after the first ... started to emerge in Italy and Spain um other places in Europe\nUm it is a deck of cards\nUm and uh in in some ways it's it's not clear which came first the playing cards at the ... actually if you think of a standard set of playing cards that is equivalent roughly to what's called\nThe minor are conduct of the Cairo\nThe terrible has an additional twenty two cards that is called the major are coming up and these are the cards um that people commonly uh think of when they think of Cairo cards you know they have they have the magician\nRyan gold card a fool and the wheel of fortune and things like that\nAnd that's your favorite car George\nYes it is [laughter] because I'm fascinated by\nIt I Know I Know you are\nAnd it is it is an extremely a beautiful card the scarred as is the devil card\nAnd the tower ... usually three cards which people think are the most uh uncomfortable cards at the major are coming up but every card in the ... as a positive and negative aspect\nUm and the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know it became very a cult oriented in the\nUh Nineteen and a early twentieth century in England with the society of the Golden Dawn and that's where the modern tarot really was birds with the weight jak the Arthur weight\nBack the writer weight tarot and what what uh what happened then was very exciting in the world of Jericho in that\nFor the first time the minor are caught I which are like playing cards a deck of playing cards each one of the tips or the miners are we're finally illustrated with rich\nDynamic pictures that tell a story before that time only the majors only the the pardon the expression Trump Card\nIn a way we're going to talk about that yes on the right\nBut I'm only those had pictures that you could actually just look at directly and get an impression of any kind of just kind of get a sense of what was going on there the miners before or the twentieth century um she's had geometric design\nSo if they're forced suits you know like my heart's clubs diamonds and what's the other one uh H. right those are equivalent to the ... the ... of\nA cops swords tentacles ... lawns and all of those minor cards just hadn't geometric shapes on them so if it was a seven of cops\nThere would be a just a picture of seven challenges on it say and that's all you had to go by now\nThere is a very rich and dynamic a image that goes with the meaning of that\n... a image that goes with the meaning of that card and um there are probably six or seven hundred ... a new and different ... today out on the market\nBut they all pretty much followed this the basic tarot convention showed that it doesn't really matter which jak you're using and some are very out there even my deck is pretty out there\nYou know the nine yeah you came up with your own new\nYes correct um but it's the same architect so you know the card is in the car has an image and the idea is that\nWith an archetype an archetype is virtually any exhaust trouble but it's only known through an image hurt archetypal image\nSo uh like Joseph cambell wrote a great book called the ah what is it called the ah ah can thousand names of the uh I Can't even remember what book I'm referring to put the idea is slate George a lawyer\nIn his late [laughter] I Love it though\n[laughter] but the the idea is dead uh every archetype like say the cherry edge or where are the hero here with a thousand with the housing faces or with whatever the name of that book is\nIndeed a illustrated and many many ways you know one image that describes an archetype so that lends itself to artistic interpretation so terrorists also originally interesting a\nVisual art and different tarot decks emphasize different aspects of the archetype but it's the same\nMarket type or the same a principal I'm In ... when we talk about the archetypes I'm In a union sent\n'em where with terror we're talking about a special group of archetypes and these are called what you own Carl you own the great a Swiss you know psychologists and philosopher center\nCalled the archetypes of transformation\nIran with a thousand cases that's not ... thank you thank you know this guy\nUm [noise] but it's it's the archetypes of transformation is what the major are kind of the ...\nThat means these are the images are the archetypes there are all about spiritual transformation and are not in a religious sense\nBut more in a sense of\nUm the uh the destiny of the human being the completion or the home is of um what it is to be a human being that is believed to actually to be hard wired into brain\nUm and that is true of evolution we have been\nA unconsciously are playing
