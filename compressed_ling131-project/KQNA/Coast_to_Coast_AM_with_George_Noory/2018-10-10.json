poor in your life seeing signs\nSo I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then it just one more thing um you know a while ago I had told me um you know the stair and saw actually different I I Believe and maybe in Iowa or some religions it's a body mind here at all\nAnd so I kind of think that what your home\nIs differentiating\nBetween the spirit or the saw the person is it's outside in the spirit inside or either or but um I I kind of think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the city what do you think\nIt thank you for your question on the um I tend to agree with the Georgia and there's an allergy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness\nAnd each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water so what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full of dissipating and the water does that leave the stream it just transitions into a different state\nAnd so the water to me is consciousness and consciousness is having this Friday of experiences whether localized in a world full or otherwise in the street\nDo you think that's consciousness\nIs a normal process of living for its supernatural\n\nThan the way I view consciousness is that it's like max plump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental regard matter as to rid of from consciousness meaning that\nConsciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow has this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to\nA leads to a very bleak outlook on life unless your brain's off it's over I mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness that does not die when the body dies because of the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish there had been taught me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review\nWhere they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain is either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted to during their life but this is the kicker that really I just think about this every day was that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected\nSo let's say Bob harm to change in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experience the pain through chains eyes and he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material goods\nSo it's when we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as the literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given lose gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness free cognition to love to see ... and things like\nThat well yeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have and the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's the subtle ability even ... than people who aren't trained\nI think there are abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book it's out so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have to rebel\nPotential and feasibility is that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science and our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into a what we do\nFirst time caller John and Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in goes UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was a cyber multinational unit two thousand six in Iraq\nBut by the way you for serving first night wearing case\nThat I was just trying to ask you every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker um we were able to use what I understand the remote viewing from a section of the free intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some buildings\nWere able to find that very UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in\nA ball and I believe it was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was the Israeli defense from what I can get a little I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American Pie gets association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there were ... there were great remote viewers all over the planet but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that consistent with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic isn't thing research widely enough to understand if there are certain trends or certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something when the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has Ariz outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and the access to water the outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir I'm sure you do or ... you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole show what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs because you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately with me only because of my background would be you know personal experience I a lot of things that I've dealt with by including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic will believe if you find the proof\n\n\n[noise]\nThat's carnivores

of the physical brain the physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we category\nAnd there are it's out there in these are I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nThat to me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we've discussed tonight a psychic phenomena like till after the cycle can he says pre cognition\nNear death experiences children with half life memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's suggested that consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the program\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show continues blessing you thinking as wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my uh my question is you can get other got tons of commerce or their reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us and the so they can consciousness moves on\nTo affect another human being good or evil I'll just free will play a part in for a fact consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nFree will have anything to do with a mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get that ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the ... body having free will are we talking about the the consciousness itself\nAnd if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is is consciousness\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infant it pretty well but at the level of perhaps that an individual that is considering itself to be separated from that consciousness\nOr at least appearing that way than perhaps the free world does not exist at the same level and that makes sense\nYeah it does ... on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concepts that we're talking about tonight I think are beyond what our linear human mind can't conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exists but what can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit us from understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and da da da da da da da and the ...\nI think there were probably people throughout history um who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might have interplay with consciousness but from the pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals\nWho really understood how things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe him against his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor\nAnd he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck\nHe has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt that the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in any shows on candy so if somebody goes in the Las Vegas\nSeat positive uh there's a high likelihood they're going to win\nBut if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy I think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nKnow I'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness then the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about of metal being that using the mind so who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality couldn't also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nHe says the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... Ah yes real quickly before all of my favorite I like the uh the spread of this ... minutes agree with a that aids is a bill above the effects of drugs is Bush in the fall and the mind or if you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mind I'm a you know as you the person speak him into a tape recorder as an example um you know that that example would be a consciousness\nAnd the play back of the tape recorder or you know if the typing wrinkles clinical those something will end up playing it just started a Moore's law you know distortion that would be an example of the drugs mind\nYou know it's not the consciousness but the fact of the apparatus that I'm bringing about a distortion cope with consciousness put in it\nSo it was not coming out and his two clarity that's you know of the wholesome of consciousness that went into it\nUh but anyway uh I think the prime example of a a spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf team so you have a the example of a active consciousness uh this week this thing outside of the body that\nUm you know a little ever paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't ah otherwise a delicate nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhen you think of mark\nSlow there are studies using on mediums people who can't communicate with the disease is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the ... Research Center\nAnd these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chant information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this subject thing that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\n... what do you think of some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think there is a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud\nI think there are some people that have real abilities and the wind bridge Research Center as one example where they they heavily screen the mediums and these people are able to do things you can explain\nI'm also looking back historically there are many cases back sometimes from the Eighteen hundreds\nOf people that were studied rigorously won his name's Mrs piper and she was studied by William James ... the famous psychologist and a detective solid her around to make sure that she couldn't get information from normal sources and ...\nTo make sure that she couldn't get information from normal sources and she was able to do things that were amazing so I think it's possible that some people have extraordinary abilities\nLet's go west Steven's with us in Eugene Oregon now Hi Stephen\nCould anything either joy\nAre always saying there's no such thing as coincidence right I'm I'm sitting here reading we reading a book I finished grad forty years ago in high school\nIn Wilson with mind power side uh-huh which sort of deals with a lot of these kinds of subjects injustice your gas in the last hour said towards psycho Kenney says oh my ... my eyes ... where the cost the page and read\nUs he adds this is the Iraq is a direct action of the mind upon matter\nNow what's going on here what is going on here I've spent my entire professional career as a working field scientists and natural resources soils plants trees all over this country so I'm well grounded in the materialistic asked parents of the world\nBroken belly heating and cooling\nFor the talk of the floods in eleventh hour game change you in a brigade rally Ninety nine point nine of them came to sixty me ...\n[noise] [noise]\nLong snooze on carbon Robert fear and dread in Florida as the strongest hurricane in the panhandle history is just hours away\nThis is a very dangerous life threatening hurricane\nSenior hurricane specialist jak seven at the national Hurricane Center that Michael has intensified into an extremely dangerous category for storm with one hundred and thirty mile an hour winds but the worst damage will likely come from the storm surge which may reach teens see in some areas all\nPreparations against like William falling major hurricane hurricane warning area should be rushed to completion including evacuation of whatever other precautions are necessary at this\nTime Michael expected to make landfall around lunchtime today and Canada the belt to become the second largest country to legalize marijuana\nAt least one hundred nine shops may open across Canada a week from today [noise]\nNice for making the talk of the quad cities take you into your choice for your early Wednesday sunny skies and just the winds today after and when I lost forty one expect type sixty fourth day in the press the plot so these are the high sixties due tomorrow and after an overnight long forty five and caught within the\nParty Dolly feisty of Seventy four and a high end Thursday of Seventy three I Know one role and that's ...

F. meters\nOn you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long on just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen where you would we'd better get on a new thing you know\nNo more than once really [laughter] yeah there's there's been a couple um\n... there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare there's still a nerve and\nYou know I mean one would say well I'm not afraid of anything that's you know he'll say but to me\nYou know you have to just keep aware and uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time has no joy if it's taking energy for me if it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all this uh\nYou know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could interfere and that's one thing I always have to kind of be aware of\nWhat would you choose the most fascinating to shoot them on\nTo do\nOh jeez fascinating um to me we investigated the Portsmouth White House um one time and there was a the last White House keeper his wife Carney small I Believe what's her name\nAnd to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't I wasn't in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects\nAnd it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer lose after we would have done and I was investigating she came through she was so excited she I channel surf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she could talk to the people around her but to me what really was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lot of times it's you know\n... century afraid that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that e channel though comes you know communicated with\n'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation\nUm and once we did that talk you know here's this woman ... small her pictures life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that I couldn't explain\nYou know that's kind of got to be emotional sometimes\nWhen you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at the gravestone and you actually think humans huge person who died and\nYou know ... means or right here in New Hampshire grossly parishioners attached to that that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\n\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um\nYou know and I've actually\nYou know you you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and sorrows and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nUm as much as you probably try to try to the ... ... you know you get involved in these things you do\nDefinitely don't you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so it's ... ... you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions won't if it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest thing you've come across strange you gauge\nThe strangest case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times he just he them all the time he would never tell me where we were going\nOn because it's the keep me honest right so I'm not Googling mind that information and they were for 'em so one day he gave me a call and say hey more rain you know I have this case that's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take us on our\nYou know ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm sure are on you\nKnow he's very creative right so I said\nOh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we'd go to this home it's just you know little ranch style house and we we get there and there's just\nMeant to guys there want 'em they just look really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like run I think his name was moose and the big big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so it was just looking at me and we get in this house and he said I think I have a little girl in here spirit and you look around and the mirrors a shattered glass table busted and it just looked like someone to the house with a bat\nUm it was just torn apart and they were terrified and he said you know they've my phone's been ringing with all the rules on it and my wallet went missing and now he's telling me all these things they kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm like okay well let's see we can pick up\nSo after a few minutes I'm thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel this you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting\nAdamant that you know it wasn't and I talked to use\nThem brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right um\nHe leaves Ron up at the top of the driveway with the guy who was any rags me down on the ball on the driveway and he looks and he said I Want you come back here tonight by yourself\nAnd I said well you know I really don't feel it's a little girl and you've got to be careful you know you don't want to welcome in something that you don't know is there and and he turned to me and he said look I just got out of\nJail for murdering my best friend and he said and I'm telling you right now that wouldn't be him and it's got to be a little girl and I want you here and I thought oh God I just

back to coast to coast let me tell you about our next guest Ron ...\nRon is the founder and lead investigator of the New England ghost project with a degree and environmental science now he was a skeptic however a near death experience changed all that for him no longer blinded by his skepticism\nHe uses scientific background now to seek the truth about the unusual in paranormal\nIn addition to hosting ghost chronicles on the ghost middle AdReview and I tunes he holds a weekly Internet radio show on talking that dot com and also has co written books with Maureen the ones I'm told him told you about more ghost chronicles\nAnd the ghost a de la ... good to talk with you good morning looking\nForward to this ah tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because ah I I had cut my a thing as a photo tables are and how much\nYeah well you know anyways uh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time\nSo they can to wrap them up and sing and kept me an emergency room to can bring a specialist on six and a half hours later they\nPut them all back together and ah you know if it was fine but during the night um my doctor came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and\nShe called in for a CAT scan actually had to bring you know the woman in the hospital was nobody at that time and they realized they had a plumber embolism\nAnd from then on things together happily [noise]\nAh well it was all going on I had what I Believe was a near death experience and it's not like the\nThe usual edgy here and and that it was I was just basically in a different place it was extremely\nBright white I guess it's the best way to describe it and the they were uh people their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they also white and ah [noise]\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was sounds really ... enjoy like music it had that ... type thing and uh\nAlso felt a man there's a line in the ... like a prayer that I always quote not as if like home with a very comfortable it was very warm\nAnd then the whole thing just be dissipated like the closing of an Irish\nAnd it was a law that break with us and it was just the jock or ah ICU that it was and then there was no music was just my feet on the morning there was nobody around and certainly wasn't that long\nSo I Would I got to the hospital I didn't know if it was a true experience or was it just the drugs they gave me so that's how I got I got into the paranormal\nWhen did you conclude that ah it wasn't just the drawings that there was something really unusual going on here for you\nYou know it's something you you just have to um what's the word I'm looking for ... ... they're really either believe it or not and uh\nSo I Know that I had this experience can I tell you it is absolutely a ... that the experience you know can I absolutely tell you it wasn't no so it's one of those mystery that that pushes me to the other things that I Do\nThey re attached the fingers were they able to\nDo yeah yeah well oddly enough and ah I'm going to cut off\nI cut the the mental and all of my left in the middle and totally off the the next to it I had several places it was\nA kind of dangling that and the top of the funding I head cut off completely uh they actually put a ... when they put together my ah middle hanging on so if I ever given anybody their finger I always tell them it's not me [noise]\nYou know 'cause it's possessed asking [laughter] that was a joke\n[laughter] ha ha ha at three thirty in the morning it's good\nSoldier to the hand works normally yes that's amazing\nYeah it's a you know what the time it's it's a little difficult with the cold but uh yeah it's probably\nNot tell us about the New England goes project that you started what the what is that\nIt's a a a power lot mogul was for um probably about Twenty years ago\nUm when I get the hospitals looking for something to do and a media one was off and of course and TV production of the time because of what's on the cast and it was all kinds of things so it looked interesting it was a thorough cause\nSo it looked interesting and it was a thorough cause but are not on the company that you had to do it on a a show on something and I still don't have this near death experience don't know if it was the drugs they gave me a lot and also I own a manufacturing company manufacturing company was supposed to be haunted by\nPeople that weren't there and uh you know that hurts all kinds of\n[noise] but anyways I end up so I said you know I'm going to do it\nOn goes as a lock and uh that's how it all started I went on my first ... TV shows slash investigation and ah I realize that we're a lot of things even though I have a good science background that I couldn't explain and I was curious and I'm curious I got them all I did it and eventually I\nBegan to doing it fulltime and you want that I Do think that they still not sure of all the things that happen what's real and what's not\nSo you got a degree and environmental science\nYeah you're on the moon program as well\nAre you interested in in in ... you were a skeptic but now you're a believer you've made the full circle how far are you on the other side that you believe this\nYou know I Believe there's something out here I Believe in an afterlife do I believe that everything I see and and\nIt's you know I'm always skeptical my my science spring I guess you wanna call it a\nOn my grounding brain always you know makes me to do what's going on and I've had a lot of unique experiences but or is it enough there that I Know that the experiences happened but are they really paranormal around the you know something else mentioned nation or something I just can't explain\nWhat keeps trying to you why do you keep doing this\nStuff\nThere's a lot of reasons to the primaries is to try to understand it more I Try to understand\nAll aspects of the ... just like going in as a you know well to give you an idea a when I first started doing this I thought that all mediums were shallow things like a gypsies it to the beach doing for what you're telling\nA when I met Marine I was pretty much the same category but I figured it couldn't hurt\nTo at least a try to understand what they are and who they are and what they do\nAnd uh so that's kind of my whole aspects of what I don't even know if I don't believe in anything\nI'm always open minded enough to at least try to understand if I'm going to criticize it I got to know as much as I can about it to do that so that's kinda how I Am more open minded but still it got that heavy skepticism\nWhat do you think of her abilities as as a medium\nA marine is is a very unique and I didn't know there are a lot of mediums out there and\nBut uh woodworking with her as she comes up with some amazing stuff in the inner trance channel like horses stills skills the crap out of most people who see it so yeah I you know I definitely she believes she is some type of ability\nYou run across a lot of people like her in what you do\nYou still deliver hits me lots of mediums lots of yeah\nI mean and we you know I also do a lot of studies for instance in the physical medium ship is it's something that's always fascinated me and in the cause for those who don't know there are two types of a medium ship mental mania ship or a disparate speaks supposedly speaks to the\nTo them like ... ... Whoopi Goldberg and that the movie ghost\nThat well that's a chance to meet him in and but uh that's still the disparate works through a medium versus a physical medium ship which the spirit comes into our around and actually moved stops for ... like the Patrick Swayze that same movie where they moved the ...\nThose pennies moving stuff right\nSo I I've been conducting a red light sentences or for the last four years to understand physical mania to see is what how much how valid isn't and what type of experiences and see if I can explain some of those experiences\nTake you in as quickly as been brought to you by preppy valley heating and cooling\nWhere they talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM cake you in a print the valley in Ninety nine point nine F.

[laughter]\nNot where they're making good chess moves\n[laughter] it's really the game has just started I wouldn't know\n[laughter] oh I'm highly undergoes\nI actually got myself I was like I'm\nI'm finished [laughter] zip now there's a little like\nA sound like Denise ... says of course Ron have you seen objects move when you've been on the case\nSo absolutely it of course I just told you earlier about the book that flew off the shelf but it's still oddly he says that there's a famous case of a a Boston sports writer who was friends with a wrestler by the name of ... who was the angel French angel or something like that\nAnd ah he used to play chess on all the time and eventually this this wrestling died and he had a a a death best mate or or or a buster is his head\nAnd he bought one of those electronic chess game which is so he's he like just so we continue playing but then he realized one day the ... thing was never plugged in\nAnd uh he actually called it a couple of people from the uh the at the University of ... in Boston and they couldn't explain that they moved to the bus the and everything and ah it would continue to make these moves even though it wasn't\nA plugged in and he swears that he believes that it was his friend the friend change will still playing chess with them in the afterlife\nHow many of these events in a entities are mischief makers as opposed to

talking demons versus a um you know ... you know that there are some spirit so that there are nasty and or to be quite honest with you or having a trance channeling channel is sometimes like Maureen can be a little\nA nerve wracking because uh there was some ... I actually don't like me and when you give them a body they for\nYou know they they use it sometimes she's drawn on line [noise] she's throwing me across the room before dislocated my finger and a couple of things so you know in the air it can be nasty but I I think the the most of them are really not\nWorry in not you've written about Ron having your back what does that mean exactly\nYeah no I haven't made that we've worked together for so many years on and in the beginning you know with us\nTogether for so many years on end in the beginning you know I started to transfer channel you know he tried to call me back meaning away you know whether you're weightless coming up for him army and what's going on you know it's getting too dangerous\nAnd you know it took us a little while to get that rhythm on where I Would talk to Iran and say you know in my mind I Know what I might appear to be out of control but in my mind\nI actually you know talking to the spirit or trying to you know to connect more or get into more of a what they're wanting and what's going on\nSo now I Know I Know that if I Need him to pull me out or to help me in a situation that's not safe on he's right there so that having my back and and then if not he'll kind of make sure people don't kind of touched me and go near me to allow me that space to do and I need to do\nLet's go to urban and know the state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing I\nLove your show um along because as a I live in a house gets to hundred and five years old\nAnd my cats I've had so many haunted experiences that I was just crazy it's actually kind of funny because\nI I ah really only have a nice bike hoping ice activity when I I'm trying to fix the house but Jay do something on the inside a one time we had gone I've been doing some\nYour ... the majority in the house and I come home and uh the there was a cop adore about three feet away from my stole that have been ripped off and driven down Mubarak left off though it was like sticking up\nOut of their seats\nAnd I'd go I'd go into my bedroom and take him to one of my TV stays drainage and you know that the guy and you kind of set up in front of the house you know if they can that set it off on my bed\nAnd I think I Want my wife and my kids have actually seen a chip and waging a I I actually had ever seen those but I ... I've heard like the death threats lambs darts\nSo you're pretty convincing them there\nOh there there is no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely my uh I guess my question is is why why it went up to do something to fix the house is that when they see as\nWily snake probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nAnd you are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best and it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually started thinking about\nNo question about that it's just amazing how many different kinds of entities are out there to do whatever they do summer fun summer having a good time other evil what decides whether they're good or bad to Ron in terms of that\nI think\nIt's it's who you are right and this this way for the funeral change you're pretty much who you are and the next life so if you have to deal with the court quarterly of there are some times\nWhen I um don't speak nicely to um as as some people like and but they don't deserve that respect it's it's you know if they're ah that'd be any annoying or being\nA offensive to to those who are in this realm now it's it's you know they don't deserve and they you know super respectable\nScooter Giovanni in Los Angeles her mode Giovanni\n... gone jarred well thanks I'm and I'm Glad to be back glad you got the coughing again truth thing\nA wrong Rene ... up there be careful with with uh with all the stuff that you guys are you know you guys are exploring with uh I Know it can be really dangerous\nI just wanted to share a little story of mine is really quick [noise] ah I ... truck driving right now but I I still do security from time to time\nOne of the places I'd security with our cat was a um a building called the malls they're building in here in downtown LA it's pretty old building if one of those buildings that kind of stood the test of time beautiful architecture and all that stuff\nBut um it's definitely ...

only a marine that our dear friend Jeff ... you're a forward to the ...\nOh yeah I just for a a yeah go way back he he was always been my mentor when I first went in to go so I think I went on the Web site on the Web which was new and that was the largest site on the schools village so that's a since then we've become really good friends\nJust technology continue to make ghost haunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better not better quicker there's ... there's a lot of um\nThings out there are some of them are really junk science but a\n... year I don't go I mean ... experience have been around for you know hundreds and hundreds of years\nAnd ah they didn't have a water technical stuff back then yet people still hate experiences though had great experiences and and seeing them and everything else I don't know we need to\nYou know it reminds me of you know all the physical meaning ship stuff the weeds you boards and those were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people want to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic devices that doing to\nThey're trying to get the goes to the deal directly with her and not have to go through a meeting or not have that you know almost on demand type of thing but if you I mean there are there are some\nUm\nBetter pieces equipment out there and there are some that that approach but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or are we going to I I Can't remember a record of\nMarine how 'bout you will technology you change things\nI don't know I honestly don't think that technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human beings you know and then what we can censor ourselves on and we may be getting close with some areas that they're they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime\nSoon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nAll right let's go to a final calls here let's go to lose he seems Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there or is that hurricane headed your way\nOut of the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this one\nOkay was friends with everybody else is going to do\nYeah I had a ghost story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida we were at the paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital in Plano against team which is known to be on it\nAnd why we were there a ghost this was in the middle of the night and it goes to actually made the table moved slightly up on the second floor so he went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the ghost wife Susan and I\nAnd some other people that were there and we eat any um any man flashlight on a table and that goes could answer our questions by making like blink\nAnd celery Afghan various questions and to some got it to indicate that his name was only and then it was a was had been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time during the Spanish period jeez\nYou know I think and up at the time my aunt am I in a briefcase with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year so I'm trying to time we'll hear clicking noises that goes for teasing me that he was an opening if we can\nI Love it no while\nI'm On my own opinion is I'm a yeah drop like a little I don't care for all of a chair or something last about I'm not last July but the one before that in the middle of the night having a little tiny bottle camp or something so I find it a chair and it's\nFun and like a high percentage speed poor\nWhy are they mischief makers Ron ... what are they trying to accomplish by pleading around like that\nSometimes the the just the tension seekers they they just want to be seen or heard other words that you know where I Am here pay attention to it if you have a a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that so uh you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to\nWhat you know they're there and have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut uh I have to tell a funny story about the a book I went to my next door neighbor and ... and the next day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said hey I take it back she says we were reading the uh the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nOh so she says I don't want anything to do with it it's like clash shattering books and the Germans and the other interesting thing to do anything really what they want to do I believe\nText into each time what do you have a swinging from Sarah in Rochester I'm curious to run we're Maureen can recommend ways to ... ... from coming to a person's life ... into someone's life let's give that to you Maureen\nOkay so I think even me with that are online [laughter] we'll get only rarely will get\nTo yeah I'm honestly I'm a big believer with the with St Michael so I Know for me there's a few things wanted intention if you know here I'm looking for that and you're believing that eagles coming in life and you know it's very possible that your credit invited in\nOn the other thing is I ... I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up spiritually issue things there it's already\nUm so what we're doing is we haven't St Michael's prayer card that I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have a different varying crystals around the room to how much energy\nOn and she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again that's in belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you believe in yourself as well on you can tend to\nHave a blackout block that out most time which you Ron what about it\nI I agree with it away and and you judge 'cause you talk\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge 'cause you talk about that the hurricane and your intentions sure make it yeah so and tensions as a hundred percent but being a good old\nCatholic Boy I rely on my religion the costs and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four down to two down to one in you know who's to sea prayer\nIs the cause but hey you know what it works\nYeah [laughter] I'm trying to be a hundred percent with the judge pick\nIn any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho ... west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead doing I'm going\nTo say first that are on I think we should all centered in our heart and intend to dissolve\nThe circuit and yeah I agree\n[noise] my my question is probably tomorrow ring I have a\nMan serving their land for the last six years here I feel is time for me to go back to the serving man [noise] attempted to move in April when I have a series of events that showed me\nThere was a time yet so my question is would it be time for me now to to move on and you\nDo a quick little

requests you know\nWait to get a lot of them be honest with you judge so uh yeah and you've got a screen on some house which is difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho and a marine go ahead\nAll right Carl bell actually called the ... a couple of kind and mine was aspiration pain you know ... to go after what you want right it's almost like a spiritual kind that you know you need

appreciate your perspective on this I\n... for my part I'm you know I I watched over the years as the United states of\nA sample diplomatic relations with China we opened our economy to China and I'm In two thousand ah we agreed to branch out into the world Trade Organization as you know all of that was done with the hope that as China\nIs trying to experience greater economic um liberty and economic prosperity that we would see a political liberty and and and freedom expand in China and\nAs I reflected in in my address last week um those hopes have gone on fulfill China has largely abandoned ... has largely abandoned or the the pathway of of more freedom they're building an unparalleled surveillance state even as we speak I recounted last week\nThe crackdown on religious freedom

the presidential campaign and the Russians\n[noise] well I Know the president has said that many times over um of leaders of the of the Senate investigation recently said that publicly and um I think what the American people are are coming to appreciate is what you wrote about in your opinion editorial little dirt earlier this week\nAnd that is that um this this president has been delivering on the promises that he made to the American people one after another an economy that's\nCreated more than four million new jobs of rebuilding our military a record number of conservatives appointed to
