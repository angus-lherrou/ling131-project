what I told you about is uh uh what your thoughts on the fog and San ... which are two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties\nUh I I absolutely love than has been a fan has them was a made on the weekend or the ... the kids who made fantastically smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot bands has them\nAnd um and when they when a cost to rally or you know took him almost a really long schedule I think it took him almost the whole year\nShould all the footage for the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and horror and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I kinda hearkens that sort of blend of fantasy psi phi and horror that you'd see\nIn a lotta later a Haiti's films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains a full time uh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barbaro great ghost story about um the lepers or a\nNineteen eighty come back for the gold\nThrough the fog or it's just so good you know are still many great performances how workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um Ronald pleasant but I don't know what he was doing at that time but\nYou know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John Carpenter so Halloween being one of them are they live being one of them\nThe fog was one of\nThem so I mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if there\nWere these inexpensive movies to make a [noise]\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm I think the great thing about a horror film um the beauty of a horror film is that you know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom New Hampshire right distribution absolutely\nSo so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the morning distinct it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the lesser the shark you see the more effective jobs was the last the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot to the ... it's very easy to over produced ... I think it's a horror movie has too much money and it\nIt seems protected you know you look the second Terminator movie you know it it it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need the cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it it's not like a surprise and and if he if he can he the train coming down the tracks no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think\nThat's why a lot of low budget horror films like not in the living dead for ... grand a are incredibly scary [noise] and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell have made a living doing lower budget horror film salmon thing\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier\nReally is [laughter]\nAnd uh you know and and I you know I got the interview him and he was charming guy and ah you know he uh he loves a you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes he likes the attention and likes the fan\nHe likes to check\nThe likes of paycheck absolutely you know and ah I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a chaplains know where it's just it's you just following through all of these kind of blows that they've created for him so it it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that poor type feeling for a pet cemetery and things like\nYeah I mean I live like Stephen King films a lot more than the books I I mean but I mean I'm a film\nBooks I I mean but I have a film and guy you know people always say oh well the book was better like they're\nNot exchange of commodities you know I mean down here to prevent a sculpture you know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I looked at a lot of my favorites Stephen King shop is all the short stories\nI think his novels or to a power outage too long when you know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man\nBut you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he start he just he just keeps writing he he's the justice surprised as we are because he just keeps writing and drinking and writing and finished you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done\nBut there is NO PLAN going here which I still allows for him to cry you know again there is no formula so I think that I think that that's why\nHis books are so surprising but I think at the same time you know a good director can kind of oil back down to it asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film a shining I think stand as one of the best pieces of art you know the twentieth century so I you know I don't know\nWhat about TV shows that are dealing with horror like the walking dead and things like that\nUh you know it's interesting 'cause you know I mean the walking dead I definitely I feel like owns everything in Idaho living and now it's kind of come down to the main stream I'm Down to the front line you know you go into the wall Mart and you see the\nYou know or the rubber ears the true hanging around your neck or the you know the whatever debt inside the signs and you know it it's all um\nIt's a very commercial\nUm you know I think that uh you know like a soap opera um and I think it's kind of cowboys and Indians to work that I'm In modern zombie movies you know I Know the army or the enemy that you can shoot and not feel so bad\nAnd we don't have a you know we're we're in the world of you know we're very politically correct world\nThere there are there aren't many a screen villains that you can kind of indiscriminately um shoot them mowed down with a God and and have no uh we you know a

having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I thank him very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I always tell people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually all of the world that's the whole interesting thing to

it's that's truly spectacular\nLearn how to download memory and preserve it on the porch and including your body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn who say hogwash life after death does not continue when we die down ... ... what are you saying\nWell I'm very respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe\nIs probably what we're gonna end up and ah so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in sort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in and you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the\nThe threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of\nThose things that seemed completely farfetched in the past\nAre now something that we can really start to grapple with\nWhen I made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is in use to use a skeptic the well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and and I use a nice guy yeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him\nAnd what was fascinating there were two things first\nOf all I he acknowledged that when his mom died he heard her voice and I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought was interesting acknowledge Mitt and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music and it was that radio and his wife was quite convinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he\nStarted to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of\nEntrenched position of skepticism\nOn what's important to was a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it was the dogma tests where the people who really understood anew and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they deny the existence of these things but they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than a bunker\nI Will tune I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the ...\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism as the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulses you\nGot to Maryland today with Israel took a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our ... our next hour we'll take phone calls about this would also want you when we

seven one four or five [noise]\n\nWe're we'll take your calls next hour with Dr Merrill Lynch Lutz all through the Dutch makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and the Marilyn would you tell us the story of the reincarnation of the little child\n[noise] [noise] well there's so many stories huts I'm just want him to step Bruce march or something like that right\nWell in Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience in the past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical report\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mall but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um he in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit a where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological source of evidence for reincarnation and these young people you know it's not absolutely evidence but are evidence shawl but it's still compelling\nIn our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had found it and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak\nRemembered being his grandfather and he would tell his dad what his dad was changing his diapers or I use to change your diapers\nAnd it was kind of shocking for these parents yeah sure and then this kid's started remembering\nOther things about the kind of car that he used to drive and so as a little testy a parent's got a bunch of pictures from the dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school\nAnd so this would be the child's grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then ah they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car and he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive a car and so again it's not\nDefinitive evidence that there is a kind of um a survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling ideas about what is possible\nThat it's truly remarkable in remember the study of the little boy who\nClaimed that he was World War two pilots and the new things about the plane went Atlanta too hard the tires would blow up in really nobody knew that other than the crew and the pilot and he was telling his parents this and they and they got a purified and\nUh they took him to a reunion a World War two veterans and uh she she knew several of the people from his unit it was an amazing story do you remember the case\nI'm I vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nHour right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle man's him and this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greed\nAnd say I'm ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirit\nBy looking at our gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody developed this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see her own reflection but\nBecause you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things and uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability\nUh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones\nAnd have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have and it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity to have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nUh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of her very special guests author researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black ... to do a lot of mystery and really strange\nUh-huh what do I want to be interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you were a mirror wondering how to get you in touch with her or her website is visionary living dot com you might be able to stream through\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is really not so much about what happens after but how those ideas and beliefs and form how we live now\nAnd you know we know that people uh believe different things even within a common culture a all we have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that people will justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence\nAnd while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rations rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence that's going to shape our beliefs\nBut what we see is that it's most often something else it's most often a personal direct experience something emotional or transformative and that's what really Shapes Our belief and then we just rationalize the rest of it in the name of objective data\nAbsolutely are supposed to go Dr Merrill Lynch ... we're talking about the really ... really was consciousness and the other side how many people who believe in a life after death also believe in God what do you think the percentage Maryland\n[noise] I think it's a tricky question I'm Corinne when when [laughter] I don't know that about ... George\n[noise] um I think that it really depends on what people believe going into it and what they defined God to be for example in um the Christian tradition\nThere can be a lot of fear of you know the afterlife because it can be met with you know I'm\n... while he was only a few ... of course\nRight hell and damnation ... can be very very scary whereas if you're coming from a Buddhist tradition\nWhere there isn't a God per se but\nThere's this idea of you know consciousness as the ground of all being so in a certain sense consciousness become God a that can be a much more\nUm a beautiful journey towards something that allows us a sense of safety and hope\nOptimism so I think you know those preconditions that shape what our culture tells us is true can very much influence how we think about the afterlife and how we hold our relationship to the divine\nYou talk about the denial above that so many people ... why do they wouldn't be a freedom\nI think we as human beings are hard wired to be afraid of uncertainty and because we don't definitively know it becomes a scary prospect and I think people will go to great extremes in order to buffer that terror that people have\nBeginnings quickly has been brought to you by birth rebel eating and going\nTo talk of the quad cities eleven thirty and teach you in a protein belly Ninety nine point nine MK two sixty ...

Durham and others at the Institute of neurotic sciences we're looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium as getting information that is accurate as compared to when it's inaccurate\nThere may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these medium for creating a space for another set of memories to come in\nI find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's there's all kinds of mysteries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nVery Houdini spent most of his life chasing do mediums wanting to try to communicate with his mother he was on successful [laughter]\nWell I think there's been a lot of fraud\nThere's been a lot in this direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so\nYou know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of formulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas was George\nEurope hello George junior high or just the vote was lost a lot of callers call and oh it was harder consciousness or\n... or humanities this didn't become a little or you know are we going the way it's going to be the only state of your\nFor everything we do and um the lady before a bottle and she showed up in the ballpark and mhm believing it is just so hard on the soul\n... pills work this all the new in this whole ... and I just want to hear her say Bob and I think you're doing so much I Love the show\nLike joy and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a palm oil\nAnd the guts I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies\nAnd I think that's extremely interesting\nI don't know and the answer to that question I I we evolving toward a higher consciousness or are we involving toward greater levels of complexity in technology but are more reality and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese and we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language on science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or\nYou know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have managed their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nReferences to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine a light on\nThat are trying to ... beats out over evil don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little ... that I'm a little um ...\nYeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort and if not people can just\nResort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the amid the law and the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions\nAre one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that uh we know as people grow older\nWas that ah we know as people grow older\nA there is this concern that we lose memory\nBut at the same time we gain wisdom so it's as though we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development\nIs as we grow older and we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAll right let's go to the first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead sure\nThere are no one's okay like I just wanted to call\nBecause I had this story that I had that uh\nI'd listen to the Maryland and I normally listen to all night and I'll ever have anything to say you know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one on while I was a kid I was hit by a truck when I was riding my bicycle and I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember\nGetting hit by the truck I remember hitting the ground and then the next memory I have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I looked down and I can see a circle of people around me weigh in on the ground\nAnd I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not a near death experience but it's definitely an out of body experience I Know that\nIn Maryland you had something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own instances of death and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity to move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the no wedding experience the organization of course named after one and ... sciences but what is the no wedding experienced me\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the difference between\nThe objective rational reason to kind of discourse and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we now but intuitively we know and that often can be the most reliable source of
