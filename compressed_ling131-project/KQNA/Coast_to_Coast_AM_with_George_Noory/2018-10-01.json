parents and I'm Glad I did but Steven read missing June twenty third Nineteen Ninety nine salmon ... trail head outside of Sandy, Oregon about seven miles southwest of Mount Hood\nAnd for people who don't know a lot of disappearances amount around Mount Hood that I've written about before he was twenty four years old he's an intellect\nSuper smart kid I was a third year medical student the reports come from a clock in this county sheriff\nAnd uh when he was twelve years old as a gift for his birthday he asked his parents for a book called Grey's Anatomy [laughter] kind of tells you where his head was that he knew he was he was going to be a doctor when he grew up\nYou graduated from Albion College with the ... biology degree five data cap is similar come loud\nIt was accepted at Wayne State medical school first year medical school he was granted internship to the Mayo Clinic in June of Nineteen Ninety nine at the end of a second here going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years and\nHe traveled to Oregon to check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure it's all the family wanted to see some wildlife\nMother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven on June nineteenth\nYou flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from rent Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostels checked in and pay cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paint Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow want for some reports state on June twentieth Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them say that he had arrived all was well\nChecked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and he was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles south east to Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the same in the wilderness\nAnd they stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in a little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there are ... worthless to don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers\nStevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early well the accident the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them\nAnd they felt so strongly that something was wrong if they call the sheriff\nAnd a deputy came out random registration on the rent Iraq in the vehicle came back register to a family and the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owns a car on the registration system and he left\nWell Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second the parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report\nAnd they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [laughter] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland\nAnd the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and I think that some assistance from the national guard Keenan since our teams\nSearchers face Wayne and wet conditions for many of the days but again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praised the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey say that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything\nEver dogs were later put into that area I never picked up a sense they um\nThey had a psychic approach them\nAnd the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail the game or a switch back look down the cliff they saw little TPP structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died search and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and the second is that you needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there\nAnd they are hoping ... said that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years not never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a search almost two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say\nThat Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park ... weeks left left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out now I say this that every conference and I said on every time on among with you\nPeople need to carry a purse to locate her because of cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there is no monthly service feet and get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out and I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied\nAre these cases could be quickly remedied everyone carry one of these\n... whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but I you know a church that starts that late\nYou don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um\nFirst of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers\nProbably wasn't dress for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if you've been ... George Will serve a map of the region but when you go in an area like this there are so many things that can happen\nI mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your like on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd I think that doesn't happen happen because it up and something very simple\nLike this country ruin your life when you could just have this little provides her cook your wife\nYou mentioned about the psychic that got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever in the end of the case where it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nStory is um\nThere's a remote here who's on coast to coast fairly frequently you will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd I asked him if he had ever found anybody and it gave me the name of the person that I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to him I contacted this victims wife I said hey that this person to help you finding your husband\nShe goes can't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on George I'm a guy that has a really open mind\nAnd I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and other remote viewing cases there was one guy did a card for with a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible now there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better\nBut as far as psychic I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychic owners roll\nUh a is outside area of the conference in\nTowards the end I walked down the road to introduce myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help worn out for sure yeah we could do the email each one of them the next week when I got back\nAnd I never got a response from one of them\nWe're talking with Dave ... about his newest book missing for one more land air or water Mardi Palan\nA pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week here's a part of his best\nEarly on that Monday morning and return states dropped him off at a location in Britain\nAt the super gas station at a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears corrupt pocket dial this wife while she was asleep in California and the wing the voicemail strange sound screaming paying growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human town or their animal found what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on dissident includes uh some of the clips from that phone calls so maybe we could play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\nIt's a male and like anything you ever heard before [noise]\nThere are two minutes' worth it [noise]\n\nVery little actual talking what are you concerned that disturbing neither one of the night call came from Henry McKay sell so it was labor date September Seventy two twenty eight in the morning negates worry why her and domestic ... household\nYou need to worry why her in domestic health minister admitting services is a nonprofit agency enacting mid ... the police in the Liberian community leader is trying to help the family made some rewarding\nYou know we're all trying to hide [noise]\nLittle like ... ... [noise]\n\nStation\nThere in silent didn't sound one either Henry or another person's head down and try to show and he\nWas\nBorn in ...\nAnd I'm like that now is in stark contrast to other articulate recordings that Medicaid speaking at an event he just state auditor\n\nIs one piece of evidence now do you believe that we're dealing differently cheat me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and boy did ... did she says the investigation should get here on Tuesday\n[noise]\nRight see which borders you know you and certainly all areas where McCain recording scene cell phones teams played since he's the only what is this whole series they have nothing in the\n... so that's a news report from Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report Dave that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of it have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it claimed up so tight\nBut one thing that I've written about and pass books is that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow last tower that they pick up that phone was near Silverlake road at Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nIn many cases I've written about in the past in missing from what I Want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy men\nThat were found and bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he was going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close well the location\nWhere he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canine teleconference ground teams everything\nOn November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon\nA kayaker was on Russia like one mile south east of the last time they can that phone and they saw body in the water and they recovered it there was no violence at all to the body according to the corner the termination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning\nSyria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water\nThat one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men was that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death\nAnd they paid for secondary autopsy several times when they did the second autopsy they've found very high levels of GHB in the system of the victim\nAnd they were in ... so high it didn't make sense\nSo GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people get it\nThey realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never have any of their friends relative et cetera seeing the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B canines couldn't track point to point a lot of times that happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia\nYou wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf they placed you on the water you would die by drowning knock from GHB and you see GHB it's not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by coroners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat are recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony\nAnd then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody else there that says stop it that's a that's a that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is and in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street he's on the phone with a girlfriend and his and says where are you I Need you here and now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found\nSo these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different but when you listen to the incident as it evolves\nGets very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped hum and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched by persons are known by things are known almost like\nNo one gigantic bird swooping down in matching them up you know so many more\nThan I raise is calling me all the time and saying well you know\nWe talked about the ... or so or John this YouTube say this this is what I don't say that\nAnd I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic\nBecause I'm not giving you any theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand this is that it's an unusual topic that's\nTo stand is is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat there are patterns say in this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at triangles including one that you're in Nevada right\nUnfortunately [laughter] yeah how did you ever heard of that\nYeah yeah there was a pretty famous a plane crash up in that area a Steve I'm trying to remember the name um see I think it is yeah they got a lot of attention a couple of years ago um\nYeah and that but ah but yeah that was\nThey they did a massive search for him then and there were some some weirdness that went along with that disappearances well when they eventually found him they said it was bad hair and et cetera but\nWere the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty ... valley and on Ninety nine point nine of them came to speak the meal

more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines and no people are going to want to talk to you a little bit to Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty\nOccurred on the island of mall if an island in Scotland fifty five years old I Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot we've spent fires and the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force a hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island a mall and there was a graph airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water\nIt arrived at the hotel on December twenty of\nOn December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the script and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly or the two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty gets locked out to the plane with a hotel guests name for the city Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay off the torch as soon as you can fly inland so she exits the plane\nPlaces the torches out in the field and she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water now some reports say\nThat after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said and it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they could never see where the white plant\nWill make a long story short getting in return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing\nAnd they found a sheep herders and ranchers that search all their property they got nothing well on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six it was about four months after the disappearance gifts his body are found on an oil\nThan an amount and it's like an oil near and dear field and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else\nAnd a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never sought now if given a jump from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones and they never found the plane [noise]\nNothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best every one could tell\nThe corner stayed at the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia\nIt the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia any gift that he probably died two hours after take off\nOr they examine his quoting and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means you can go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there really how long has he been dead where the plane\nAnd in my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain\nWhen people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die obviously the top of a mountain it's colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain it away as saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical um\nHow would you respond to those kinds of remarks and would fit here\nDoesn't seem to\nWell one of the things if I look for cases that are in some honorable meaning that explanation doesn't fit\nI have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile up close and personal left the house and it was Seventy degrees out later that night it got down to fifty but the personal left the house and they're in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone in there and a\nStack in the field happened multiple times also I've had other cases where a parent of\nMight be be couldn't take off their clothes\nSo if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because\nThe kids couldn't take off their clothes so the cases I Try to include try I Try to explain this rationally now there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the book you kind of stuff and that's fine\nBut the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happened\nYou know in the alien abduction field I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous or that where there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes run backwards or she was missing or um\nThey got somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing at switched when they wake up in the morning I'm now there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople clothing is found its kinda folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and it's not torn up as a by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books were special note were made that the clothing and the body with him packet bleak clean\nLike it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower and they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\nAnd you have cases where\nBodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they'd been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not whether there is not like they've they've been out in the in the open for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where did they go\nWell the same thing applies to the water related cases when one of bodies in water if there are certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair rink ring of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nCorners of made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days\nSo were they were if they'd been for all this time and that's important for behind finding a body especially of water\nBecause it shows things that he wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or a harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people\nIt needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something for a moment and some ... some of these people never come back at all and some are just ... guarded or when they're not needed anymore\nI mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body if not the case\nIf they are found on pretty much intact without a lot of injury to them I mean one of the things that people have said a lot is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the sole\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence ... what they're interested in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence it would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of of one of these incidents underway\nWe when we first started this trip together years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right it's got to be something mundane it may be some\nCrypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about we've come a long ways and I think if you start shutting the door to early you can't see really what may be obvious years later\nAnd that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say anything that you know may be a possibility 'cause it may cause that to work for me\nI mean I think even where we are today versus where I was six years ago that huge difference\nWe're talking with Dave ... missing for one one land air water in a moment I'm an open up the phone lines and you can ask Dave a couple of questions yourself we'll be right back\nName\n\nUm another lady um they ... they were and that generally smelled decaying flesh at certain points\nUm when yeah and they they tracked down their phones they could give it and\nUm you know I I don't know ... and it was three paintings on my cell phone into an excuse me one of them didn't make any sense to lay off to the left of the way you park your car it's not even way to travel with um anyhow um\nI just kind of thinking you know I've thought of what this could be and I was thinking maybe portals to another dimension\nUm big foot big slipped my the guy was within his brother had seen big foot a couple of times I've been there um family and I've seen a ship just twenty five feet above me\nAnd you also an underground he quit the naval base on their own land strange enough I'm On the back side of the nominated Jim creek on at all and you can\nAnd I don't know and it could have anything to do in this case or not but it's just they're all kind of strange things that I might even mentioning that phone call you guys had sounded like big ... big fights before\nWell do you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of stuff on there and get team's reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I I suspect that he's going to tell us that we don't have enough information to ah to assign it to any one of them but deep you can speak for yourself\nOr all quiet on one of those things are the cell phone hanging I wrote a about a case in Michigan\nFor several years ago and they crack this guy's song all over this area and according to the paintings and according to where it hit he would've had to have crossed a road multiple multiple times\nIn this pattern that he was supposedly tracked him and there was never any evidence he was in any of these areas and he was found deceased in an area probably where he should have been and where they were originally looking\nBut it just like this lady said the kings didn't make any sense it's probably more often than you here and everyone kind of just bought it off and says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe not that good there's some reason we're getting these paintings in these areas\nAnd it's disconcerting that they happen because and not only only throws off the search there's never an adequate explanation of how it got their\nFirst time caller Brent in Redding, California Hi Brent welcome to the program\nI thank you very much for taking my call what's on your mind to question for David ... you've talked about how ah people when they have come back\nThey haven't remembered anything that's happened to that so I wondered if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but there are somehow having their memory a race that that also you've talked about the German connection so I Wonder if you've ever looked into serious that the parents to Germany or perhaps they're more common there\n[noise] so German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the minds being a race but you have written about about problems that people have been remembering where they'd been\nCorrect and uh that's an obstacle especially with kids it's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep the memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that with the claims that and is willing to those are a lot of hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taking their very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking bay or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people over a quarter won't put it in the article or you know that's just the kids imagination to ...\nYou know is it or is it not\nOn the wild card line Carolyn North Carolina hello Carol\nMy I had a question at the end of their bodies\nThey have recovered have they have it done there aren't enough autopsies and all of a very very small\nMark said his needle mark or something that would be related to the tools of nanotechnology and I wanted to tell David to facts that I notice sure one and the U.S government since Nineteen eighty two has had\nThe ability to he'll make things invisible I Know that because a friend of mine\nA flu and experimental yet up to Washington DC over the White House and have the defense of gone undetected\nUm anyway\nWell that's interesting um there there is some work on the visibility cloaking ah devices and equipment and clothing even um we had that discussion on the program before if you've ever gotten into that topic they\nYou know I I think you are the ones that had the author of Comey Leto on right\nWell I I think you were the one that had the author of Comey read along right yeah that that had some some real interesting things as far as cooking and it's been brought up to me before that there's some belief out there that special forces have that ability\nAnd the practice when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that there is some kind of nanotechnology involved in any of these disappearances based on marks on the bodies that you've heard of\nSomeone corners do an autopsy they look for a needle marks that's one of the things that can be a contributing factor I doubt so they're looking for that but the first nanotechnology I don't know if they would be\nEast of the

called the creek it used to be a farming community back in the forties\nAnd earlier than had actually got anything I'm a yeah it was a farmer and his wife that with a had a rather large farm and Monday Night the animals in the barn veins and heck why it was really upset\nThe something anyway she went out and let them for what she found a box with two infants and they lose that six months so and they had their ... at the blanket one was named see one of his name ...\nBut anyway she took command and tried to find the parents or something like she never could so she adopted him and racism is their own and the boys went to school and to leave about Thirteen and then they dropped out of school because they live a board\nAnd they were searching and Kelly get everything in the hands on everything from plumbing electronics to mechanical and any of that um they um they they have been self like cattle by the way they are most completely ball and I had no hair on the body has all but they weren't outback battle diners\nAnd they worked around the farm and so forth and one on one guy there's a real severe cut on his arm and he goes to the hospital and uh they had to give them a blood transfusion site to give like type and he has his blood type was not even any light of it to them\nSo they get that gets brother and his twin brother and and you had the same type but anyway they were able to get she's 'em up sending back to the farm now\nSaid I'm filthy cabin as the ... it was a baby on the outskirts of this\nFall on is the great dismal swamp and they built the cabin on

Rockies Roger in Bellevue, Washington Hi Roger\n... is a thank you George or Mr now um I Want it to a related story to Mr ... is a about a\nMissing people uh in the Bellingham ah area of the Washington state\nUh the uh over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their a body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and a ... and since the during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of happening in a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and we figured that the you know that uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and ah and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if I'm Mr a prices are being aware of this a phenomenon of a\nOf the the issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized in newspapers and hand over there\nYou know what I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and ah you know if you wanted to try to contact and we have a\nWe have links on the coast to coast websites his website is candy I'm missing dot com that's where you reach a days like I Know he knows about the ... the story because it was a widely publicized but your son um what are the circumstances where did that happen and when\n... uh if it happened in Bellingham and it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened a and this happened two years ago October uh he uh\nHe had left home and uh we'd believed that may be there may have been some friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into this vehicle and evidently it ran out of cash and a and didn't have any money to get gas so he took off walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried calling his wife back and uh that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out and uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with a with a law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs yeah the drones are I mean they covered or that area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed up for it and so we were just show a broken over that uh and uh\nAnd since then uh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times\nI have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times to some of the people that they actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically a hell of a by the laws or the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh uh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so\nWhen I had read the Y. yeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David is brightest and she went to see what he thinks I\nI Would just you try that website that okay good at it but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass it on to Dave\nI'm that's a that's a rough story to to tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never goes away and the fact that you just don't know it was just a it was brutal\n... thank you Roger thanks for calling it will try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe\nHi George ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs for two national parks a glacier and canal in Alaska and one thing I Would say a specially looking at the rally the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes about my family that is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus no real hiking trail\nAnd if you go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be bad for hiking so\nI I Would say it and I would call a the ... glacier ah they really on the play chess how treacherous a trail ... for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trail that are like twenty miles trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can go wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and cutting proceed ah that I don't know anything could happen what the wild animals from the one thing now I don't think\nUh what's happening as as some sort of Charles ... group that are looking to just five isolated hikers and shopping with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout in Yellowstone for example I don't think\nThat people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker\nSo uh I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening uh but\nUh I I think what David Sanger about the national parks is that right well so profession people are\nAre you know there are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself a at a number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was [noise] and uh one more thing on that is my remote theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost\nRight on the ground myself what is it looked like something from Jurassic Park so I Do wonder if that some of them out right there is some sort of prehistoric bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory\nHum you know the idea that they're criminals in the national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know there are criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who are grow grow weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and uh you know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the day but database if we're talking about people who banish I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around uh that they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people that are hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain ... pretty much any of the cases that are a\nBoiled down and David books but a appreciate that thought or we're gonna take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines or we'll get to do as many of your calls as we can I noticed that a couple of folks have their own stories with the\nEncounters strange encounters in the woods and you know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um\nBut I can understand how the elements can ah can sort of clue and then on you a little bit and uh it it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the ah we're going to go to the break the ... taking them to the break and we'll be right back\n\n\n\nKnow anything about that car\nI don't know anything about that specific creature or a creature report but I Do know that the the ... area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time or the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah\nSpent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories from the locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least for the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe um things knowing people out of their sleeping bags at room rock lake thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um put this evening\nAre you guys were talking about a ... you were talking about this couldn't walk around right and uh and I literally stood up and said that they might point out the radio because I've read all the books I've read all the four one one of the books I've read the skin Walker ranch book\nAnd I've been calling this thing for some time but for several years\nA ... thing when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of disappearances a lot of this uh parents had happened on or near ritualized and at this couldn't walk her ranch that's on a rich like\nA C a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taking no one ever see them being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows whatever's somebody's on the property or on around it's just to me I I'm just saying to me or that in my opinion I think that you know the the skin Walker ranch uh\nIs very close to close the the phenomenon turn around and go for one more\nWell I you know I think there are some similarities and that then it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do it themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have built up here but not critical\nYou know there has not been any people are saying but there's been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know the thing that doesn't fit there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of a gouge marks on them either than scrapes with things like that no no kind of like pro being or or something of an alien would do and you read the auction stories and things like that\nThat that that doesn't fit but as far as a rich lines go um and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate or no one ever sees sees that uh that that to me is uh some good strong march there\nBut thanks thanks for sharing your impressions with is that a lot to chew on ... you calling in we're going to go to the wild card line Mario in San Antonio Texas or he has his id he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome Georgia and have a ticket for taking my call I wanted to be my experience uh the sheer at a parking signs on your own which they added another channel miles supply trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd um this wooded area where even do with daylight at the time almost literally meaning of life where they don't fight going down the trail of course I was a little ahead over and uh we've got started in one area where it got kind of dark even do with daylight but it was so would it that it was\nThe sun was shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of dark in that area and when I stopped to see what my library that I noticed some kind of something just staring at us and it was like that on on a stomp it looks more like a bird\nBut ah you know you never know I mean it's kind of felt like it was like\nAnd just stay on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something Cheetos and we've kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that and she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw it in fact going to be flying away but the wingspan with soldiers arch there wasn't a\nIt was like a regular bird you know I mean we have dogs and a girl is sending all kinds of stuff that I'm a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parks where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is\nAnd so I just want to share my story 'cause I Know we didn't record it to know pop stores or any ... rangers or anything\nBut why don't we didn't have no evidence is too it's kinda hard to believe that there could be that big and we were just two people that just riding a bike than a\n[noise] a down some kind of Florida bought something that we just saw\nSo ah you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on the animal are\nAll you saw was kind of like a maybe something going on his eyes kind of like blowing just like if you just see a beer in the dark school law or something like that you knew staring at you when you can just see a ... like a form of shape\nBut you could really chilling exact details especially when there wasn't that this that and I think the

goes back to Arkansas I kind of er twenty four\nJohn first off let's understand why we had to have this hearing\nMiss foreign made these allegations and accomplish will let her die Feinstein in July shortly after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated\nThe very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader said that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happening for three months the Democrats have turned advise and consent process into a search and destroy mission these allegations are completely supportive my any evidence what evidence there is to eight thirty six year old climb\nAll support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgraced this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh their argument of course was that soccer for an ass to have this housing confidentiality and then they tried to do that\nAnd that's what it was what let me let me I don't know no no no no John let me talk\nYears what's ... I don't know no no no no John let me talk to you about that when I talk to your listeners about your views about that\nThere is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee Dianne Feinstein could have showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted this inquiry in July and August without trying to sports confidence it and they have a trainer they pointed her lawyers\nWho Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge\nThose lawyers gonna have to face in DC more investigation into the miss their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face

five\nJohn any impact this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault John encourage them all to do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respect her request for confidentiality smell when you come forward with an accusation of serious that as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence and against proof and we would have known that\nConfidentially inside the new share committee wasting its time\nAnd I don't know what I don't know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found that the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that missed one sided interview miss Ford and judge Kavanaugh for six hours after tai chi and send them a letter that wasn't an interview but you're not right about that\nSo they've either interview them or they receive letters under penalty of perjury I sat for nowadays are actual

already know what everyone who's alleged to be at the party\nHas said they've submitted statements or been interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change her statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is very highly qualified nomination in\nIn the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was that may end up as a good students cannot truthful and everything he said in his testimony I found him to be truthful around this testimony I found them
