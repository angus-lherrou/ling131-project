California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir hampering grind work that you're doing ... pray my question Nick and pop out or\nQuestion Nick hands about war and the battle field and more sounds\nHow does military personnel men and women in a battle situation protect themselves from\nThe Monica solved I'm not talking about just battling insurgents cycling but there must be a lot of demonic energies\nIn a wartime battle field situation\nAnd do you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are messages through our rules on the other side\nOf emotional energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a\nA place where negative ... attracted to demonic spirits negative spirit says well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules\nSo there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects that negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us were just natural in a battle situation\nUh emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield\nThere are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work\nSo that negative energy actually bounces off of us [laughter] this is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple\nAnd it can take this stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds you need it fast you know the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all of that stuff when I got out of the service ten minutes of the morning and ten minutes and the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us\nWe need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the book killing and and also also ... off the fear\nAnd so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing\nAnd it's a science it's not a religion what I what I'm involved in is not religion I Would not even to say it's really a metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say scientist or not call me up and argue with me they are right I deal with non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body\nAre emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack and also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy a person's life a hack the fabric of the family in the best way to do it is to pull out the resources the money George to get it out\nIf they destroyed a business and they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home that can cause people to lose their place or where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violent Lee and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have a failed business I think most restaurants they fail within a year so restaurant after restaurant comes in her business after business comes in\nAnd you have problem is a field dismisses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well plus you have all the people working uh who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we're a family at home\nAnd we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along and so essentially have a lot of emotional energy\nPeople at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here we're doing that they're generating emotional energy and it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes as negative and it accumulates in the environment\nThis also attracts negative spirits and demonic spirits because if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something uh you know inappropriate more\nUh you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making them uh the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally\nEverybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nA business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what they're picking up on George is emotional energy whether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on everybody has a story of that this place doesn't feel right it's emotional energy and it needs to be clear it out\nSo they attacked businesses because they can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids and a and then it just snowballs\nNext stop let's go the Monique in sun ... son ... California Hi Monique go ahead\n...

Rome or are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flood and then continued with new bloodlines after the time of the flood\nThe second viewpoint is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings light being ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies\nAnd face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status\nAnd then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me when\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who are called them to feel them as these giant beings with the long gated skulls and in this whole axis of research which is very interesting\nBut if you're following that path\nChances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax left by the scenes and you're realizing that the the uh seems themselves were utilizing ancient tax and teachings that they had developed in synthesized from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the address\nThat were centered on how do we contact the watchers\nOne and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about this this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years before the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings\nTo congregate with the angels the holy ones the angel of the lord the watchers and work transforming their bodies\nInto light in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the morality of the ... the meaning of the word ... it's far far from established fact the term fallen angel is ... means that the are evil beings or that they are being too or are somehow demonic\nThey their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will have an ally realms\nAnd took human body fat is they're great sin they crossed what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flash into spirit with out God's permission\nAnd this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they descended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality\n[laughter]\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others\nSimply decided that they were demonic beans that they were a powers that were beyond human control\nAnd certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission\nBecause in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experienced the rapture you have to be invited by God and that's the great crossing a line that the watchers\nTranscended are crossed over and came to teach humans how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch is you do talk about a luminous clouds were gods rude on them to me it sounds like CSI keels we'll it sounds kind of you will\nLike CSI kills we'll it sounds kind of you and foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds as new field which is the ... where we get the word and a feeling from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book in in the watchers book I collected\nVarious examples of Judeo Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus riding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds they're literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol for their ascension body they're light oddity it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota\nIt's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered mentioned only and throughout the cosmos\nArguing with William Henry whose lives were still watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative menthol it just goes\nAfter these gone a visited a spiritual or physical\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their bodies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to the stories\nTransform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the non stick taxed as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of eyes they're covered with feathers and they have certain teams type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches with the Tibetans describe as the rainbow body of light\nIn the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are the the our body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails\nAnd have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers\nAnd so these watchers could could step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency manifest in physical form and then face back into their non physical light being for well\nWhat did they want William was there an agenda\nIn my view when you follow the ascension path of of the watchers that they were here they came here in on a on a rescue mission they are the on an ... by the way they were not here for gold that that is ...

the the outage story actually is now old as it turns out that the uh the root zone key finding key the care okay uh that was updated for the first time since the theater security system was

with the the thing about the security system has not been widely deployed to end users it's mostly the big I have a big corporations and things like that it's gradually spreading more\nFor their concerns that not everybody especially not all of the all the ISPs would fairly have made the right preparation for this that there could be disruptive\nBut it was very carefully planned out in practice what happened is they they the roll over a yesterday yesterday afternoon I guess there were I guess if you're a little bit here and there but they were ready for that they uh they fix them

specializes in the clearing the individual homes businesses a psychic protection\nJeffrey is also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such as we were in ... as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks stores for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planet\nSoup or you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring out ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individuals and the media pay a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAre also in tradition that um it's harvest time and ah in the tradition of that but there's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing that I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pay more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever using demonic spirits are more get into what do you think they are but\nDo you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight and you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits have something to do with that\nDefinitely uh we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirit and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those who are as we go along\nBut absolutely targets on the back of people that have power and can change the world for good or for ill and uh I think that there has never been a time in our history where demons\nHave a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too and so let's get your take Jeffrey on what is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nA demonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels that powerful\nThey are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things\nThey've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful\nAnd there are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh\nWe're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nNot going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the pack of ah demonic spirits\nNegative spirits and ah\nSpirits are are able to reach in to the cold around from the non physical route and actually produce coal effect and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit and a negative spirit\nAlso demonic spirits are are much better\nSpirits are are much better equipped to influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trans\nFor information into our system or emotional system let's make us angry at each other other people at ourselves to get us to do things we would not normally do\nAnd we can see that we don't know that there are there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirit\nIt's also true that a demonic spirits a can change you know once they were you know positive spirit and the ego got for them and\nNow that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack of so many arguments you know between people today\nAnd they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirits do not have voiced boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate ... ethically is kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness\nAnd they communicate on that level and whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common\nAnd uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do violent things hurt\nOur significant others wires husband as people\nAre not all of violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they're around more than ever and sore negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative things when they were alive and continue to do negative things but demonic spirits are very powerful and as an extra ... when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can come and get you\nGo out and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect that when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes negative feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt\nIt doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nSeven years now\nBut it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration than it is very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nCan you see them I can you\n... I was born with the ability to see spirits\nI thought everybody could it was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirit in the classroom so\nWe're standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them schoolwork and some are looking at me like how can you see me what are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for me to actually come\nAnd started walking towards me in the classroom when I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey and

with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race\nA natural human the human they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits\nI can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so ah they attack children in their cribs\nThe ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that uh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand what they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that and how they wouldn't make straight movies no problem with that but\nThe reality is is that they are around us spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicated with us tell a path to either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroy their family\nDestroy their lives and also ... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they want to sell\nThey sure do ...\nAnd we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying that it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of a story of ah being in a home apartment condo a party a barring a pub any ... any place\nWhere the scene or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy\nSomething that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy\nAnd that can influence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling so\nIt takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that\nI Would not normally do that mhm and some of them were angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world\nThey work on them or they don't know that there are there and they may not believe in them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer\nOr not and so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and get us to do things that you would not normally do\nDemonic spirits are just experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make out of non physical energy is just like spirits do\nSpirits changed their forms like our our parents die and it's an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating in thinking about generating\nA form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see making spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level\nEmotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well\nSo demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely wrong or the under the direction of the devil Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of following negative spirits I the spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule\nOr they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time working on individuals and families are getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other\nGetting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage and they're very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally\nUh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative a beam of light all come out on attack I pull out my non physical stored they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody is not so fortunate the vacancy them and know that they're coming and so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home\nUs and we don't know it around us that work and at home also negative spirit you know and in negative spirits can work for them essentially and in sort of modeled themselves after that and\nLike I said most people are good in summer or not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die all the time and lots of them are not good\nUh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack\nPeople on a daily basis so\nEssentially the entire human race right now is under attack by negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier\nMay not have ever lived in the physical realm or for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged\nAnd they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura and to get us to react\nTo they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible they have they just have humans and so they attack everybody they attack\nPeople least able to defend themselves and their world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other because we're being used and it's not just\nYou know I heard some talk on the commercials about global elitist and all of that and I think that's true but also we're being attacked by non physical entities\nThat wish to see the human race failed and it was a possibility that that could happen it's a very serious
