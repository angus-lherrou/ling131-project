important to understand about the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the experts the of the state department diplomats and everyone has been using a formula\nWas asked um you know it'll that\nThe Israelis and the Palestinians can be ... and negotiate a peace like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed the state of Israel was um ... created\nThe Israelis DNA dictates the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of\nUm he won't Juma moment of raising the flag where they

there I found a busy rail and look at the American blood it's been spilled over there over the decades\nAnd it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is a wish William Buckley this is the

she got the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nA man or keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\n[noise] sure a good question Brian uh the answer your question is uh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all of this personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country ace up\nOr they had to shut down or their source network a and\nAnticipate the entire source chain that that had been compromised their\nUh they had to shut down safe houses uh where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill uh had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets\nAnd so here you have a uh the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon\nThat have access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the Iranian intelligence service for example a Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say of the Russian KGB at the time [noise]\nSo those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario and you shut down everything so ah was ah operations

the first story in the book uh back in World War one um the British\nA ... a British soldiers also with the law to Australia and New Zealand soldiers and invaded or a pod of turkey turkey was an ally of Germany so\nThey said that invasion force a down that turkey they landed in Beijing for us and it just really gets stuck on the beach and it was just she really horrible just a a ... there were a lot of spotted in World War one but this was like\nJust a really really a massive wanted um Mel Gibson sat in a movie\nCalled ... that you know it's just heartbreaking how all these people died there well anyway there was a um\nA company of a hundred soldiers called the ... and they were actually made up of service from eight largest state in England and they have trained together they went over to um a fight the Germans together and they were part of this invasion\nAnd really all it was was just a troops just marching into a murderous a machine gun fire anyway this company of soldiers British soldiers just went in to the smoke\nAnd would never seen again a dead bodies were never recovered she\nUm the um during this part of what they did and you know sometimes take these truths was where they would let people in both sides take their dead and wounded off the battlefield but no one ever found the bodies of these a hundred guys and even in the pressure was in charge of the British commander in chief said you know he he could never figure out exactly what happened\n... what do you think happened\nI don't know who knows you know it's ... it's just very unusual that none of these none of these soldiers from this particular unit that one's getting their bodies are never found no remains fond of them are they literally disappeared during a major battle\nWe've got a guess named David ladies max that has written a book called missing for one one several other books after that more people disappear in our park systems never to be seen in many cases some of them some of them they do find their bodies but they're very strange circumstances but\nI sometimes wonder if there's some kind of dimension or Portugal or something that people stumble through and they're gone\nOr something I I Know in some of those four and one of the stories and national parks you know people have to pay like jogging and one goes round the bend and then they never see 'em again you know it it it's something that happens immediately a very scary very interesting story says well\nA little situation just two months ago with the little boy from Louisiana who the fathers said I mean a little kid and he ran away and he couldn't keep up with them and they found the kid the several days later you know dead by creek I mean just strange stories\nYeah really yeah yeah creepy\nWhat am I England phantom Tom what's that\nWhile this was one you know we we really kind of had to look into this one because\nUm there is of up until a few years ago if you went on a go go off you looked in any kind of a phone book or whatever and I'm\nWest blanket ... England area ah you saw that there was a town there called adult I had everything had its own post office and edits on newspaper and you know had a job section or real estate company there is even a dating service there but it turns out that this this time never existed\nUm anyone who went to the land caught it given to\nYou on a Google Map they would just find an empty field\nNo one really knows exactly what happened a one newspaper said that Google and the people who supplied mapping data you know unable to explain you know why they had this town on that map is but when you actually go to the place\nIt's not they're not in the book you know we we we really can't you know figure out what is going on there you know there's no you will follow activity near the place a military activity but one person published a what better place for government to hide secrets then at that time that never existed\nUm it seems to be some kind of a\nDrill or some kind of out of you know for some reason maybe some intelligence services want to know what it's like to create a phantom time well they did it in the middle of England\nThat's weird isn't it yeah it sure is in a\nNew strain stories like that all the time you were talking about your photos that you've never seen one that I saw a couple with night vision goggles in your opinion based on your research where some of the best places in the United states to spot you muscles\nUh-huh well you know it's funny I'm there there's let's say a top three or four but one of them is a place called elk river Minnesota and there's nothing really\nMinnesota and there's nothing really you know extraordinary about this place except uh starting a few years ago people started seeing your phone is almost on a daily all let's say a nightly basis\nAnd uh it's just a small community it's it's no more friends fishing and yeah and I'm\nA scheme and a than anything else but what's strange about it is not only do people see\nYou oppose frequently there but they're not your typical you a photo of some of them look like um well one person said that uh they saw one that you know it looked like a huge jellyfish or others look like you know just very lied you reach\nA some of the size of a a line on some of them are you know small was basketball's\nBut for whatever reason there's they want to congregate around a little elk river Minnesota that's one place\nOr another interesting places Stephenville, Texas which is down near where\nI draw W Bush's ranch is that and there was a major citing down there years ago and in two thousand and eight where some people saw\nA UFO being chased by have sixteen fighters or Airforce fight as other people saw a ... being escorted by F. sixteen fighters and it happened right near where rod George Bush's ranchers and apparently you know down in that part of Texas\nIf you keep your eyes open and go out at night and maybe get those night vision goggles you could see a lots of different things\nTo his ranch in anything to do what they were the only one\nI have a pet I don't know I think the whole idea that some of the witnesses they had a lot of witnesses and um some of them thought that they are our fighters were chasing the UFO but then other people swear they that they saw them playing alongside of like they were asked according I I'm In just the fact that it was his ranch you know\nWho knows but um you know that's that's ... ... it's still today as a place where if you want to take the time to get down there are people see you all falls on a regular basis Gulf breeze Florida which had a um\nA controversy many years ago where a guy named Edwin ... came up with lots of photographs very detail photograph the\nReal story ...\nAnd ... and then you know I have some people went to great lengths to prove or in their minds any way that you know these were hoaxes but the strange thing is is that\nPeople still get down there that people still see odd things in the sky and they still take pictures of them and they're still detail than almost looked like the ones that day had Walters had so\nUm what is going to whatever it was flying around up there you know there's a good chance you're going to see it if you get down and go freeze\nWhat's your best celebrity you most\n[noise] well [noise] um it has to be a that William Shatner\nOr because you know he's

thirty degrees already had no water or any set a mysterious object\nAppeared overhead and guided him to a gas station\nUm but later on in his autobiography he ... he came to the story does

I'm\nTaking believing camping with his girlfriend Marianne unfaithful Nineteen sixty eight and had a very vivid I'm a UFO signing so much so that yet his ah\nEnglish estate he actually installed the

eating\nRight you know it's it's just it's this idea that ... and yet it's been bouncing around for years is that you know we as the you know the population of this planet won't be able to handle the truth that there may be you know being some other worlds out there\nAnd maybe visiting us I Know the wheels Winston Churchill during World War two someone gave him a very detailed photographs of what they called foo fighters back down but the UFOs\nIn Egypt not want that released to the release\nYeah that's right because he he thought all religion would fail but that was his reason that you know while religion as a base you don't run based in if we find out that you know we're not the only ones in the universe\nIt puts some new questions on um a lot of the major religions so you know can we not handle it I don't believe that I think they were the vast majority of people on this or I\nWant to know what's going on and want would like to know that there are other being's out there you know it's one thing at once again it would be like the greatest story it in and all of history why they keep it from us so that's just if they know what these things Iran that keeping that a nation from us

that they saw something during the military service or were told by higher offices never to talk about it and to tell anybody about it and they actually say things like you know your your pension benefits so you know to spend it if you're\nTalking about these things I Know pick up my own family with all these things you know and what we would like to see some kind of you know and the state for these people you know to have the Pentagon and say okay if anyone was threatened not to talk about UFOs\nYou have a blanket amnesty go out and talk you mentioned the tidal wave of new research that we get to do when all these veterans felt free to talk about their experiences um\nYou know maybe some day that would happen or who knows but we do hear that story over and over the top of the very odd happened to people during the military service having to do what you're up close and they were basically threatened did not talking about\nYou know the old men in black situation ... did you come across anything like that and your work\nWell you know once again just suddenly the stories you know of the fifties and sixties and you know there's actually two kinds of men in black as it turns out they were there are some who\nDon't even from the witnesses what the witnesses described as they they don't even seem like they're you know from this earth and that kind of clueless about yoga that acts socially and so on um [noise] they don't really look like us they were in\nThat setting you know black clothes but then there are other people who said the men in black and they're obviously some kind of you know from some kind of intelligence\nUnit or sent them to either investigate or to scare people into silence or whatever but once again you know they they have to be out there because everyone runs into them they can't be making it up they can't be just playing out in\nThe book is called Mack Maloney taunted universe where do you get the book Mac\nOr Amazon dot com it's a noble dot

Charles in ... Texas hey Charles welcome to the program\n\nIf the if he had had the um [noise] a knowledge of a he had become aware of anything related to where some of this technology that we require UFOs has been a\nYou know what the clustered and a protected because at one time I was asked\nOn myself was asked that I probably would help a destroy it there are some people in the military\nUm fortunately that tend to believe this technology is the ... and they want to they want to destroy it I mean it is it's kind of has to do with their religious beliefs I guess\nAnd I wondered if ah I declined of course but\nA lot of it you think these things demonic Charles ...\nYeah [noise] [laughter] but you know yeah you're on the sounds so\nWell the thing is I don't I there are some of these some of this technology I feel that we need we need to hang on to\nTry to figure it out on that reverse engineer and all that I don't feel\nLike we need to have gone up and it got to go and destroy it or just because it sounds kind of religious\nI tend to think of it as sunlight irrational religious belief of but there are people at a very high levels in the in the military and other places that are tempted to believe that you know that this is the sort of stuff we should just destroy it rather than\nTry to figure it out and see if we can get some kind of good you\nAre and I believe that there ... there could be some kind of way to use it well or use it cautiously with with the whole create a can strengthen considerations\nUh but uh so I I don't know it's just uh but uh I was a little bit I don't know how far the reason why they asked me because I might have like ... more easily access some of these places\nWell that's that's an interesting take to be sure so Mac you're back with us\nSo I Am yep thanks charge\nSo tell us about the man eating tree of Madagascar\nWell believe it or not there are um the ... there's like a plant as opposed to those plants that eat flies and Venus flytrap but yes\nIt's actually a tree and there are reports that these things that you get too close some small animals all the way up to a you know while a children and so on but this thing will wrap you up and literally digest you\nThose things I'm always fascinated me I mean I Know they do they do they you know like they have like chemicals and grab you\nYeah mhm yeah and in a new just gets in in a ... that is very sticky again so you can't get away and they just kind of wrap your way up and down and you're gone\nGosh other regions of the country that are more talented than other regions or is it the same all over the place\nWow good question um it seems to be a you know kind of universally scattered all over the ... the globe certainly go stories you know a part of almost every culture sure I'm a ... that would actually be a good question other more ah that places aren't necessarily that are more haunted\nThan I Would sometimes think the east coast in that region would be more haunted I don't know but I think were Gettysburg is in in things like that the there just seems to be more strange haunting going on there\nIn the u._k. for a you know just talking about a very hot place maybe that's the most time to place in the world the\nPeople see more ... than any other place uh in Scotland there's lots of ghost stories lots of military ghost stories coming out of the you can cross fertilization has been there for so long these things built up you know but if it now that you asked the question if I could go out of a world that's the most time but I Would pick the u._k.\nNext up we go to Ernie truck driving in Washington first time caller Ernie thanks go ahead\nYeah died your age either and your gas uh I've got to UFO story that\nBack in Nineteen Seventy two it was August\nI remember I was taking pictures of the moon and I came around the corner and here I thought I saw the movie just off in my lab we laughed and realized the moon behind me and it was a UFO hanging over our house is harboring there\nAnd I pulled over I stopped I watched it for about Fifteen minutes I got out of the car forgot all about the camera in the back of the car that on the hood watch this thing it was about Seventy feet across perfect\nThere and then I heard in my hand something go we gotta go mhm and I said to myself something's gonna happen\nMhm and I said to myself something's gonna happen and I climbed back in the car and about that time get him down\nAnd started moving on always known than you\nAnd I could tell a walking in the sky because of the tree lined with the trees behind it was an okay you know I may I may have than I got up to a hundred and twenty and it pulled away from me like I was standing still wow well\nSee that's what's so amazing about these stories smack people or actually witnessing things ... years ago I went to a hundred and twenty miles an hour to try to catch this don't do that books but I mean something's happening right\nRight you know one person or told me I'm right after we came out with your clothes and a lot of time that\nThat I'm half the nine eleven uh the records from military pilots are UFOs went up in a dramatic way\nAnd not that you oppose had anything to do with nine eleven but the fact was was that they were just more of a military jets in the air around the clock back then to make sure it didn't happen again and therefore more military pilots out there\nMore UFOs scene but that just tells me that uh you know these things are there everyone always wants to think that you oppose hide from us but they're not they're around us all the time people see them all the\nTime they should do and military pilots are the best you know witnesses to these things\nWhat do you think these you know set of shutdown
