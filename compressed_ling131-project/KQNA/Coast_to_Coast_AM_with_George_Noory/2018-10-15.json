last Monday Night is on his website you can get to his website right now it coast to coast am\nAnd click on it and in the paper section on the right the top paper is the one we are discussing we are going to get really heavily into the chamber is on the inside of the pyramid\nAnd how they are located with my news formula that he has published in the paper more with by new right after this short break the coast to coast am [noise]\nHello there man man I Know and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry the jurors\nGo back great Cathy\nYou like that you like that very okay I\nAm today or I always love hearing is that all that you may have more do you play so great for me they gave the power\nAnd thank you Mary what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick\nAbout their armored collar just at the end of the first question is is credited with Jimmy ... the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics\nAnd then the second question is are higher graphics down go back recap in Egypt in that area of\nThe world the same are good things that are found in the pyramids of Mexico central and south of the matter\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff cliff inscriptions in Beckley ... is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking is are the Howard graphics that are written on the ... and Egypt going on a pair of ... the roar of and go back with the all the same\nIra Glass fix that are found on the pyramids and Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so they are there different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you you were saying that there are a hero lipic inscriptions\nIn Quebec he kept the in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry although I'm not an archaeologist don't have any fancy degrees after my name right but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at go back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H M the belt that looks very similar to the age blocks in ... who are are they related I don't know\nRight there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby\nOr they are they representing the zodiac ah that were in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that\nAre they the same I don't know but uh go back lead happy being that old\nCertainly is indicating that they were the first than it is the oldest is at the same language and then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she'd like to\nI call it the army's age and the bells when that looks like but did that he met ages repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to ... a ... and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there is a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nWomen know will do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me Mary it was right there but it just disappeared I mentioned it later on in the show thank you very\nNo problem thank for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call them on all of them but yeah let's let's go to this is going to\nGo to my dad in New York my ah Europe next\nYes good morning ... and nine and\nI guess the ... I like to know and he um had looked at any of that ... highly effective highly of any age and I\nAnd also I think that might be the one that deals with the is founding medical knowledge that they had that if if I'm correct on that particular widen\nTheir second pot now over there and\n... and ... and ... and ... had ten minutes I'm not the ... the African African American ballet who study the net net net too at\nA week the name of the language which came out of that and measuring that you know a\nPhrase healthier way say quit and whether he loved that people who call themselves a cabinet full and that in the kitchen you know before they\nThat Greek I came in and you can have a hippie Kennett colic cabinet where we got away from them but can they say\nAnd also um me what to call me in a way that we had well I think we got came up with and can mean what they define what the little if not\nWhat it is and the advocate in a market the dollar that I'm thinking that they call it a little odd that arrived ... ton will only saw\nOf fat if you follow them I'm not quite an outlet and all of the day I\nYou mad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that she goes to show you the the extent of knowledge here what's it called the audience or they don't play around\nCollege here what's it called the audience or they don't play around\nWith the first question um I I I Am and I have heard of the ... of money but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the pirates to attract actually in my book um because on the reverse of their egos ... there is an interesting calendar or that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this isn't it so that the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about a ... that's I think over sixty foot long uh it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm at this point pirates I Believe states to the middle kingdom and and to reach us back a most likely a probably to him all the time so um yeah there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nThe second part can Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a hundred and ... that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it the Egyptian language originally was a composite of two different cultures the water culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd the script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from ...\nA king scorpion and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh Mm probably from Bhutto\nAnd doors are sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably as opposed to any uh with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked a raft\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know with the hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south in that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adopting a ... a chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes that's true I think she mentioned it's getting so uh my uh we we think that stinks was making before uh before Crawford game I think it was we were I think it was the lioness and her name was ... and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or Joe\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or get tonight my new saved day his paper is right there click on his website the coast to coast am we're gonna discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\n\n\nWind up more button I get to log on to lose ... am dot com\nHuman in the um me\n\n\nThen they you know\nThe two men\nTalks loud ... three five five lines that I\nLearned for yourself ... all the original ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report I learned to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line ... lived for three five five when some of them are all the ... three and five five points out from [noise]\n\nBack to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess ... new shapes id\nMore talking about uh the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of it the great pyramid but his formula and his wife paper they published last week\nAn out to locate them and I want to say really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither for me or or buy new right there and this question just came here before we get to a a page out three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from uh\nOf the report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinate and that does coordinate point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinate to hand in heaven yes\nUm I haven't the right to propose\nIt's great to see this is this is when I really enjoy a about Dakota audience and and it's like you're so there is so much information out there\nBut there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid yeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the great pyramid\nHas revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the sonnet Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates a lot to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is having a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinate Thad Allen just discovered\nA fall right next to the ... of game you know which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have him on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd he is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with Shakespeare\nAnd his work now and greens work and the ... page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been in its freaked out as I was a witness saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it is absolutely incredible ... next month\nGo okay so now as the top half of the pyramid\nYes uh you said at the beginning of the show let's get to the page number three twenty eight everybody into the the ... report PDF\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we have been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a confident Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring the ah found is when you get some guns and brings door\nUh just before the the the floor off the off the off the canal drops probably if there is a depression\nAnd the way he is interpreted one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space that allowed that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know the courses that we've just been discussing\nThere is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty fix will quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth um and and then then let's go out and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and died this particular space not been a detected by ...\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this for a second in the\nUh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh it it going up words every body of one of those seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction that have a different sides of the different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as the show and going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just use this illustration is an old illustration um so that it that particular shafted not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of forty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that\nYou know I Am basic the establishing in the lower part of the care of it I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with a feeling in other words there is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space it designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNow do you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which uh did you find this cabinet ... new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw new detectors being place I'm at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confront them and there was confirmed as the scouting\nNow for the audience tell them what to move on detectors actually do where do they used for\nBy so these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so and cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them you on has created enemy on is\nA negative they charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a big heavier than electron but it can pass through solid matter if it's travels that the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote ex wait a pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed up and then you have a chance\nTo see his face a because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the pathway of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more of them will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the ... the chambers that you are proposing in the upper half of the [noise]\nThe chambers and that you are proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nHere it is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact tool and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big voice is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that that could be some some at the lower once maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nA let's say seven twenty fifth and sixth twenty fifth it's possible that if there is a a is if there's a space on the northern side on the northern half of the pyramid that it will get picked up by the scan\nUm it's also possible they put the active place in places that we don't know for example a you know the uh the chamber's above the king chamber\nYeah and we would never find out about that nobody gets to go up there\nWere the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM Jake you in a

chambers in the great pyramid more of your phone calls and more with my new when we come back after this short break that says coast to coast am [noise]\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bonded with one animal boxes Jim boom you just created nitric oxide miracle molecule your own body makes that fuels your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural nitric oxide super obese my human\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the most crucial um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a death another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves or into the things that are looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that they are here to our space is under this things\nAnd one of those faces specifically which is what Robert ... a a was studying uh years ago I'm a has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um that might be something in it that self interest\nYou know you did the seismic research there and both of you are looking to go back with another research expedition to hopefully drill right\nYeah yeah first of all what we are what we would like to do first as to map this again with a little bit more advanced a\nScience blogger fee and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know what you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven and ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and then Roberts ah you know did his studies up a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that his face is five meters deep so\nWe have a little bit of a deficit problem and then of course you know that's I have often marketing drilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was to shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so\nIt didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non invasive study and really find mapped the space\nAnd when we have a good idea where it is then with permission of course there were try a small pro or into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about and there's this since those rumors going around yea for quite a while it would just be great to finally a\nBed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of this\nGet a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and\nIf if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber\nOr the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly speaking\nOf the things that she just came in on Twitter this was from bald minutes ah on Twitter and I have heard that the stinks may have been a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think we think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes\nI don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie and that's there before and the head of the line as was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to gates\nI leave all doors open myself but this comes in from Lucy in winter\nAnd and and this is I'm just going to have to read this directly ads in Egypt in the images it seems like all of the pyramid to Mexico have an alien in space craft depicted somewhere any comments\n[noise] yeah I I Know I I remember reading this long time ago and I've found myself agreeing with that uh that's one way you could read it I you know I think that was Eric ... data can invite that originally the he's too she's talking about the ...\nYeah right the lid off to a ... right\nI have I have that's our topic is in my studio in the air\nAnd I have a reproduction of it hanging out in the wall by and I stopped and I look at that my new and I don't have any other way to look at that ... for the controls hand controls an oxygen mask slain coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI you know I don't have any problem with that I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is it in this day and age everything's on tables you just said it we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is in ... I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics off of a of the universe\nYou know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this but it you know there is one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nThen just like Robert Duvall proposed in cause big long is the one way you can explain some of these contacts is there may be a message that gets broadcasts across universe through you know through um ah through a quantum field\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid um I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it if\nBut we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nAnd let's go to the international line Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for a minute\nAbsolute owners regard as really critically a notion struck the when you talk to her structured space lose a look you're making ... couple of quick German some laundry\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect ... tremendous job dreams were big John ... is a farm in your own knowledge building ... structures\nAre who's to say I mean I mean put it to you know records people assume that the parents can be a periods are solid\nBut could you know maybe just you know you say is structured space to be a report on the rocks and everything you know arches inside because nobody's Hempel\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it to ...\nLead the conclusions that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and voids could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I've been I Need to have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is these on logistics base is basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scan from last year business show it but I think the theory is all that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm saying that could be theological and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know he reviewed the paper a but he still thinks it's possible that there were logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably space is up there\nAnd um I just want to ask you a quick uh cause the pyramid of cool pool it's it's as high spaces inside researchers in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know ... all we have his belt zone each chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but it's just something we need to talk about when we come back or gas Manu stateside eight minutes is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us\nMm\n\n\nI guess you know\n\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning here in Southern California Manu or the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to\nIt's going to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique welcome\nMonique how are you there\nOkay I didn't do that so let's go right in order to go to Mary in New Jersey Mary you're up next on coast\nAround town politic you and your calf\nI'm kind of something like four years older under and somebody the shiny and man standing there with the story from the garden of Eden\nAnd he just don't ... care blah building it and the native to number and they said how are you doing that he said I enjoy that I Am in that town now I think that a symbolic victory over the life\nCycle in the Bible and everybody ran into Egypt Abraham ran in there for the\n... man in the air Marion genesis man in there and um the Lyon county where I'm defeated the woman will crush the head of them could evil I\nFound like that it could that possibly be the original spot in the garden and he\nDid that is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that I'm Manu gardening beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David role so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a a a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think Timothy Mahoney if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um what they were in Egypt um I think uh there is\nFor specially Joseph I'm that's what David role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a a into them and in the pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears and does this archaeological evidence at well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new king dome and it's it's David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis I just came in on Twitter this is from Jane who and jade says I heard that surgeon tools were found in the ... pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a white woman Dixon\nUm and he uh end it snow in the British Museum a with a with a with a ground ball um but whether or not that was a ... and ... other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games up here on ms\nLet's go to bill up in Oregon bill you're up next on coast down to my new\nName on a new ... yeah this is the really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit if you just chambers or for construction in engineering could they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet\nOr could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those I'm the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill\nI'm ... I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate I I'm I'm looking for just ... I think because there is obviously I'm proposing up to ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's theological what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo inherently up all this uh the uh the ... was known for the center of the worship often nine major God this kind of like the pantheon of off the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be ...\nMentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be pirates both in their uh with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if we're if that were ever to be found a but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm withdrawing people will die think this it's still on the table that there may have been space is there that\nHelp the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible um and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next ... will give us some new information\nNow I have heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten the inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I Am not have any one of those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nYou would certainly help the tourism I mean ... let's ride which has dropped off I have heard you know you just got back from Egypt but I haven't heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because in years past it was crowded all the buttons were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the gays applied to today you can ... be the only person there\nYeah I ... I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that to me I I'm you know it was not\nThere were there were parts I think he's a plug toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are they are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about it\nIs it's a this is from Twitter from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] ah that's a good question it is a great question it's a great question um\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this was before before Nazi Germany um there there was of course German activity on the ... there was actually a great American German a collaboration on the gave up blood toll or George rising from Harvard and a\nAnd hair monument girl from a from the German a fun life thick\nAnd they were excavating them stop us think either but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties and then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted or end there was a big break\n'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comments because I don't know\nLet's go to a geo out east in the Bronx Joe you're on the Exxon goes\nHow ya doin' Jimmy I'm doing good Joe Santa Manu\n[laughter] I'm a new how are you going to take your good um yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid\nIs there any evidence that there were any any tunnels underground passage ways that would connect the great pyramid to other pyramid turned to vicinity and also can you tell me whether\nThere are any signs of blueprint that exist for either the great pyramid or any ... in that area\nA that's a fantastic question so [laughter]\nThat's right up my alley so the first question do I am I Would refer you to Andrew calling ... ... if you ask ...

I don't know you know what if when the when a antiquities goes and investigate those things that they don't publish the data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so you'll get as good as mine but I Am based on based on to the chamber under the left paw that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry all to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think that there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so we go to the back of the things in the south side by the tail\nAnd he looked down on the ground and he sees what he thinks is a piece of wood covered with dirt yeah so he he leads over grams would picks it up and into a piece of plywood\nAnd he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was the tunnel going straight down and as he was looking into the whole\nA guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was no scored it out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what I personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side\nOf the rear playing by the scale of the things and he saw himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about a ... I think that there is there's there are spaces under the things the main question is does it go anywhere it was just a blind pouch that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now he is\nHe is that is one of the craziest videos I've ever received on me and it ended his nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch the video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was gone and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes for these birds that were there\nAnd it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long been stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex\nThere wasn't supposed to be anything there then I Want to or denied that there were any tunnels there later went on his own expedition in film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again was supposed to exist but it does\nThere's also a potential pathway from the ... or from the uh the Cyrus shaft um you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there Phil\nBut I Know Robert was down there ... was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft of course he's your colleges are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... the I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the oath Irish half it's possible that the upper two layers are laid kingdom but the the lower level is much older we we don't we I don't think we know for sure\nAnd it may connect um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces\nUm but yeah it until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to invite the access is on the south side of the ... of conflict causeway\nUh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or ... three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you had the ... and water and the surrounding the base and that sort of the shape of the ... for a house\nI'm a and a and you know it had this offer goes inside and end up the four pillars around and it was fascinating um you know this ah this some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost to a hundred feet and the and the pillars that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the pizza plateau and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the right you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think they're the the the the myth dimension of the house of forest fires are on the inventories to it actually may be referring to\nTo that old style is Irish shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that or Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period tune belonging to\nA no official called um park cop or something like that can't remember the name but again that's just the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't a an older to him and then it was being intruded on\nYou know we don't think we know\nThe ... before we had to the break ... ... how much do you think is still love to be discovered ... applied to a there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah by well my my favorite place to look at it and and of course Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides the you know a besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things that could be in front of the things temple\nAnd then the other thing is we I predict inane mentors to our paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that it was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that will be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned is things on the other side is there are things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another things maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the gays applied to of course everything facing ... uh there there's a lot there had been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the gates a plateau there is an awful lot of that is being seen the uh the pyramid complex facing\nA west in northwest there's a lot there and uh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds\nBut there is a construction that is represented in the original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be export because they are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of is that why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with the huge trends and this oval ... Africa's placement\nUm but there's nothing nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I don't know what it's for a fact I don't know if this was a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fan potentially\nAnd who knows where we're going to be able to our north them\nWe'll be right back to the coast to coast am stay with us\n[noise] um [noise]\nNever missed a detail Lewis you get signed up for the ... ... email newsletter for free at

Manu I Want to thank you\nFor an amazing conversation tonight and and listening to an answering all of the questions from the coast listeners not only a via their phones but of course Twitter too as well an amazing amazing this is great yeah it's just it's such an important time\nFor research in what is going on I think that the great pyramid is finally starting to give up some of its mysteries so with that let's let's get right back to the phones so we've got one last segment here the school he says the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida\nA good morning a new day morning Jane\nGood morning Larry Ann how are you in the hurricane were you okay\nUh where I'm located in God made but I'm I'm located on the east coast\nYeah but I did it it it was a such a wide big storm that it it it

buy 'em according to rename as you might check that out they do it's very enlightening\nI Am the original capstone with court I'm very pyramid pyramid has granted and that which produces under pressure five electricity and you may know that's already I'm them they'd be done that\nWe don't know I've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course Edgar Casey\nEnergy they'll tell your occurrence or its current event in Iowa's rerouted around uh adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it to generate a electricity\nMalaria let me ask you a question instead of you asking my new a question are you reading pike unanswered gr absolutely and you see a you know in Christopher done and others have talked about uh the\nPyramid being a machine and possibly a generator of power and energy that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\nYou to join her to provide a labor free energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a cruise ship for done\nAs said to me last week while he talked about it for years of course I'm there wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he he looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases\nHe just fits all the observations into a model and that is ... you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call\nTo have them on board um you know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card let's go to Carol in Charleston D.C Terrell you're up next on coast\nWell hi Carol\nHello Carol well here quite or\nSeveral years ago or a national day twice found found artifacts and thought oh man found the Cleopatra him all I Know grounds to caring about you\nKnow I as far as I Do it I I I haven't looked into this and detailed as far as I Know but to them is not discover it but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published if possible\nA woman's your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology how do you go about\nGetting involved with one of the ...\nYeah that's a great question I so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt calls is this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course if a serious endeavor\nUh but you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know association affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the vacation you have to as a they have to review the application and they may say no and you don't have a recourse I'm also will have to
