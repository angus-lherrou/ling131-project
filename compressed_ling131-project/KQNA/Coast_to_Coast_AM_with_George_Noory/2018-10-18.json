taking my call 'em out or publicly think Allen he the one pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew\nThat the more effectively dies the lungs especially the taxpayer on her arm and hand crafted dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dad\nOkay I already knew the bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's one thing they don't want to mention and that is that the ... conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three\nSplit decision in the saddle case I'm pro life pro gun I'm as far as conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attacks because there's money going into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax\nThat don't do that real as a matter of fact the price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spent a lot in you know even as the conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security\nBut we can only cut those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money or that not only does it tax dollar on that hug and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian\nAnd Alan by the way I'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and\nI Hope I Am I here he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much but I don't listen and all of the reason it here's the deal OK almost ten percent of the total out of college debt and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of the window and get a credit card\nIdaho okay with that loans but let him get a credit card it will pay the tax dollar and it'll save the standing of college will drop like a rock and the allies not rich man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police\nLooking here if we can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but it looked like he can get bankruptcy repeatedly pre millions in bailout handouts\nAnd if all these rich banker need college is going to get the rates on student looking here that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use these are All right we got your point there Gordy Allen\nYou know I'd buy he said a lot there but I appreciate all his points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices back down to rational levels\nUh and you know it would it would really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWoman with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white could clean\nWell I Will say that if you had a minimum bankruptcy protections are not restored so that people can go to a judge\nAnd according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means if that does not happen\nThen we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a non partisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum a the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nAll and you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they are currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person\nA and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there was a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia\nUm so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise]\nUm but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other lender has to contend with [noise]\nAh that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFor some color mark in Provo, Utah Marco ahead\nWell George who said they can't or they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they've been paid for my books but the federal government makes you go to the student loan counseling\nAnd so I went and I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it oh boy I Would love to sue her\nThis did you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon ever pay it off I Will die\nHundred and three thousand dollars a gallon ever pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing where uh my payment is zero [noise] um I did a double major in a minor and some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack had she not at all that\n... exactly well what do you think Yellen these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that where you don't have to pay it back I mean the college and saw the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's it's just disgusting [laughter] you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on is probably the income based repayment for him\nSort of a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment\nBut what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority of people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital at a nonprofit getting loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show so that alone is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance\nThat mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program\nAnd actually get the loans forgiven\nOr and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income\nSo are you a twenty five years you\nGet a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can help it citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nThat was gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was bankers that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and uh many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they have no public a benefit the inspiration they jettison all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nEllen we're gonna come back and take final culture with you in just a moment to

now hurting or helping the economy\n[noise] [noise] well I I think it's clear that it\n[noise] well I I think it's clear that it's hurting the economy at this point\nUh you know interest alone on one point five trillion dollars is more than Ninety billion dollars a year or so that's money that gets taken away from home purchases or you know business formation\nThe auto ... you know other ... big ticket items that improve the economy [noise]\nAh so certainly is hurting in that respect a and you know it's it's also running in a number of ways are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people\nA straddle there's you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels typically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um this really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy\nA and certainly those people pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nPaul Fresno, California to get things started here west of the Rockies ball go ahead sir\nHey I'm very grateful you think Michael thank you very much Georgia now them I'm graduated from college two thousand Fifteen just before it closed down [noise]\nI'm I'm One of those fortunate who are that long going through the Allen with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I uh got thirty four thousand thirty seven dealt with that I got you know that I owed forgiven\nWow how'd you do that and\nGraduations I appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of an hour away um there is something called\nA binding and what that is is that like a lifting of\nPretty much like a course of your book or trade the trader Joes yeah and what it is is a bit of course who are the reason they're in the situation because they both by job place so if you are from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm\nPretty much that's when they committed a that broad so it actually took me from\nI Would have to say December to ... to around August of two thousand uh fixing to get it all given\nWhat I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris email um she surprisingly bonded um but the the avenue that I went to go after David how to write a cover letter hum I submitted a pretty much a with a cover letter I had to put a plenty on it then I had to pretty much\nUh put it all out there what I'd gone through no not the transcript to a a cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually I have to prove that I went to college\nIt was the fraud that they've done it reduced I guess right\nA yes or that one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the ... one thing they promises lifelong job placement assistance [noise] so what how I false advertising\nYou have to exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your ball in the job place there goes your your life like long drop like but if\nYou got that right the interesting Alan isn't it\nYeah that you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up by some other point and show there are some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like the just like Paul mentions\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degree is this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where\nIf your school ... you then at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you at least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I I think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise]\nAh but I Will say that even just yesterday and um [noise] one of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of do a lay and slow walk this this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by particularly a for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for records you know\nWell you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the note and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and not similarly for student loans we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned the note and they have no business collecting on that loan um\nA now there are other there are some avenues that the lenders can go to they can say that the new was lost and they have other avenues to prove that is a valid no but that's certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to you Twenty years hands and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that alone is not\nLittle suspect little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where he took up alone\nDuring a pat and Minneapolis east of the Rockies high tech go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at least one of the agenda as\nIf the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with color than earth grandparents parents still one of them are ever going to get any security

student loans and what is even more disturbing icy legislation out there right now it has been passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age ah so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to\nTake away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers interesting\nIs that what did you have one other thing\nI'm a student loan borrowers interesting is that what did you have one other thing did you want to say\nFamily has already where we don't take generations the grandparents the parents and the kids are never going to get any thoughts scary\nBut it just you know that if you have if you want to help the students and tear up the ... you write a check to the school or a money order or other travelers jak or whatever and they can bring as he says\nWell here's my transcript for the last

for being such a great student and such a hard worker\nWell that's part of being a good parent that you got to do that with a child\nYou know I might also comment on the the the question about coast signing\nOff I urge all parents to never ever go sign on a student loan for his ... that's just the worst thing you can do I have seen families just ripped apart by these loans and indeed the lenders

I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not that's not entirely correct and I don't want to do these surveys head he'd be it for the tip contract quite quite openly in legitimately and through the the standard contractual\nProcedure and he'd go on a large chunk of that I tip black but of course justice the the government requires that people sign their the secrecy oh it's so Robert Bigelow and and um he's organization had\nEveryone on the norm disclosure agreements so actually the people involved in this work what kind of um strong twice so to speak they had they had to have government security parents said but also the commercial nondisclosure agreements\nOr the commercial nondisclosure agreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other thing in in aliens at the end again I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um you reports of this you go onto the bulk some forms you see a lot of speculation\nI was always taught at the ministry of defense you know when I was doing analyst where for example and briefing you must always differentiate between ... you know and what you're saying\nAnd that looks a skill that everyone practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be with us on accident\nAnd we don't even speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so hopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... where we don't know that these things\nWell absolutely what's the bottom line with what you're going to tell you is really going on what's happening\nWell [noise] I don't want to I I don't want to get too far into spoiler parents like but I think I think one one thing that I can say which I think it's a pretty good summary off\nOff when I think has gone down [noise]\nIs that I Would say they're all this I mean you thought would deliberately I Believe a faction if I can call it died within the U.S government and some of those people were put him in a employees and some were can try and ... and this\nBelieve a fraction of the phenomenon was absolutely rail and and they were correct and that of course didn't entirely know what to think of at the\nRule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal and actually then I Believe a faction became or or certainly interacted with overlapped with with a tab [noise]\nAnd they effectively I I guess you got the chance to put those those beliefs and those hypotheses\nWithin the government we've taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about the X because and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now it's going to talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of that but\nBut the bottom line to answer your question is is that I think there was a believer faction they made them move they came up against some roadblocks couple of different road blocks one Rose Bowl was they simply going to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigated but because they didn't get a definitive on to the feeling was that they taking it as far as as they couldn't wells can you do the other sort of road blocks but they have and this is very controversial is a hater\nI I'll call it a religious road dog from some senior people in the Pentagon who find play for the ... you I thought it was from the paranormal with him on it and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with that\nWell what do we do\nDo we want anything to do is oh well I mean um it it would start to eat whatever the laws but I I as I say that there were people in the Pentagon ... who who's\nDeeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic\nPhenomenon here might come on come up again and that is a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense to in fact one of one of my bosses was I'm a you know pretty extreme with the S.\nAnd indeed the the individual who wrote that the classified\nIntelligence assessment on on UFOs in the ministry of defense carried named ... ... he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some slight he owed beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book of Asians I think it is where it refers to cite as being the principal power of the ... and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea of UFOs might beat demonic\nAnd there were a lot of ... I Believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it it it's frustrating\nIn San ... and it's almost\nCall me play ironic in another way that that you know you have a bunch of people in the Rio de da da ... and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it ... scientific manner and we come up against skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\n'em that kept them isn't for the soul to the whole uh intellectual\nA human nature skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it it's a deep probably trying to believe ... skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the pen picking\n'em I say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's paying one arguably fringe belief for another two front wheel that these ... these people and skeptics are told they will believe those but they would you\nBelieve us in some some great Warren happen with\nAngels and demons Nick we're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on schools to you know you can just show up to each other coups tunes would you do in the ... the um the the ... to respond to accomplish glued to the human like [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nWe'll come back to the cultural back with Nicole nifty using an old at the alien\nPresidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is a problem we grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and and you find the um law to oils in in the waltz Naomi and a ten year program to declassify and release them\nHeavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFractious um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the left has made quite amusing reading\nAs as the intelligence\nPeople telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and and you know you that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy um they said I'm a and if you don't mind I've actually gone to document in front of\nMe please give us some quotes from\nYeah this is this actually haven't officially been released yet I'm Will be tonight it\nWill be nice um [noise] the second in critical question is do you a pay rent present a possible threat to the defense of the well we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument that something exist\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however Russian act coughed attempting to penetrate the u._k. defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represented a threat not the only logical conclusion\nThat we can come to is that we do not know if you ate pays represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so they scan it's quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public knows there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if there are any different interests but no no no threat\nAnd yet in one of the time to fight documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nWe simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be proof of some kind of threat\nWell it it would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's basically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like about ... Jacobs\nWhere we're always saying you know the whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual\nView of this talk about healing and things like that I think goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean it sounds\nBizarre but in millet treat them there is actually in a way Asian for him would hang out with all of a threat to our knowledge or rather the the the ... of them we don't know the value is\nBut in intelligent some military sickles\nWe say that threat is defined as being a constructive capability plus intend\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then he would count whether there's a threat and if there is ... ... ... what kind of a threat\nIt is well we have some idea about the capability of you a pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files state quite clearly you know pizza maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything though when we've gone so the capability we we know has a high value what we don't have any idea about the intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once\nWe it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal\nTo march in Greece\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to apply to try and figure this out he said it might be the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics and when you find the\nWell we don't know what it is we don't know what they want what can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I don't know that well I mean this is the nation's attention well\nWhat I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you a pay our rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defined region I'm In the u._k.\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U.
