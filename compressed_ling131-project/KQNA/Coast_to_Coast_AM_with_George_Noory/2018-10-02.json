with me computer I used to take me I'm George hours when I'm doing now in in minutes or in a union and you'd\nBetter be minutes on this show right could you imagine taking hours\nOkay uh you have a it's interesting just like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through their kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but you our son sign Aquarius aquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of thing\nWhere you're you you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and what's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also it's like equality\nInterestingly you like the previous caller had an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn you have one two three five ... record more than even what you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth pattern is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George was something really for two to good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own ... as well here's somebody Donna you're born with ... so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn\nSo do something in the world or something you know we're making 'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or a neighborhood where you are states you know to do something that you feel a significant an end worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm doing if you just\nIf you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctors thing whatever it is nice right then you'd say okay ah looked serious enough that you know going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit for how long you know and then come back to me it\nCould be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know\nHave have you do something you know the what happened so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is in some magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and they they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there was the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces and there's some Capricorn but it would be like gobbledygook\nBut ... but when you have done it for forty six years you know is there like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less less than a dollar or a month or less than ten dollars it's it's kind of part of the new great fare\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to charge themselves right into the the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of my Pisces what I Am when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say this I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts of compatibility with a loved one or a parent and a child\nBut my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and murdered the study and I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible it well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage charting really yeah it'll be but the thing is it's and it's very fine tuned I'm there we have we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something call ...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they can put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get background information both people but basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time\nAnd it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for pilots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nOr are you like a human too real card\nWell I've created to to row decks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did inner child cards which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of promotion of that and then I did baseball ... and I just ran into the gal ourselves\nThe other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of we're doing calendars but they had never done a trope projects I've done to row longer than I've done a strategy\nGoing to give you our next so special callers birth said first of all November ...\nSpecial color his birth date first of all November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Radley do you know where you were born\nThough Illinois Mandela\n... well ... ... by the time many idea\nI'm I'm not sure the exact time\nOkay do you have a question from mark who just want him to get going here\nUm I like the whole aspect to you know like you know require nature also another thing like that but I Wonder you know make a difference you know are you are and things like well\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make you know I I'm aware of the five different elements and those kind of things and the you know the ... the birthdays are kind of but um what I Need to know was was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one second okay while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on by the way we're going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nOkay who November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in\nLike close to sunrise this person is a sense on Scorpio but you're not going to believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another moon an area that that is really talked about that so unusual so yeah I mean the whole time three callers all with an areas man that's my that's my audience\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know if it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor um sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon and areas conducting Mars and he's the son find Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled that water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of indoor of energy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently in Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on\nThis individual is mercury so he the fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people who have his certified Scorpio need to really get into the things I'm sort of in a hot and heavy weight and stay with it\nYou pick lottery numbers mark\nI'm I I often enter you know the different lotteries Powerball so on a five years ago I had four out of the five numbers horrible didn't show up wow closest I've come that would've been a almost two million dollars minus whatever the feds would it take it but it didn't happen\nThere were those mark we're going to come back in

back into my body taken a while but you know artists bag over there and I I Can't say I don't know\nThis is Richard astro all of a carnival or research international call one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five or visit carnival ride dot com C. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com call now\n[noise] [noise]\nWe are back with Mark Warner our final segment his website great to bear enterprises dot com park there was a a media writes shooting star affect anybody's astrological chart\nUm I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy yeah Wisconsin I don't know if you get it beautiful credible gotten it for a long time and they just had a previous issue with there's a a ...\nUm and they just had and the previous issue with there was a free program I I don't remember exactly where it is I have in order to get\nWhich I think is really unique where the the people can see\n'em they can plot like around America around the world when the moon would a called a planet or star and even an asteroid so it's sort of comes close to where you're asking about and that's actually a software programs so\nIn the software world these are amazing things but media you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one in August you know the Perseids and different ones um there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic lead the people who are prone to\nYou know respond to earth changes you know some people tune into earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible that it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nTime let's go back to the final cultures they line up for you or your ... birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona Tucson how are you Albert hey\nGood evening George good evening market\nIn the upcoming birthday to you my friend\nOh well thank you hey another year oh there you know\nThey keep clicking by do you have a question for mark or just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question would have been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money laundering money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay uh by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that that's where we get algebra and there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and so on one of the something called the part a fortune\nAnd throughout the entire of segment there the part of fortune\nFor Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon\nAnd the moon was also it depends on the side of cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which is kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened will this fellow now has a Pisces ... and ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who've Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and paths okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into it can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way by\nThe sun side of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nI'm Dan Roger talked about lever as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of a lie on the head of a it'll be a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summer time is of cancer Leo Virgo and lever and so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of more about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiated you know two thousand years ago during those last years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a glass and very and in England I mean these are kind of more but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nOr anything else they're Albert ah no\nJust uh how is the my upcoming year looking well Jupiter you have for planets ... inside the terrorists are Jupiter is kind of tick off what are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems\nTo get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called tire on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but that that there are gifts from the heavens so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really trying to give you some gifts here so hopefully you can use them\nAnd that's not going to the Rockies no member twenty in Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born to forty in the morning or mark\nBoy you're going fast November twentieth Nineteen\nFifty five what time to forty in the morning ... am to forty a yeah let's go to Jean in Florida she was on her mind tied Jane\n... all the how's everything oh I'm going okay hey any questions for mark or just reading um I was just in general and meeting All right\nMark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty eight\nNow okay well uh kept her mom away [laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius um where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of Aquarius and\nThis woman who is called a has the moon with higher on which was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven entire on is kind of a shame and the mentors so this brings up the idea\nOf getting involved with the group or some kind of group process would be really good for muscles spiritual standpoint we're kind of building rainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other caller you you're going to get the fortunate ah Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called you know the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship\nOr creative artistry and when it's cold than north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit there on such a terrier so Jupiter is going to help you with\nAll the said you're carrying energy that the the big issue probably in your life of being a sun science Scorpio and you have a son close to the Saturn is either um you need to be the warrior the turkey no for the scorpions warrior I Am from the battle I emerged triumphant in every son signed Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next uh you know next year next Thirteen months it starts to November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall and into the new year so there are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane [laughter] um how about um your cleaning cannot ... how um yeah I see that yeah oh is that going to get any thinking well if\nOh is that going to get any thinking well if you don't okay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle to where the moon is and it's all so you're at an age where you're honest as making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid his nervousness and anxiety cars in medical astrology or on that planet Iran has a lot to do with the nervous system\nAnd so when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects\nThat new using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing than good things are happening but if you sort of are not on a clear path of what you're doing then if you develop a lot of anxiety and worry and stress you know you're you're going in the wrong direction you got to get back on track\nStress really does screw people more oh I mean\nAnd here's the thing what people don't realize you know and I'm not going to say anything against eastern astrology but you know a lot of people as you may know they'll say oh you know I'm I'm doing invaded or Indian Astrology which is a different system you know over in India and it's ... it's ... it's basically the same pilots on my own and so on\nThis has been brought to you by preppy

will be I'm I'm In touch with her so cool I think I Will\nDo you think the media today is different from the media back in the sixties because it's my feeling Gordon that the media in the sixties really seemed to be interested in us all cases\nReally seemed to be interested in us all cases in something huh you took it seriously I mean Mike Wallace when he was on ABC in Nineteen sixty eight he was interested he interviewed key but they're all they're always seem to be censorship going on there but\nI Know well I I can tell you back and uh and the sixty seven are doing the flash sixty six

why you're talking about McDonnell now right\nWe were you were you interested in UFOs and things like that then\nOf course yeah as a matter of fact a a Jim McDonnell was out of her home it tastes them of course you know move out there James they McDonnell was the number one advocate matter of fact he tried so hard to get time to change his mind\nThat he had just slammed his fist down on on next

Twenty one in Detroit ... as a radio reporter my first interview was would stance and Friedman\nIs in he's still he's still going strong you slowed down a little bit but you said that\nHe told me

you ... you know\nWe we need you to keep this message out there what is your gut tell you about you will lose and whether this plan is to be visited or not\nMy gut tells me after doing all the research writing this book reading mysteries of the skies measures of the guys was the first book ever written in Nineteen sixty eight that went back um the I I went back before that cannot Arnold case ha ha\nAnd matter of fact I went into the national archives in Washington DC\nAnd town a ships are wailing shipped captains log\nThat actually described in his own handwriting or death came out of this guy went down into the water came back up again and then circled the ship and then set off at a tremendous to it\nAnd and this was like in Eighteen forty eight or something like that at all and there was another case that I found also in the national archives\nIn the seventeenth century where\nI'm at a sub men were rafting a a a poet or trying to paddle a raft down the muddy river\nAh in in Massachusetts when they saw this huge addicts desk that came out of the sky\nI started drawing the raft up river against it and then it it left it up out of the air for a little bit plopped it back down into the water and took off disappear you know ... it had all of a lot of those things\nAnd and a lot of that was um in my book masters of the skies UFOs in perspective\nYou know people like John Mack and um\nBut no I didn't know John Mack and all that if I say I guess about Nineteen eighty to ah\nTo when I started this book are working on this book about two years ago so I was sort of out of a new one on the other things other careers as a writer and director and I wasn't much\nUntil they are really a constant day by day investigation do this now now France has her age at his I'm at the ... what you might be familiar with has done a remarkable job job along with Barry grain wood and Jana Aldrich and re power and others\nAnd keeping 'em all of these reports and and right now they have a series of reports from the Nineteen fifties\nClassics that I Know they're just classics that really are would you believe were being visited\nAbsolutely I have no question about it I I really believe that then after a writing my book particularly and uh uh uh\nUh we're close with a ... a you know we've been I bid on each and aliens on the History Channel in ... these incredible stories

took her three years and I've been a lot I've been wanting for at least the last ten years to do this book and finally\nGot around to it and hopefully it's my um it may be my swan song but I think I get a movie about this subject and why\nDo you think the government really has not disclosed what's going on why don't they tell us\nWhy I think they're becoming close with this latest program out with the Pentagon I think it's the closest I've ever come\nBut um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of a ... but uh I think that we have known all along where these uh uh saucers that come from and we've been\nActually exchanging perhaps technologies with a major\nHit it it sounded like a far out thing is that something kill would approve of it as hey day\nA matter of fact Campbell was reluctant to put out any of the Occupy her porch until I wrote the boat strange effect from UFOs\nIn Nineteen sixty nine which was really a night cap publication\nBut for the first time we got into the the occupation cases and uh and and and things like that but of course it was a main focus was to get to ... herrings he managed to do it twice and thick Nineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd he has the great hopes for the University of Colorado a UFO project\nBut I think I called my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado UFO prod project because we are just symptom of disarray members of our ah out of some of our our best cases\nAnd I'm In the long run they just\nAlmost completely ignored them\nI remember when the Condon Report came out and kind of pooh poohed UFOs\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine yeah wreck from that time on all the funding for an eye cap went out and then a a a there was a knockout staff member was also at the CIA connection than\nI think to say I had been trying to take it for a for some time of course Roscoe Helen ... who is the first chairman of the night cab board after ... took over a was the first director of the CIA\nSoul food you're right yeah yeah what do you think that she wanted to do is I Can't just go watch it\n[noise] well I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call of didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that\nThere was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon who had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA planned and put the date for some reason didn't want to believe it\nUm which which struck me kind of I'm off balance because ah actually that was the one that before I ever came on board I think it was on sixty four maybe sixty create or\nTo CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of early over a period of several hours and\nUm\nSo I think they knew all along that uh you know that they have a certain amount of control or but uh and and kill\nAnd uh\nI don't know I I just don't know how much K O really new I really believe that it was the a ... I think he believed the CIA was\nWilling to let my cab continue um\nAs long as they can monitor\nAs long as they could monitor or right and I I think he was\nAs long as they could monitor or right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine\nWho fired you all days\nBut um I think it was a joke of Brian he was gonna say CIA contact the did you like El Nino eight seed CIA member and the ... and and uh and and Colonel Brian um\nAnd also do ... and uh and it was hard ... see a connection story next them it was the the the plant and the office had CIA connections\nAnd uh I think they were just trying to see how they could actually take it over and not make it look like it was a CIA takeover\nHuh I mean was it like the independent private organization\nIt was supposed to be yeah exactly\nWho who who had the authority to let you going to you too you said that's correct he loses under\nThe I Know but but the thing is that see we had a board of governors\nAnd um and early sixty nine they appointed a key how the president now he was the director first they opponent and the president and they appointed me the vice president because they call that time had left and taken a more lucrative er physician\nAnd uh I'm about to end by the end of last year it took less than a year for them to a closed down me or organization but I think they had been a a a\nA really monitoring us all along matter we when we even got the air force and one or the kill an hour on the phone and I can't live with the hundred miles south of Washington DC he wasn't on the office on off without often maybe once every two months or so [noise]\nUh and we were talking about a UFO case and all of a sudden we got to click on the phone and we heard a voice that said well major what Noah this is Don ... affect the course accurate quite know it was the air force spokesman at the time\nAnd then we had another cat a situation where keel wanted a to ask me if I were joined with him and creating got totally false case and then happened to be a ... and so we created a case where UFO had landed\nBut there were occupancy and there were special effects the Reagan electro magnetic uh affects aliens walking around and they actually showed up at a and one of the project Blue Book reports\nAnd of course back in sixty eight sixty nine I think it was we publish the a project grudge and Blue Book before so it was the first time we were able to get those reports shaken loose from ah the air force of through the freedom of Information Act\n... did you ever know ... in the late Apollo fourteen astronaut gr Michel\n... no I didn't know I'm a ...
