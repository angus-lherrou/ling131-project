be Christian what was to be Muslim what it wants to be Buddhist all of that will be left on this side of the door\nAnd what's on the other side is completely different that's all I can hinted right now I\nI Can't let go by without asking you about the middle east will start taking phone calls and winding up here for you what's your take cynically on what's going to happen in the middle east with Syria in Iran in this whole situation\n[noise] well it's unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we are now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it follows a prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made in ten predictions for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happened [noise]\nUm Syria is an ally of Iran and is always long story short the\nThe announcer Thomas prophecies that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this is a Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies their vows holes\nWhich are described in an anagram as Arab vessels by by a dye or OB in in French or that that kind of or oh rebel against their their their masters and drag Russian America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours of the weavers into a peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five [noise] of course it was worth their dictator the shot after we overthrew their government two years earlier that was democratically elected\nThat doesn't get told you in the u._s. press\nBy most of the decorating most of their yeah see I took him down to help the British Petroleum veteran retain a Iranian oil [noise]\nAnd then they helped train the survivor which is as worse as bad as the gift shop in Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic that's why the nature of the shah ... yes and so so this bad karma here and we're basically blindsided to our side\nUh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comic ally now so so\nWe have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's the last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\nThe city in Syria four\nIn Syria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force\nAnd the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started\nIs um arid organ of or ... the president of turkey and the ladder and food and got together and made a pact\nTo not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area so herbal what what's good about that is it's it's an attempt to not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the ... film the White Helmets in through our basically al ... is a A R [noise]\nUh had already taken children and use them and some gas attack that says story I'm trying to track down\nAnd it was going to be broadcast is still ... started as a once again another false flag that Syrian regime had chemically weaponized them and that would have caused ah [noise] you know we have thirty Russian warships says this time around\nAnd a mere equal number of American ships crowding the eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious\nAnd and so and then one thing can lead to another into a nuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of\nMissiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm their strategy kind of planes too and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in a short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War\nWhen the Russians announce they achieved a parity in March first this year they delayed they're putting their latest address to the nation Russia and any so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been and an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves a very very destabilizing move a Harley reported\nSo the Russians declared in March first is pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something it's past seven hundred billion\nThat's another thirty seven billion or something it's asked a hundred billion if you add the other side to it were really steady one point one trillion dollars\nOn defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetarily GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed\nIt was paying half of its money into his big military and they collapsed were doing the same thing so\nUh it's it reminds me of prophecies of ... spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and who was considered the Swedish Edgar Casey in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and traps\nAnd he he would say things like ah you'll see the one side of the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America will become more like the Soviet Union and police in this economic sense\nThat's true ah with more censorship that's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also I Would say from my own experience with journalism and we're definitely looking more and more like Soviet Union I grew up with that in the country I grew up with\nNo that's not true in in ... in the last minutes we before the break them will take final calls next half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide ... this this intrigues me why are you doing this\n[noise] well I've been watching it on the board game since two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique rebellious but brilliant unorthodox way of\nKind of dragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate in my travels ... it's kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach\nTo really meet with people when people break break bread they they they it it's a connection that's all it's all I was saying earlier in the show how\nWe can we need to talk to each other rather than polarized will\nHave a big bank would have all the red Republicans and Democrats break bread together like Anthony would do so anyway I watched the show I also saw the brilliant man his doing what a lot of potentially brilliant people and he's also seeker\nA spiritual speaker in a true sense because he wasn't buying into easy a rationale believe he was really questioning things on course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well\nAnd it wasn't a surprise to me that he committed suicide because I feel as much as I Love him I also had a similar things issues in my own I'm\nReally let's talk about that John when we come back in a moment we'll take your calls have you on hold just hang right there\nNever missed a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the coach soon email newsletter nobody little for free it goes to the um dot com [noise]\nTV grown past us ... dot com and download ... absolutely and I do go to you as a lead on common sense right now that's us all the all access not ... it's just a hoax\nI don't know what I'm saying like turning Kandahar into step I stayed back friday but the foreign aid thinks I gotta get ready to be tickled pink because your age because you're saving kind of anti cancer\nAnd Saturday I Wonder if that's what I think I hear you can give me ten states\nLittle things everything stage ... by the star for the house\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back coast to coast George story with you John ... with us we'll get to your calls in just a second I just have one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about the lead celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a tale of two suicide a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am\nAnd both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because\nMy experience with suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide and most people encounter\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with their pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane legal to do\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of a whole other dimensions of my life\nFrom all these years I've never known this\nWay I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time\nAnd when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day and so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park because I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and as I was walking it just dawned on me as as I could just keep walking a beyond these cliffs and climate down three hundred feet into the rocks\nAnd I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of\nLife and death suddenly being very tangible unclear I got to see how they were really won there really\nThere are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond where it's really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences over taking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge [noise]\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it and it's some point I felt this electrical energy just rise up I'll aground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass\nWhere I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly all of that thank God all of that [laughter] you know solve that otherwise I wouldn't be killing ... no not at all [laughter]\nAnd uh and and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turn and there was a little eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeves and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where I realized the sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in even at that moment of life meeting death insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's sort of the story is really an ... it's it's a jump from what I usually right about what's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books and they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people are shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line\nAnd there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's a people magazine a van seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on the picture in the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized yeah I Love him just as much and I think\nI think I understand what he was going through\nHe was not a man to all believe\nIn uh in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his ends and all that it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die at that I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakened one\nAnd I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much I'm\nA mixed and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ... point this\nCenter of silence and peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that is what I can share with all of you to meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with and evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nYou know six ... culture in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Home Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while it's hard to follow your sharing your experience on that but my question John yes\nFor a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered less so to speak such that they are on a point dead on effect dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology well\nI can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest is my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise] and uh so my answer to that is\nIf any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying [noise]\nEspecially with the shoe suicide in life meeting death [noise]\nUm I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed jury you can be a Buddha and the market place but not of the marketplace of the world and that was\nNot of the marketplace of the world [noise]\nAnd that was what my teacher talk show and that is more live lives since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time and so with that said if

again usually want to do I need to stay safe secure\nI think in my career as a special ed teacher\nOr ice that work with kids who didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristics that normal people have this one I began to feel like I was blessed George ... or you had to work with these kids to appreciate that that is when I started trying to pay back\nBut just being normal size started by prayer life I always had a prayer life but I saw it apparently this is a prerequisite for white had this operation\nI mean it's for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes\nHad these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so that would give them coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are ... that the ... and the lines\nAre with the numbers more but some of them has it's terrible it's your campus say they would rule while Louis arch coloring they withdrew their mouth ... was in school you were at\nWell I was a ... yeah I'm In a special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was yeah children like that okay we wait cleaned it up for them it was nothing to rule because they said that all day long so that they didn't mean anything to them\nEr and er so anti but you know where they were learning a skill that they were never going to use the you know there was no really cure for them back to and even today just really no you're\nSo at a special I teach I had a lot of time in my hand and the kids need to two hours to belong to the teacher said with help feed them or there's no papers to correct\nThe bigger kids that had in the ... in the room you used to move\nBack as long as I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was a sign roles and he put the boxes on them and they shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this gives me this school supply I enrolled us in my class sideline up the kids\nI think until it can get it box but it on the island world he would slide it down to the next get they get they would open it up decided down to the next day they were put some men inside down to the next kid tape and you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time so George I know how to park and so I had bought tend to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to this house\nWe doing two jobs John\nI mean that being a special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this so\nSo um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night out there looking for fun now a lot of 'em real stand up people but there was a certain percentage of people who doubt no doubt talk sided thing to these people are like little wicked\nHave looking for a cause ... alcohol and drugs to commit adultery anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists they went to the call us a little bit me George I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior didn't even bother me back there but to us over the years I noticed that\nThis type of behavior the enemy Bobby ... over the years I noticed that a lot of these people died from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers and [noise] and I thought what these people in the ...\nAnd I knew them you know up and I felt that these people like ships in the night without a rather anyway that I Would take him to a ... or the winner was blown that was fine with them and they died this state that I thought nobody should\nDie then we're the only that's running unusually high\nYeah unbelievable\nAnd so um you know I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing is focused on the teacher has its ... year the nose I self you know that means that I'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means do you the truth about you\nYou are what they do look at what you'd do analyze what you do then analyze what you believe about yourself you might find it completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I Try to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into his name is Chris he was a bartender he worked right alongside and he was an atheist than there used to make fun of God used to make I mean he just needs to make fun of the Virgin Mary I smoke and drank every night seven nights a week\nI didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states can't oh she's\nSo he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know gone from school my school job in my night job or how we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know where you're not going to\nI Know it had this for about forty years and in a few months and he died within a few months\nBut I Would go visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but now he wasn't interested at all he was even more bitten out George because of the diagnosis he had died he died in such a terrible state he died in a state no one should die and\nUh I I felt like help us form now in my religion joined told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially if no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and I felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to hell that don't let you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left an hourglass that's what I was going to do and I believe that it was the prerequisite of why this human creature was compelled to assess my house and out build that mosaic FOIA piece by piece right down to every single detail\nNo object you can't really little we'll let me ask you this little ... this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not absolutely not I've never had like a I've never you know I never had ... invited\nTo speak to here I never had to say on I never use a week he bought more I never use tear card I mean I I Believe that opens the door for a creature like this to come in and I don't think anybody does that because\nI now I think if you allow the street to come in and he'll do harm I think if I met him it was worse when you're the only other time you had\nNo there's no doubt if you if you invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you do is\nAbsolutely not I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology able to discuss that too but the other really other time in a while you know I thought that I worked in Michael that's why I wrote that book anyhow that's the best selling book that you know if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about a rapid Chris Brown\nThat's such a topic we don't we don't what which we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] so anyway people\nIn Raleigh why into was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah okay so the only other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul he we had this a rare a if a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it killed him very early in the sixties had a heart attack and died I think that\nThere was an unfortunate for you to get it are you OK get ... excuse me are you are right [noise] yeah what was the ... disease\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah a doctor who well let me tell you what happened to pull you and I'll tell you\nFelt Pauli wakes up and they had the same symptoms my dad had chess than say dolls nine one one they can they come and they take 'em to the hospital\nAnd at the hospital he dies on a hospital bed and when I went to visit them later on he said to me John ... you know and I heard that he died on a hospital bed that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I died on a hospital bed I left my body\nI left my body and I watched that doctors\nFrantically ... fine to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not uncommon eagles\nAnd yeah and the alarms going off and had like when I talk about that fifth fifth dimension that spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still thought he still thought he was in the hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body\nIn the hospital he said to me it and it and then there was a dark side of that room he said and dangerous came from a small team is not like big ones like three foot four foot toys I came to me\nAnd it was grabbed me and was shot in the only answer that dark area of the room which I which I say is the cause they they overlap sometimes and I believe that's where we overlap for him at fifth dimension and ah they were dragging him into that talk side of the romance I finally got back to life he was able to get back into his body\nAnd he had to make daddy why didn't demons coming out I'm not really that said if a person he said you know I don't understand ...\nWhy would ... me and I was like boy I really don't know uh I don't know if anybody would no I Know that you know all of us are raised the same way like I said you know I've got a religion confirmed and our religion\nHe was too but he dropped out and okay I have to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really married to live with it OK yeah again I tell them you know you got kids that you never gave them a religion can anyone you can't even ... one one prayer maybe it's probably not\nWell I well I don't know maybe you get a kick and yet but sometimes when you when you pass into that fifth dimension you know that that we were at overlap somehow\nOn John we're at a break come back and talk more\nWith so I didn't know streamlined ... reduce if you're ... if we want to enjoy or when you go to Lucy I'm dot com on your iPhone or Android grocery\nAdvisors total solution to any type of war she would ever want to do around\nYour house and that's just completely free so to buy their dot com or download for free and [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd we'll come back to coast to coast George George with you is the devil has approached you were going to take calls next dollar withdrawn you can join let's pick up the story about your brother your brother is a time what happened [noise]\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh I mean this is probably the only other time I've ever had an encounter with a devil that I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it\nAnd he wasn't really a bad person I mean okay left his religion like we talked and then he he lived through the woman he didn't get married to an end to raise his case they didn't have a religion so\nUh you know I felt that made me but he said you know to me ... you know when I died on that hospitals that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically trying to\nGet me back to life again with the latest and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and they could hear the alarms going off ... but he was in that like that they mentioned that overlapping dimension I guess\nAnd he said there was like a dark part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping to mention there he even came for him and he asks me well why didn't demons ... man I was like for [laughter] I really don't know why\nWhy you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had this problem I had a problem like just before I before I had this adverse and in my house\nBut um I Wonder about it a lot but he's like he's completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nExperienced scared the heck on moving\nA can of it but I Believe it I mean to actually be dying dying and then\nLeave your body that's something you got to remember how may still young guys only like forty years always got a lot of life ahead of it but he now has a very religious person but uh he encountered that statement but the one that I count there was a very different like I tell you that the ...\nYou know what was the first episode for huge on this demon showed up what\nAre they okay so let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of Jersey right Nicole neck area I have a house that sounded like an acre property\nNot far off Hoboken argue\nAbout forty five um that's a good hour though oh are you from ...\nI'm sure not sure what to do [laughter] oh yeah well I was born in Brooklyn that that that far from home\nBut now I live in New Jersey so oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire you know I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped sending at night I Love bartending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people that feel sorry for those people and that's the big ...\nBig prerequisite of why I had to separate but now I'm In New Jersey now so I'm doing fine yeah I have a very uh elaborate prayer life uh I I retired from my my my job as a special ed teacher retired are not working at night and I miss those people a lot to\nHave this like house at a time they were profit okay it's about a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come in to their house and the garages are under the house and you pull your car into the left and you go into the garage descendants a back door the commit to the garage\nAnd in between the garage and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they want to a little more room so I had the basement finished and a cut in half and I had an apartment building down there so I first white that's all he wants to more space that he moves down there yeah you have your own answer\nThe phone you're on the bottom to come and go as you want to say yes\nYeah so it's nice so then he goes to college and he looks out second boy watch as far as he takes it he goes to college and moved out by third boy he ... he was in there he he was head held high so he's a someone who had\nThe smart one free rent [noise]\nWell I didn't mind doing something that we had a big house and then like when he ... he went to count the votes out but he got a job\nAnd he said you know and I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we got a big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so I I like having to a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while and when you tell me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he got a great often took us but anyway he's here the whole time\nSo that stuff there and so and the basement you come in at that I indoor steps that go up to the kitchen the big get to know K if you're in that case and you can almost hear that door open and close and then next to the kitchen is living on that show I sit most of the time George and uh that's what I like I\nI got hit him in the morning then I meditate that afternoon I meditating at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for life and I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at that is a small little town that God gave me you know\nSo uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last so that I felt well lost almost every day for years and I like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nAnd then a bank yeah so that yeah\nI'm saying I'm sitting in the liver and that I endorse downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy like slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from ... and living off right but I hear it's flat like it never with lamb before and I'm thinking to myself\nRight I hear it's slanted like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in a house that twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking I said what what's out there but I don't think my wife could even if he came home a slant that like I don't even think that getting slammed that do that hard\nAnd maybe my son can I don't know why he would do it I looked at a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up\nI go to the kitchen I looked down see somebody comes in down near the foot ... and the lights on still talk to you so I go into the room and I have a a surveillance system here I think twenty minutes I think nobody was on the property\nI look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage though is I look at the camera they say that during the ... nobody went through that back\nDoor and a\nDistinctly heard it all\nOh absolutely slam no like plant\nI didn't know at at the time so that we're going to discuss this this creature was using its methodology on me and how to mess if it wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passenger with\nNow explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in a house seat this on lock them and jumped out do so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trust me I think I couldn't see them so I go if I turn the lights on in the basement I go down to the basement looking everywhere\nThen you're pretty convinced you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely absolutely but I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel if menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an evil\nThan a looming over use\nYeah looking everywhere I look down the steps that look anyway somebody could squeeze himself into behind a washer and dryer and my son's room underneath his bed in his closet you know and the furnace who am I look I look at my friend take a look and I still have this horrible feeling\nSo I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broke in but I still have this really menacing finished the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down\nAnd think about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThe ... steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and here's something that really heavy because like I get here when my wife comes up the steps a hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up the stuff the hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down like where I guess something very silly crossing those steps\nAnd thinking to myself I just checked down you know and nothing was here\nWith somebody coming up\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the steps I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you armed or own armed that time I have I have a gun you know you do okay [laughter] but I\nWhat I didn't say anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras I looked through the cameras if I Would assume something then I I I didn't feel like I you know but I don't think I kinda was wondering if we had that feeling of something very menacing sinister\nAnd I don't think it is but could this possibly thing but then I tried to shake it off to us because he like I'm just a guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to have you on where you convinced that was this creature demon in the house\nWhen it actually I actually had the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell you we're running out of time so we got to get to know really yeah oh ... uh that we have another hour though you know we're taking calls in our\nCase so okay so my wife comes home he said if it's the first thing that comes in is like a\nA a you know it's everything All right with you I was everything right where they have to feel something really we're in this house and I was like yeah but I Do too low you know but I don't know how to explain it she says so she's sitting there and I didn't know one of the time that this this creature who was here with Sally was telling us is here as says especially in the house is in control of the house it was using this methodology on and\nSo on us so I mean and then I realized that at the time I was already naive about it then I and then my wife to sit next to me on on the on
