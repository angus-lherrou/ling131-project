throughout the fourth age Byron Isaac Asimov three laws robotics let me quickly go through them and tell me how they would really transform into artificial intelligence\nOne robot may not enjoy June bean or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to us by human beings except for such orders would conflict with the first law\nThree a robot much protect its own existence is longest such protection does not conflict with the first or second law\nProtection does not conflict with the first or second law so what are you saying is is robots can't injured human beings at any cost that is kind of like in conflict with the ... you know soldiers not a robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the laws are\nAre are literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um you know if I'm going to do something dangerous potentially harm myself does the robot according to those laws intervene and stop me if I if I order a second dessert\nAnd I got a few extra pounds on me that's the real let's say no you can't have the desert because that's gonna hurt you I've got to save you got to protect\nExactly I'm monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whatever it exactly\nExactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots says no two people\nKind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't and even if you just sort of all we're just going to pick you know Joe\nAnd make a news Joe's moral code for all the robots even chose moral code is like full of providers and while you don't do that unless it's this but if they're all you know they're all of these is\n... and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots but have ethically and like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nLose a robot out there called ... which uh I I'm going to try to do an interview with so few because it talks and the you know it's styled after a woman but uh I'm going to call it in it because it's a robot but\nYou can ask a question and it'll give you a response isn't it czar\nI'm unfamiliar unfamiliar with it or you know I think if you ask a question just asking what's bigger a nickel or the side\nAnd it probably doesn't no\nNo no I mean it it it they don't have an incredibly narrow range of things that they can talk about uh if you ask any thing like um\nYou know a wide as Mr T. pity the fool or a ... anything just asking anything uh aside from how do you feel or anything like that decides to get anything about live\nAnything weird you will be a blue ended\nUm even something like\nThe kind of thing that you might ask or any other person you meet like I'm given the simplest problem you can\nThese these

looks like a person and you give it a person's voice and it says words\nYou're kind of in the back of your head going to say oh that's really thinking right right it's if you if you say no that's just\nYou know that that is not if they made it look like I'm a vase they all of a sudden the illusion would be broken\nLauncher and I we saw maybe than somebody hidden away in a corner talking

was and it all started like a like a waterfall just on top of my head all just started to happen\nYou find that the need to know more and more\n[noise] um [noise] different ones happen at different times I can be in a restaurant now and uh I Can't focus because there's too many people\nAnd I mean yeah it it some time and and so I've tried to I've been to use\nThe food that bad [laughter] depends where you're eating [laughter]\nI think that\nYou know I I think that our our loved ones that have passed um you know\nOur our loved ones that have passed um you know they see folks that are kept in as beacons and they come to them and I think that at certain times maybe my lights a little brighter than others\nAnd they just start gravitating and I'm just I kinda like half to push you know I actually physically move my arms and my hands back I've not right now luckily my friends and my colleagues have got used to\nBe doing that I'd like you before the break Tomas\nStory Unabomber yeah just\nI got one\nFor those of you that aren't familiar with Los Angeles the four oh five\nMajor freeway is\nThe ... dam of freeways um\nFive hundred thousand people a day traveling the four or five just to give everybody a perspective I take the four or five every day to work\nAnd\nThis one particular morning\nUm I ... you know I I call people whether friends or work on on my way in which he like many I'm probably an hour in the car this particular morning nobody picked up the phone call five people and no one picked up so I get on to the four or five and I'm Around at Sunset Boulevard\nAnd um my radio is everything is off I have my left hand on the steering wheel and I hear a voice as clear as you can hear mine right now that says put your other hand on the wheel\nIf your phone rings don't look at it in fact don't answer it and then there was a pause and then the voice said there's ... there's going to be an accident\nSo I have my hands ten and two looking around you know it's a four or five so you can't move lanes in rush hour known\nShowing her and her mom Perot you worse\nDoc [noise] although we we move if those who know the traffic flow you actually move once who um are going south on the four or five past sunset so I'm moving and then once I hit hit will share of the two cars in my line in front of me collide\nSwipe hump on my breaks to let the folks behind me know something's happened and then I slam on\nMine hoping you don't get a smashing them\nWell right but see I was ... I I was ready so I was prepared to knowing that I needed to do that and the situation is coming so um I you know I fortunately didn't hit anyone no one hit me and I checked to make sure everybody's okay get back then car I called my wife Suzanne\nAnd I tell her what happens and she said you were just so calm and I'm like yeah I Know I it's I was ready and she asked\nWho it was and I said I don't know and she goes with the Mona and I'm like no it wasn't moan and just everybody knows the Mona is was one of our best friend that was killed in a car accident five months after my mother died of Alzheimer's so I was getting like the double\nDuty of grief and I said it was a man's voice\nAnd she was she was like oh do you think that while I'm like I still don't know and she said call Patricia and see if she knows I'm Patricia I'm bank ends or owns the crystal matrix and Atwater village and she is a brilliant psychic and gifted teacher she's incredible\nAnd sells really great crystals and stone so either way than many in Los Angeles as interested and as I call Patricia and\nAnd I tell her story and she goes oh my that sounds\nLike that was your spirit guide because I've never heard such specificity she goes you know Julie we're born with spirit guide to kind of not just through life and if we're willing to be open in less than they were there to help us and I said well it's a really good thing because I kind of hurt that woman in the car in front of me and she has no baby\nIt wasn't a woman in front of you their life that your guide with saving it was yours [laughter] that's right\nI Want oh\nOkay no change you well\nIt it in a second it did\nSo I go to work have a weird day 'cause I'm thinking you know what a crazy morning\nThat ... that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives in Cincinnati and Pam is Mona sister who was killed Pam within the car when it happened so it was ... husband who sustained permanent brand brain damage of as of today from that accident [noise]\nFor the call Pam tells the story and she says huh\nShe want to hear the other half of your story\nAnd I said sure she said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you call this one I had the phone in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to go reach for the phone\nBut I was paralyzed couldn't move\nShe said imagine what would have happened\nIf I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today\nShe's like yeah he was good and so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nSure and the big lesson is about paying attention\nPeople say what's your book about and I so I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you the pay attention\nAnd trust yourself when you treat you teach mhm are you aiming at something or does it just\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I sat this age pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it was an ad and all burned out yet [noise] and um I've learned was\nThat smoke as like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pulled a smoke around them I could see their shapes either form\nAnd without the smoke do we're not there you could not see them\nWithout the smoke I could still see goes but not as clearly and easily and as reliable\nAs with the smoke\nAmazing gift you know there was this Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work is goes to talk for a second hour we will open up the phone lines has\nSigned up to recoup soon breed email newsletter Google dot com\nOh\n\n\n\nMan will come back to coach the girls were back with Julie ... book is called the ghost photographer I loved the subtitle of course is interested in ... were you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I was sitting with my publisher she was asking me about some of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs and looked like they ... out of movies that I've marketed\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world of may leave I sit isn't that crazy during the day I mean make believe and then at night\nYou'd come true it kinda throws [laughter]\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did what happened well times yeah you know when we can start going weird hair in a minute if he won two because some of the things I encountered um are\nAre strange and some are scary and you know I found at times um\nAnd and this is where the Claire sent in really that bad gift comes in to comes in very handy um where I can feel\nUm if there is a at a bad entity an evil entity that is around and I learned something really important for folks to understand um and that is if you if if they find themselves\nWhere they have it go in their house they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear and their body all they have to do\nIs be in charge because they are in charge because it's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe\nYou can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert ear human ... like dominance like you you can get rid of a seven like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes\nAnd I started weirdly because I again my Oklahoma at ... am upbringing I was raised with his ... and so I knew the Lord's Prayer hadn't used for really long time um\nAnd do the dirty work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were um you know dark ferrets around as I Would start saying though I like I started seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I ... there's something there\n... you're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ...\nI mean when you think we all are telling the truth is that while I was gonna say do you think everybody has this capability but you have or ... or are you unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to tap into yes\nI have a friend that is the most incredible medium evil ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen by the number\nOf into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know perhaps I have\nYou know a few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into of course media in a big way ... you Google ghosts when you were experiencing this how come\n[noise] you know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right any or\nHave you have the kind of hear reality you want to see if you want to know you're not the only one\nAnd I think I was looking to see how common are uncommon right the physically the photograph did you get answers um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really\nKind of eased my nerves and then [laughter] and then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them in that movie the witch and did you ain't you haven't seen the which\nAre you have not seen you haven't seen that there was a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the film which trial and I'm\nDavid in Hawaii who is the kind of friend advise the producer and and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlet from back in the day\nAnd there's a scene where the father or at the end families circled around I'm the son who is um a as F.\nAnd he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nThat they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of start shaking\nUm because there was a there was a a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDividing rod to find them\nThe mining rod to find them to know\nAnd and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me the\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this stuff started happening to me and there was no instruction book you know I was able to identify were Ghost World I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of his space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou would go about that\n... were well\nIt was just like the old syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this\nWell we could be medical\nI could be\nCould be people who cannot rely just because they can't ... syndrome and then you realize you know you you are where you can get a lot of it but I also heard of ... ... basically Perot watch\nYeah what I've heard what I read about and well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me stories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYou don't want to June ... I I I'm a friend and her on Facebook and I read her book I think Rudy is tremendous expert on the house she\nAbsolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing um and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm a friday right\nHe had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he\nModeled Freddie Krueger\nBased on the hat man\nBecause it came to him that's right and nightmares right was it\nWas interesting with Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now I'm a certified trans coastal therapist so I've\nBeen a big way now when I started to yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George let's do it just take a few pictures that goes I may go all the way\nThrough it [laughter] no I'm doing\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened [noise]\nAnd I learned about the stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful lock it is not the prettiest rock in their purse booking them but it's really a powerful and it's and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting on the counter [noise]\nUm it's been studied by the curious and also by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been\nA lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians and those just like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it and um and I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex Alex with us on your night stand\nI said I have a feeling that it has a enough of a range to it but it will protect you while you sleep\nAnd it did a big one\nIt helped him to where the only time he had another experiences when he left his rock at home\n[noise] and then I started using it for friends that had kids that had night terrors\nThose kids haven't had night tear sense had another friend sleep paralysis gave her the same thing\n... quickly has been brought to you by

like well do you actually believe I said how can how can I not\nHow can I cannot believe you know it was in my backyard\nI Wonder if these movie two or three of these movies you dealt with are coming alive\nWell sure I have a different philosophy what if it's possible that those that are actually making the movies are seen them themselves what Walt Disney saw all of those creatures that he put in his movies what I call them fantastical benefit I use\nThe word and then you create homes and created them when he saw them they should\nThey be creating money some whatever that what if this is an has nothing to do with me what is that they actually do exist and those at that create um actually also see them somehow\nWell some of the great directors of our lives are like you were people like
