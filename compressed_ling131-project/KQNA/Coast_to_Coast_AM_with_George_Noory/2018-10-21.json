FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him\nAnd are you certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is it is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like ... percent unemployment and the banks failed to paint the picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had a roaring economy going and of course I mean remember remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWhere it started out starting to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in an official with the knowledge and lovers and raised a few taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this is explosion of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in order so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the grammar paycheck\nAnd um this was the experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nHis friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence but either way and then you're a New York city or and so it misses was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd there was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking food to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put everyone to work on the government do so we can have the\nCradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing we're we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all those new wonderful\n... valleys in capitalism I think you meant the I think is the communist instead of ...

I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was re out of almost like the communist manifesto that they had to kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly\nIt certainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to um you know he he just went crazy um\nThe great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nWill write what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought okay\nSo well all of this was going on in Europe is great ... you know he used to seeing lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it\nSo if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nUm and they started to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize the\nSubstantial portion is over or unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed than it was\nI mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books history books say a lot of things uh I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie\nOf or economics or says he wasn't there was an economic failure\nPeople were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing\nAnd the you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services we were all you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean that was it was a it was a cat us it was a ... because I asked her the\nHow did he use the training with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease\nThere's news ... you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the same as the same thing with the with the wind lease program\nHe was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to the the the access powers and he was given to the to our allies you know a free France included and eventually this new Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back in the wintertime\nSo there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal was not working so there was there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where\nHe knew that we had to get into this war\nAnd the spies in deep and you know we have spies too I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have um we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your heavy water experiments and with the beats who rockets to carry the nuclear weapons all for instance the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brand so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time of his\nIt was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nToo in the book you argue as many as ... a man that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um but then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen Beatty let it happen or when he just sort of glad it happened\nYou know I I say in my book that I think you have to be I was probably the greatest war president we ever had and that's because he just loved war he didn't everything to make World War two happened and I might catch flak for that but you know what the words too bad it's true All right um the Japanese were their oil debtor nation meaning they don't create enough oil to\nRun what they have to do in their country\nSo they're getting our oil from us they were coming off a huge war with China they didn't last thing they wanted was to go to war

accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communists completely frustrated at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure it on the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating is White House so\nLeaving example of give me an example in in ... White House of some of the the communist and they had here\nFor the first communist overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um after\nThat were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were there were hundreds of at least Fifteen high ranking officials enough the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder us\nAnd they were in all kinds of different er and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety and I'll talk about Harry Hopkins of the er at length later so they don't get bored on the way it's more common [laughter] um\nThe or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOf the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department [laughter] U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people\nSo I mean he was just communists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually was the HHS secretary of state\nHe was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know\nObviously every FDR couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk the style and and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the CPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way and like I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins gallon get on\nFamously\nHe was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could live my lease program to help the Soviets out So Harry Hopkins ... famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute\nOr he was Harry happens afterwards fire afterwards was angered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name I'm old egg groove I ski and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB the factors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union about uh the the than on a project which of course we all know was a nuclear weaponry so\nHere we have I mean there are informants and spies all around the FDR so so the point where they egos are that's wrong conference\nYou know I mean I feel a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt when they're meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible\nHow how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of the Nazis weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him Stalin why the information the right he had plans in the post war world of taking America was half communist anyway\nHe had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right\nBut how this all happened was prior to this of course this is a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for\nWell Stalin had sent invitations to um to the directors of Hollywood a union leaders a college professors who the target\nAnd they would were sent invitations all expense paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city and the city's name is escaping me at the moment it is are listed in my book\nIn the they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was care for on how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this fear countrymen because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nI I had an author on a couple years ago who wrote a book about standing land now and they tried to recruit anyway you had loudly\nSo it was a fictitious town that didn't exist there was made a cardboard and basically so\nThe village Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meaning our country\nAnd to this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so\nThere's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings in the spring party by Stalin spelling is the puppet master he uh he's this guy he managed to accomplish\nIn his life was incredible he was one of the six original members of the votes should their revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of style and he was nothing more than a he was to keep the party journals and use the column\nComrade or was it come Conrad index card used to call them the gray blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party\nOne by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nThe Senate style I'm Sorry I'm Lenin wrote that in his or the quote from lens will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin to death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nMurder I gotta I gotta jump in here Steve will take a timeout Wilson again taking us into the break with everybody needs somebody and then more on who murdered FDR stay with us here in coast to coast than [noise]\nPlus ... transfer credits

Stalin and most really going on Rick\nOr anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well it never ceases to amaze uh when I just wanted to take them anything because people need to know like ... you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late\nSo I'm I wanted to talk about you know it's so much of the post world are so much of the post war world\nIs a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that really is a result\nOf FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference and you also in forty four when when that post war world was really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt spray all condition or and and um FDR really didn't know what happened do you just went so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference\nAnd obviously he's he's he looks like death warmed over seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with him what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with him\nUm as far as being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of poison and see where are you thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and\nWhat they were poisoning with with something that was plentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet\nBut the rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know\nI don't think grandpa Walden would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning exposure to that isn't always boys and I said the time so\nFDR as being slowly poisoning from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenating himself\nHe starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so ... started me on this whole thing of FDR\nI thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in the tiny margin Eighteen days a Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently it'd be on the door I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people ask me it would just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's longer I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period I said you know wait a minute I I really got to look into this I didn't believe that in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] yeah but in the book you point out how\nHis his doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral a navy admiral mcentire\nHis personal physician and his his cardiologist Dr Howard brew in they were they had no idea what was going on with him they were doing X rays and taking doing all of these tests they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work with what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the fans of polio and this and that and the other thing in\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre\nWho's the White House physician who was also the vice admiral and in a certain sort of the journal of the navy um you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course of the navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of Perry allergy but as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea what they do is they take him to the doctor\nSo what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would do normal and then it would go it would go warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something\nAnd it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard to every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they got to this point they said look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again\nYou know we've got to get to the bottom of what the hell's going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day Dr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy in America at the time [laughter]\nSo he examines after the march in Nineteen forty four and um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel\nBasically saying that this was a dead man walking and do what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR is being slowly poison\nStyling Stalin got him I can tell you that I'm styling wants to FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter the hour he wanted to set up the former policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share of the world with\nUncertainty Stalin didn't want to share of the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world he was a megalomaniac look at what he didn't Soviet Union\nOf course we know that then it wasn't\nWasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S I on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aid died conveniently also on the brain and your as\nWell there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was power Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way like I Believe in that surround conflicts dies on this ship\nCerebral hemorrhage\nHe gets back he being FDR he gets back a short time later I'm FDR's personal secretary also and the Americans are in relation to the doctor Ross McIntyre he dies of history real hemorrhage\nThe drug of the day is more free rat poison\nAnd its powerless tasteless voter lists and its circulating all over the place as a matter of fact style and got murdered was rat poison or friend\nFrom in from the internal ... governor that came out later as well so there's a lot going on or friend is not what got FDR would have been to sudden it would have thrown up too many red flags okay\nStyle wouldn't want it to deal with Harry Truman he wanted to deal with Harry Truman 'cause he wasn't as political savvy or so he thought\nHe knew that FDR was um a tremendous mine and he couldn't outsmart them okay\nSo here's you know this had to happen um for someone to get his way and we he had been so infiltrated or government with the everywhere everywhere as a matter of fact to thicken the plot FDR dies in front of two Russian Spies\nOr he was having this portrait painted in Elizabeth as soon as off um she was a Russian she was over here\nWe're the talk of Guam communities

an alien based on the moon is dead\nIn Seventy four year old wolf who had worked at tactical air command at Langley air force base in Virginia during the Nineteen sixties and was killed earlier this week after being hit by a trailer while cycling in Lansing New York at wolf had written defame back in two thousand and one\nAfter claiming to have seen photographic evidence of extraterrestrial structures on the far side of the moon\nAnd during his time in the air force he had worked as a photographic surveillance technician\nWhich is mostly involved in working with the machines that process video footage recorded in Vietnam\nOn this particular occasion however he had been asked to report to the an essay facility on the base to help with the processing of some images taken during a recent lunar mission while he was there another airman showed him a photographic mosaic comprised of images taken during multiple patches of the lunar orbiter\nHe claimed that it showed a base on the moon's fireside\nUm I think it was his ballet and he would do would you would give you a lay out a picture of cream and some cruel or oatmeal or something and then it's ... it's been described as a glass of green liquid\nOr how they get it in ... in a glass of green like Clinton was that the doctor when they connected us now\nI I you know\nI'd love to say I know everything about this I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt had was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with this\nUm and she commissioned a private investigator to uh to the bottom of this stuff so\nI Do know that um the private investigator hit a dead end all of that the medical records were were stolen from a lot filing with us though so one of four people had those keys one of them was a doctor\nAnd a ... it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote um\nThe uh the book being um the White House physician and that was a Ross and Ross mcentire were they hand on the murder I have absolutely no idea I I I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little ignorant maybe and\nAnd what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she went on how\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well\nThey packed up the uh um uh Robbins and shuts off and they threw was Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others\nUm [laughter] and um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book um her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the plight that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia\nWhich I saw was a little crazy because if it was a natural death um you know why I don't know why would you like to flee the scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and then there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a diet of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the now the law was\nThe same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the pathologist so\nBoth you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both ... both as though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know a lot of this besides the couldn't talk you know and then they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death to him being being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo nor did by the way and no one bombing\nNo autopsy non bombing\nIt just went crazy here and crazier and crazier all the way through\nSo I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this\nI'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that a murder that they've lost over um Warren Harding Warren Harding was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but\nAs far as FDR is concerned I mean\nBut as far as FDR is concerned I mean the the the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still\nBoggles my mind you know the book is going to publish for a little while now and I still even after the book is unpublished you know I'll find a new fact then they go wow I should have put that in the book I mean it's about\nThe volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here a ... an Alabama in the wild card line any good morning locked because\nI think he's a ... I'm calling to ask you about some written ... she was several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party and she shoots ... aunt who work at the state department and there's your mind now\nI'd also like to ... can experience with the blood there prescribe for my grandmother which was more for in a college ... hands strings however it looked like British constantly bleeding all in the body Montana and it can cause in your in from\n\nThere you go but you don't use it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\n[noise] yeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with or for him because it\nAnd she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to the point where if you touch a person's they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or cerebral much then they'll also of course I Know Dr but my parents are both on it they're both on a variety of blood\nAnd her so right my late father was as well sure that's really caused brood any thanks for calling on\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nYeah my mom had their good morning okay it quick odd sleepover to an outlet in over the ad for me I look for um a gentleman on the\nWet head top play well off so believe had ... like I I'd I'd like to know if he had no way and the nice in theory around it I ... ... and what it had to go after that we would be someone that would talk about that new the new deal\nI mean I wouldn't have I hang around that that it off for the great depression\nAnd I like it though I can I add and lastly ... about both a direction connection and a bowl of FDR and miss a towering stable genius people will and the White House\nAnd have somewhat different because at the cat right and then they can entertain to add more to do it leading up you know even now he wound up as president\nAnd of course the money that he had to go to encounter I can get re be a guide like lab but right on ... and and now they they don't see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he had a public ... teens and ...\nMy if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's not to put words in your book but I think you are being kind of see shifts\nAre about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to to FDR where we could do a whole show perhaps another time on the Russian dusty and so forth\nBut and you're right Webster sharply a big fan of FDR I Know Webster and their bed and had dinner with him and then he waxes on above the new deal uh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go because I Want it to my knowledge has never been done before so I mean\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so as far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of little facetious as to how how everyone is in our history you kind of repeats itself but kind of doesn't\nYou know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter]\nWe were right back in the same thing we have another red scare them in the country it's it's really it's really something ... you know it would really enjoy those rising\nRight so I think it points making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from CNN to nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with Trump which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how how how to reach another red scare it's starting to repeat itself all over again\nAnd here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is ... repeats itself becomes relevant actually interesting book I think you'll like it thanks for last night for going\nWe will uh we're heading into a break here at the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of us we can\nAnd here's the Reverend Al Green I'm so tired of being alone taking a break on coast to coast am\n\n\n\n\nDidn't come\nAnd I think he would prefer the story was that he will prior to ... he won that runs dealt with ... break them up for the call that the Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of but truly I I Can't buy the fact that uh that's all I Want her to death I I think he did not want him to want to deliver minority pop like that that just mark my take on it\nAll right thank you John ... bad shape you're going to die anyway All right Stephen and you want to reply [noise]\nUm\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have known slanted okay I'm not suggesting that what you said has been\nHe looks Sylvana Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison that's why he look so bad in Nineteen forty four\nThis wasn't from the advance on polio and it spills out very very plainly and my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history is an awful lot of people who research this and I learned from every one of them I'm not going to sit here and professor know every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as silenced I Want one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR\nSo if he sent something to look in the ... in the end of the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died so if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that I didn't if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know give recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of false propaganda\nI John thank you for that to me interesting point there ah let's see how the genes in Philadelphia\nHi James good morning welcome to Costco\nThank you Richard I'm like I guess for my question for Mr Thing it's just there's so many and in your research physical\nOr did you come across or anything about this just to just stole that attempted coup against so Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a show happening and it costs us ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... one of the people involved was a I think was the Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come the happening\nIf it if it did happen if there was an attempted coup\nAgainst Roosevelt\nComing at you discussing the book or is it sees\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information but it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did\nUm and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are around
