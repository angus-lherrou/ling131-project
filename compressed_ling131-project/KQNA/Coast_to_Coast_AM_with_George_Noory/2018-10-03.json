D democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations that have a have a form of democratic government so it's gone from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech or religion the rule of law lemonade show slavery\nWomen's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer oh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's going to collapse overpopulation of pollution we wrote always terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nGee what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most\nHeartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it what do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because\nUh we have very low cost electricity um a price us here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all year the nations in Europe have higher or electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nRight now where the biggest petroleum political producer\nOr we should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're either not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to\nDo that during a cold weather

to be the question that most people want answered\nWell there are many um\nYou know I speak to businesses and one of the things I I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate was on the energy laws are foolish in many ways the headlines are grip by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different\n... of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in a majority [noise] ah so it's a little bit of a strange situation um\n[noise] let's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm\nAre they concerned about anything [noise]\n[noise] well they've you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations and the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change predicted that ah temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade or with a max of five ten so low of too tense and if you put those on the chart\nThose rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're we're below the estimates for the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the\nThe rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nTo draw on Long Island New York to east of the Rockies to Joe go ahead\nA state interesting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but a lot of questions\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question what they are we just had a and a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned\nThat was supposed to be a beacon now was working with the people kind of any of this thing so\nI I relate this to a\nMotion tampered shows how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that a second question would be a political climate you know ... boy talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as see a\nYou know ... are in his shoes and a and a ... you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study and never or the tourist\nAnd really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they'd cut Guam course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and math really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to take on trial is already gotten blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post and uh that my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... industry or was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO to really look at Chanel ball\nThat's still only buried at still active it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles so the place where all these years later\nSo it kind of New York for example you got to the point right man I'm a big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens is New York city\nSo you had a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of 'em one was uh what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of them out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on the ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people will take him on ships and kind of measurements that are going around and those were very accurate and if he um [noise]\nThe thing you said about uh what's um let's see the ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need to solve its I Need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants so most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems fail fail\nLike happened with the ... in Japan then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with no clear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant\nAnd I think the third one was\nUm satellites but you said something about governments and what's your question yeah I'm\n... I think you know a ... defeated about five times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of of you know arguably more than half of the United states members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem I most of those are on the Republican side of course [noise]\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it\nUh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so I'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we got as an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in render a useless wherever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again of the ah if all those little ... go off in Antarctica melt of big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue there's many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is an ice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the study is a huge\nWe we've got against Robert Felix who believes in early stage of an ice age ...\nWho knows Walter in Pennsylvania taken away well go ahead\nBy George you know needless to say great talking to once again George thank you Walter\nGeorge junior up with all due respect Mr Gore on sounds a lot like a\nDoctor Kimball ...\nCharge with all due respect to grow them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited and all I think George I think it's just common sense\nAbout the human population on this planet cannot increase out in the mind them\nNow you know George we share this planet with myriad other species on\nModern library cultural may have a lot of the uh [noise]\nYou know the ancient a bane of law in modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat in Africa the human population eat driving in the hour he thought station as in this country\nYou know we have large me a lot of the great a herd of buffalo bites and\nOh so you know naturally you couldn't twenty million a\nShouldn't hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't Mad Men would be compatible with our agriculture with a bias and wildly wrong we have law expansion fields of corn and soybeans and wheat so uh\nYou know I think it's common sense about the human population\nWell the human population\nCannot including shot in a lot of them\nAre well there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that the Weaver radically transform the surface of the earth\nAh we're certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think we're sixty million by some at one time estimates\nAre those days are gone there are some good news there are some good news by the way Dr Ehrlich of the one set of he was a betting man he predicted by the year two thousand England would no longer exist because of population growth fees\n... one of the guys this may be wrong or the most time said publicly in history there are some good there are some good news things one is\nUm ah we actually reached peak agricultural land according to the nation state of the the total amount of land\nHas been brought to you by preppy bell eating and going\nTo talk of the quad cities eleventh hour game change you in a brigade rally Ninety nine point nine FM pay to speak the ...

know with a big grin on their face [noise] listening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe that\nThere was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive ... blog use any claim that he shot too big for it and had them and of course\nI don't know what happened to the guy and I definitely don't know what happened to the reported ... what are those kinds of stories in your opinion on Senate or made up\nWell you know\nWhat are we talking about George we're talking about one person\nIt's like a he said she said\nRight I Believe me the proof\nI Believe that\nThese people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it and um\nThe man who is not being paid he could have easily just shut up and walked away he didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know uh he was reporting on what had happened and the fact was\nHe like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it [noise] uh having seen it they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions and so they buried them\nA I've had a couple of encounters a where animals have been killed was said to have been killed one of them are words in self defense\nAnd a dismantle the thing was going to kill him a and what are you to say about that at my say you know you all wrong for doing that\nYou should of you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I can imagine\nThere and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if you'd like I could um well done no let me let you continue I have so many things here I could\nShow we will do that and we've got a break coming up in a couple of miniature show up at\nUh like I said I have some people uh\nWho have seen bodies a couple of guys say they shot them and as far as the bugs are concerned\nI thought he knew his firearms I thought he knew his a bullet [noise]\nAh it didn't seem seem very real to me and there's a lot of people uh down south uh ended his neck of the woods\nThat do go out on the night on a I have a couple of uh accounts with guys who are out hog hunting feral hogs\nAre which is becoming a big problem down how it's huge and it's right\nAnd there are people actually being hired out now by a farmer's land owners are because they're in fear of their children are getting attacked by the boards and whatnot\nThat hiring people to go on their property they go out at night they have lights they're riding around some of them have electric basically golf cart so they could ride around rather a stole fillet\nAnd they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on somebody's I personally I think there shoveling against the tide\nBut um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down a thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had a call ... year ago from an individual who was fishing and he caught two trials and he said as soon as he kind of realized what was going on she saw a big flood looking at him about eight feet away\nAnd he said he's holding the two trials the guy is in the big ...\nAnd he went oh my God what am I going to do so\nIn a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot in the big took them\nLooks at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy called and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you a that is most or one of the most unreal stories\nOr if I heard that I Would have discounted it are entirely however having said that I had a gentleman was canoeing in Vermont and he had taken a lake in to a creek\nAnd its hold on to that story William we're going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I always had suspects about that the fishing story but let's get yours when we come back\nCoups insiders the new version of that goes to goes to a a map is now available for I'm going to know Android ... listen live on demand anywhere any time going to cause to go to um dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nSpeech at three seven nine one three to ... a seat you three ... three [noise]\n\nAnd welcome back to the cultural here was William she's the author of the big foot terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on\nYes yes uh well this gentleman was a canoeing in a creek up in Vermont and really he was poured urging stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd uh he was lining up some trials on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping on the side of the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up for dinner so he had caught a few brook trout\nLate I'm On the rock and\nWhen he turned over Detroit we're gone now\nHis first instinct was that a raccoon took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happen to me finishing that connect quiet river or wherever I heard a little rustling the bushes and I turned to my head and a rainbow I had laying up on the side of the river\nOr I see a raccoon stick it on the left and right grab it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought\nSo ... a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at all most ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish not just one fish in one school grabbed numerous fish\nAnd retracted back into the weeds [noise] [noise] and that when he saw that [noise]\nIt was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that\nWhere it had reached out at ground level his tent was set up a buck fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his mind and started to make its way out with the canoe but he had said that\nThought it was a big ... obviously what else has a long hair rearming began turning standing out of the bushes and then you also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly or the other which will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nAnd you're gonna buddy and was\nAble to know that he was pushing swore him fishing sure he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where we could get up there and get the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him\nWhen he saw the first group of finish missing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe and he had his peripheral vision looking out towards Iraq now\nNow being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter] what he caught was not a raccoon at all\nAnd uh he was pretty it was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports hotter people described the creature in terms of tight ... big how big\nIt will it it really varies I Would say\nA minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a\nAnd I had a ... point he had\nA a lot of people say the comical shaped said there's varieties of ... a hair for coloration ranging from like salt and pepper chew a lot of people use the term or burn or read\nA and then of course brown and black sort of seems to be a variety and then we have today from basically for the\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of ... almost ... body very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described it as being like a weightlifter or a ... you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the nth degree type of body extremely muscular\nOr the chest you know Bolger Utah is you know just like a real monster so these are things that people are seeing and it it just varies a I had one I'm\nOne story called the tree stand a incident I named it\nWith Israel and claimed that his trees stand who's twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet and this sasquatch and a group of other fast watchers\nIt seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was bow hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning but he had said\nHe recognized as a hunter that these our Moises will not real in other words they were being mimicked and as he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces sasquatch snuck up on him\n[noise] a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grab the heel of his book [laughter] I\nThink about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong in this measurement nobody sits did Tristan ten feet off the ground\nI mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his people read I don't know Seventeen something had to have tremendous height and reach but the amazing thing about that story was the way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boot\n[noise] and he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost stored that it just wanted him to know that it could do that that it could sneak up on him and ...\nAnd then left the scene and everything went quiet again\nYou know the name of your book big chair in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big for\n... I ... I take the stand as to\nWhat is more terrifying is it ... is it not enough terrified to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder road or is it more terrifying to have one linking you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people\nA lot of the encounters a somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people that exit hastily but then there's other encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion the chasing the people out\nThey want to monitor the region for somebody they\nDon't want them now and I think if you push the envelope or\nAre you going to be in the sorry state of affairs or when you talk about this gentleman that city had to fish and the the big for walked over and gave him to him [laughter] he gave a one back telling me right now George\nThat big foot if I see that big foot I'm going to get wheels like pop up on a can of citizens or [laughter] you know we're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a car running out of the\nWilliam does anybody ever report be the big ...\nI have a I Do have an account or this is very interesting another fisherman and here's the thing George\nI Believe that\nAside from the accidental sightings which there are numerous ones the vast majority of these sightings of being hand by people who are out there doing things that your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal normal but\nThey're doing things were involved in things that the average person does not do the hunters and fishermen there in remote areas uh the loners they're people who are getting out and going into places for peace of mind to exercise whatever the case may be\nAnd in so doing they enter into this realm where these creatures seemed to be a no getting better than what we were just talking about I just said\nWhere were you were talking about these creatures but do people talk about the big\nYes yes I'm Sorry a so this gentleman\nWas at a small waterfall and a ... a I Believe it was mean and he was finishing this river and he had commented that the ... the noise from the full of their\n... quickly says been brought to you by pressing belly heating and cooling\nWe're in a jock at Guantanamo Bay so living sodium cake you in a ... you know Ninety nine point nine MK two sixty ...

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talked about would knocking that the people are hearing what's going on with that what's not to them well you know\nThis is one of the things that we we see on the television a relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nUh they apparently believes that this is some type of communication uh between big foot you knock they knocked back on the signaling each other in the woods\nBut this is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\nIt really disapproves ... knocked because according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a\nA semi pro landscape photographer a and he and his wife were in an area called lower crib tree meadows in twenty Seventeen July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them were walking into this area\nTo take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line\nFor sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional but he had been doing it for twenty five years and never considered themselves to be a professional\nAt any rate there in the valley taking pictures and there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and ... el ... there was nothing around\nAnd they heard a loud knock\nEmanates through the valley\n[noise] show he's got his cameras set up in the tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she still on scanning around [noise]\nAnd ... through a husband and I see something pacing around over there on the hill fried and he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside to\nLike show he swings this time around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through the years she's got it now he sees it and he says even though was so small in his lens that the distance he was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swimming it's arms up in the uh uh like you said the nervous\nMan waiting for a bus seem very alert to\n... yeah well a show then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the air like a Halloween ...\nPuts it stands by its side just like you will I Would do ...\n... voice forward and then they hear the knock you know I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click you told me get through the mouth [noise]\nYou've got at George was like only like you know thousands of them\n[noise] show\nIt wasn't a knock at all\nBut it was more like vocalization that the creature was able to do somehow with the stroke its tongue it smells who knows you can ask them questions\nBut he said it was not a knock at all so that was really interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nYou did in your opinion is is uh\nIt should be in your opinion is it is it a blight gr man like\n[noise] I don't know George I amplify aren't you hear it ... its its own thing you know it's\nAll you know like in in a pool walk on for very rarely will and they walk just standing up right it uses its arms and it's not cold on a move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really yeah I mean people have encountered them uh hitting all fours\nShe would look like a beer to me if it did that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a stranger encounter a this was called the balloon is fighting the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon rides\nHe always wanted one I got\nA he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it so that [laughter] they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field\nAnd uh he was scared out of his way to put the he fought through it and they went for a ride and if the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of way to them and said you let me know when you get really uncomfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland immoral and\nWhat\nHis what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight there were other people in the ... with them by the way it was like just him and his wife there were probably a five or six people and now\nThey got to a point where the pilot of the balloon load the balloon over a wooded area so that the ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know trying to grab belief off the tree and all of this then he lifted it back up again as they made it across the next field\nHe did it once again he loaded down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree up and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people carrying on in this scandal but here\nIn with their big for comes in when they're scraping over to second series of trees was bordering a field\nBusting out at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big fought he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at may\nEverybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing [noise]\nKept quiet and you can't control a balloon\nThis fellow said that after this thing think took\nSeveral you know very long and fast strides walking it hit the deck on all fours and took off he hid it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont grace you see that's unusual isn't it\nWell I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story in one of the books that cold along came a spider where these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you I had some accounts of ah feral hog on\nThese guys were hog hunting and they were hitting in a field uh coming up on dust waiting for the Hong Kong to come down the trees that were already so I'm Out in the field they were in the tall grass\nAnd the grass was sporadically patch and all the words here we're clear areas and areas of hardware aggress\nWorking your way around the field they sure what he described as a furry army how my thinking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like the dome of black for they were watching this thing moving through the grass\nIn spur similar to like a spider want to move quickly and stops moving quickly on shopped\nFinally they catch this thing coursing and opening between two patches\nAnd it's heading towards the hard that they were looking at which was still far away [noise] witness and came into the opening he said it look like at ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's Cory into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards Raj\nAnd then they were watching this thing is going up and one that stood up they knew it was a big foot and this thing made a lunging leap like Superman dive on to one of the Hong ...\nSome type of quick movement on on the ground and left the field with the hog under its all\nMore bizarre story William

available on Amazon and pay them back and in Kindle format\nSo you know you can have your druthers whether you're a a Kindle user or if you're like oh a paperback book which I kind of food even myself I like the feel of pages and touched\nA coven June ... old school but nothing wrong with that yup yup\nLet's go to Chicago Robert's with us to get things started hey Robert go ahead sir\nI get your insurance from Iran okay on as we can\nThank you wouldn't have to ask questions how long have you ever seen a photo of a tool or makes was set were captured and killed in Pennsylvania and around a little too settling the micro this this thing really looks like the real McCoy\nThis was in Pennsylvania now and it was sort of go Eighteen Seventy they're holding this one big caught up and the other big ... they have a man\nAnd the second question I have as you mentioned that your little some men that\nShot a big foot happened after the break ... was shot why would you go down like I should and what kind of weapons is a day of well\nHere's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania a what I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an interesting\nUh that came from a photograph taken from a grandparents' house after the ... final grandparent had died\nIn which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time uh that was set up a after Roosevelt pet established a uh the protection of the parks\nAre they needed to start making a eat grass and access to these parks in the structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and rangers stations so they had assembled this civilian core workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness\nIndonesian only protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men are in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men\nOne of these things came into the camp and tried dragging on demand off of this caught\nAny other men attacked it throwing a handout taxes and grabbing guns shooting at the thing as it ran a out of there ever a encampment\nNow but the odd thing is about these things [noise]\n[noise] it seems that shocked on fire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the fits into hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards so we're both barrels of a seven and a half lead shot\nAnd he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about a big what's being shot or in my county called the bullet this guy was hunting and um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountain center ridge line on three sides in front of him\nAnd he ran across what he described as a corn taught me that a stick\nHe said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lent itself to having this quantity of sticks and branch bows oh bows and branches formed and this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep a layer\nOf branches and ... as well for me what he thought was like betting\nSo his initial thought was that hunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown that change\nOn this line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the rich which started to charge in his direction down the hill now he estimated that this ridge line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill with impossible for a man to do when this thing broke the bases are rich\nHe estimated now than it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer to the heat level to fight on it and pumped around over its head thinking he was scary it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies\nWhen that that ah cyborg or whatever the heck they called it the Terminator robot was\nPosing as the police officer and how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping in like nothing could stop them even load is gone all fired a second round added he wished\nWhat has gone all fired a second round added he sure he hated it had no effect on them and they kept broadening\nHe fired off third and fourth around and think kept coming at him now was closing in squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why it named a story the bullet and it's finally drop and when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round\nHe got even closer to what he realized the thing was was not moving in that everybody's gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\n... first of all this guy shoot this thing is self defense he's in imminent danger or things coming at him like a bad out of health he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them\nAnd yet when he's short lying on the ground who can see that that had been warned did there was multiple blood patches where these bullets had actually hit it but why\nThese things can go now we all know if you go hunting\nIf you don't have a moon shot or an Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or hard shot some type of solid organs shot these things can run\nAnd hunters two moons there uh Corey not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures [laughter]\nIt seems like to me if you gonna take one of these things down it's gotta be a head shot\nIt's got to be in the neck or the ... or something ...\nMuch sadly they have to take them now\nWell I mean what are you going to do Georgia rhino\nR. by the way I looked at the picture of that Eighteen seventies syriza Bigfoot\nOr they didn't have photo shop in those days\nYou know
