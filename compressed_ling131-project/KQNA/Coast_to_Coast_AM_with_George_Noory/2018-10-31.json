wasn't so much about the that the life itself it was the fact that it was electronic media it was making this possible some record about media whether it was I hate 'em or in this case a CD\nWell in

to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and doing show take up you know some of the important background information\nBut yes it where it was difficult and I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand that but no matter how you want to approach the subjects whether you want to approach them to the skeptic or the fall on believer or the way that I liked to approach them more as a journalist and historian\nThat people are worried when you bring up or it's like ... natural are caught they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or\nIf you're coming at it from a from a way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I wanted to work with these subjects at all oh just problems sometimes when I'm asking

and an interest in with a and neo paganism right now I'm a lots of people who are experimenting and reading about writing about witchcraft\nUm so I just think that it overall there's an increase in people's needs to be seeking\nUm some alternative ways of thinking about a spiritual experience but I Do think that we just live in an age where you know information is just overload enough and so

want to chime in real quick on muscle angel thing I'm I'm I'm God believer a crisis follower and I make no bones about it obviously I come into this conversation with a little bit of a bias but\nUm I guess the caution I wanted to get to those those of us in the audience that are of like mind is that is to use caution with the amount of emphasis that you put on trying to seek out\nThe guardian angel aspect and and I get to begin dangerously close to worshipping the the angels in worshipping the people that God's putting our lives to help us I'm a father I've got a young kids and it wasn't until I got kids that are really understood this whole concept of love like I Do now\nI Believe God loves this very very deeply so much so we can't even understand it\nJust very very deeply so much so we can't even understand it and if my kid you know got hurt and got sick out whatever I needed a seeing eye dog for example and my kid loves the dog my kid lumps the dog but then my kids love my dog that I gave him to help him get through his handicap more than he loves me\nI guess as a father my heart would be heartbroken that I Would lose out on the phone relations but I Would have with my kid and I guess to the extent that many of us try to\nSeek out the angels more than we seek out God the father of God the creator I guess there's a danger and losing four relationship we can have with our

messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says back to him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have\nYou're on the other side a one word or something you're going to get an across and then they're going to know that you're there but\nI mean it was sharper than that Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets that cold\nThat she's the one that's right I Want to make sure it's her so she has five words in French that she gets back to come back to him so this was an ingenious code really that because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words alone\nIt's like Fifteen words wall\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody knew what was going on\n[noise] well ah\nAs you know Harry had to be first or something had to escape right here with us at ... he had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia and she was not stress I heard him so he had to be first it matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game\nAbout that so uh\nAnd he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy\nUm I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um career you know mogul yeah how do you survive he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nAnd it was rush cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome and all these\nDifferent ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was going to do he\nWas going to do it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know ... all I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nDidn't know that for a fact didn't comfort professor bats his wife\nBass was in top shape ... best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died and bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive and after he died\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so if you remember Nineteen twenty nine when message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way\nAnd then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money she was\nArrested in the stock market\nYes she loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like a girls on trees she just\nAnd I get Siri left her nice little sum\nYeah he left her a part of the uh they pay double a\nDamn nitty or whatever for his insurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money that\nRight ... probably that's close to a million dollars [noise] um so\nThey doubled that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched him mhm and so it was the insurance company that came up and said\nAh that can't happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court so she got a thousand so she was rolling in do know and then she they put it all in a market and she lost at all\nNow you have heard of the crash that killed Houdini yes what is the Kurdish\nKnow Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show was magic mhm the second part was the ... skates he would do an escape\nThat was where the water the Chinese water torture cell or the uh the can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual life and he would have have this confrontation with\nThem launching often self like confrontation right [noise]\nWell at some point in time he would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party he would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a\nA that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he'd go in and you'd find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent gallon that goes in the dark or something\nOn the I found it I got to you know and\nAnd probably string or something like that\nRight so uh and of course the the medium to adjust my ah where do you do that I didn't have nothing to do with that\nWell they honestly didn't because\nI I'm a magician and a magician always have what you call in out in the way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick\nYou might have two or three different methods on how it works and then something else he switched to the next one and you switch to the next one and and at work so you're assured of success\nAnd so in his magic that's built in in the states of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in there\nYou know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T vast would come out and kiss him and she'd have the appropriate tea in her mouth\nAnd just put it into his mouth\nExactly uh-huh into he always had an out he always had a way out well it was exactly the same thing for the spiritual spiritual us because he had an agent\nAnd she won't go into town and she would find some low hanging fruit you would find some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't find what they're doing and she couldn't catch them\nSo she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini you had a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems that somebody somewhere puts a curse on it\nRight so he did this with Marjorie id Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston um\nHold on for ... seconds a

R. dot com\n[noise]\n\nOkay well come back to go to college professor she lynching with us as we talk about the life of peer review Deanie we'll also talk about magic very shortly as well professor back to the curse you were talking about the Marjorie and Houdini and explain a little bit more about who Marjorie was\nOK I'm Marjory his real name in a mean a ... and she was a socialite in Boston she was married to a doctor\nAnd they had kind of a mysterious life she uh was set to be really really a ... lady uh all the pictures I see she looks pretty average but everybody who met her I thought she was just devastating beautiful I don't know why but they did\nUh and uh it had probably have something to do with the way that she did say on a minute when they called her Marjorie and she was the which of lined streets sometimes they called her the blonde which of Boston\nAnd complement and those they used to call somebody a which\nI think so I think [laughter]\nI think they uh they got a big kick out of it because I was a a lot of people during that time period during the spiritual is but\nI'm a lot of people are having families circles they were all kinds of people that were Catholics are Baptists or whatever on their on their Sunday afternoon or a Saturday they would all get together in the middle of the day and hold hands and somebody would go into a trance and they would try to contact their deceased\nRelative it was a common back in the twenty\nOkay but this this curse now\nRight so a Harry goes and he's going to check out I mean a ... and he's going to go to Boston and they line up about six fan says that he's going to attend now the Scientific American as a twenty five hundred dollar per se\nFor anybody that can prove that they are a real medium or anything normal\nAnd a kind of like the J. R. E. F. the James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here which they never had to give out right they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participant [laughter] I'm all they're all like you for that one\nYeah uh well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving them money whoever they want it interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar\nContest so they were coming out way ahead so anyway the ah\nThe Scientific American have the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to a Marjorie Chan says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em ... that's the agent that easily center ahead what he does he builds up box kind of looks like a sauna he built this box and he has um\nJames Collins build it for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head and our hands can stick out okay so she can't get at anything so who d'nese gotta make sure\nThat she can't produce any trickery so they are\nDoing and say on everything goes according to plan and uh they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box and if they push on the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now\nAh and in this particular incident free put it between Houdini slack\nSo there's no way anyone could get out well in the first chance the bell rings for the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box he's going to stop it right and they put ... and the second say on the bell ring so now he's baffled\nSo now he's got a picture and remember what we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to pick the marching ... Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her\nHow he is you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book he's going to put out three has to expose her\nSo she comes in uh everybody gets around the fans and of course Marjorie has a spirit guide and his name is Walter when it's Marjorie brother\nSo Walter she goes into a ... and Walter comes out and just start cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini\nAnd he says why do you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nConditional every interested in most instances fear and saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit watcher put a death curse because\nAnd the spirit Walter puts a death curse because inside the box is a ruler one of those rulers pulled up in three pieces\nAnd one of those all kinds of this and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini while and a James calling\nHow soon ... was the curse a professor and then who didn't he ended up dying\nWell the ... acre stem and some people say that he said you'll die in a year that that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nAnd could die at any moment\nYeah and it's really really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy\nRight that they have papa fried that he's going to die so later when Houdini gets sick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor\nCan feed them and\nHe doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something is happening and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur forward what happened to him was actually\nArthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or\nDid he all lip Houdini\nHe outlive all uh she lived until Seventy one oh wow okay Arthur poured lived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini a tries to frame up Marjory\nI'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he does it and you've got these\nPhotos of Marjory legs under the table mhm and then he had some drawings made her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes them drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing a\nLittle trickery by Houdini\nYes so Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nA expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with down injure and then he worked with crafting and he makes a statement of theirs up a bombshell in in the interview crafting\nAnd he gives this quote by Gibson it says when we're all magicians realize that Houdini was often emphasis on us as the medium he purported to expose wow\nThat's pretty heavy\nThat is heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em yeah James Collins in there and that uh the rose Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three parts show can\nYou imagine what Houdini would have done for sure if they had television in those days\nA boy you would have been you Michelle\nKyrie or brings up another a subject you know a ... on San says and you wonder why people do put a thing I'm fine with TV really [noise] well I was involved in a a\nHole in the dark and it's so much you won't see anything\nRight well we'll talk about that a little later because these Sanford is the one I'm Talking about happened in broad daylight\nWell really Arthur port fans who was about a new broad daylight when he had the Houdini fans [noise] um\nTake you an age quickly has been brought to you by pressing belly heating and cooling\nWere then talk of the quad cities eleven thirty and keeps you in a press he'd belly and on Ninety nine point nine F.

I'm just going to ask you if you question okay that's or did he have any apparatus that raises the elephants from underground you know you did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there\n[noise] yeah [noise] okay we'll do a little more homework yeah yeah there you go now now that\nComes up with the tricks I mean it was just Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trick\nAnd let's do this and we can make this and that how did they do this same what's called upon Copperfield to I assume we as people on staff like you are right\nExactly exactly um James Collins when the guy that Houdini had built an all important but Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the HIPAA Jerome they walk in Allison out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then the shrouded in or close to the or something and then the trick began I it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he probably the same queen that's there [laughter] in Europe but I don't think she was at their okay I I don't know for sure next I don't\nThink she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\nAnd let's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis Hi Ralph go ahead\nYes I'm here already taken away things uh\nI knew are here for a while and it was the last five years of his life got a letter for just before he died of seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found him\nA question for you is what we what irritated archer forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini this was in Nineteen twenty nine okay with a three part code or the cope with the middle section\nFirst word was Rosa dollar rows and then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe and then she had Dr worth in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his code I'd gotten through\nNow didn't he she later denied that later on or after she loses her friend\nLater on after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man called Edward fate comes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nHe fell in love again yeah so you didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she went in the same kind of way there is there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her [noise] we promise to her that ... can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars\nOkay go ahead what\nYear than they cheat deny that the the code was correct well the first time she never denies the code was correct uh she says that she was pool but she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after\nUm she they're given the messages\nShe having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she she said she was hesitant about uh money coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math\nDepression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and not breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh Arthur Ford was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing your pleasure for that than Edward think comes in leader promises or a million dollars\nAnd then they go on and about eight years later they make a movie called a a religious racket years\nYeah he made and what John a couple of movies at least to me\nWell Houdini made four or five Bobby\nYeah but they also I Hope they do they do well\nOr they did fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas he like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey heat with an actor and he always had like a really really good looking co star\nHis real name Eric Weiss\nYes he was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI kind of a sudden muffin guy he was only and everything kind of a smooth talker could really give a a ...\nCompliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of his tapes and all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nGifts and knocks Eric turned into Harry and then Houdini he got from who died on and he added and I called in Houdini\nAnd so to this day they call a merry Houdini but I don't think he ever a tortured name and he was born in Europe and I wasn't born here and he ... he\nWas born in Hungary yeah he was born in Hungary Budapest and he wasn't even actually a U.S citizen if you\nThink wasn't there a magician the Blackstone did he come after hearing\nA blacks almost after area\nOkay he was he was pretty good too wasn't he\nHe was great he was great or there was him and his son also there was a junior\nHas has a techno who's who's the artist who are David Blaine is humid you should do\nWell he's a very good magician he is a missed the fire or any began calling himself a missed the fire [noise] uh he kind of drop the magician fang\nOkay and so people are starting to go that way it's part of the mystery art [noise] you know\nWhen people go see a magician do they want the trick to fail or succeed what do you think\nWell I think they all want it to succeed I think you'd be a strange individual if you'd like to see the guy fall on his face\nAnd some people who want to see that\nYeah maybe maybe uh I don't uh\nI I Want I Want to see the the trek professor and then try to figure out what happened how we did it\nRight that's me when I when I
