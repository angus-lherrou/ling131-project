white people blacks and Hispanics they vote in a herd instincts Democrat and because not too many of them vote Republican and conservative we're heading for dire times\nAnd like hey hey let let let me are real quickly\nYou're right about the Democratic thing there's no way that that Puerto Rico's going to become a state now with the Republicans in charge 'em and and and they want to become a state now they didn't before because they didn't get the help help and Maria [noise]\nThey were you see if you go to Orlando I used to be in Tampa right near their Orlando is getting is are the ones getting these high call I'm telling ya in Puerto Rico here there's a shortage of doctors Dennis professionals everything because those are the people most moving so it may not be happening Rochester but you go to Orlando or Texas\nYou're going to see a different story most of the Puerto Ricans in the fifties and sixties moved up into the northeast but the they're mainly moving into Florida first and in places like Texas oh\nIt is it is a mixed bag but I agree with you a hundred percent there is this red blue war and it is serious and there is going to be a lot of tensions and civil unrest and if there's this much now imagine what it would be like if we had Fifteen Percent unemployment in the U. S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension and not polarity that's the one thing I can tell you 'cause I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight\nAnd they're the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans ... democratic big deal ... mood point\nWhile he will he saying that that you know the the rich people don't like that these are people who are going to vote blue and we got this blue red or so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about or tilting the boat all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to\nThose Puerto Ricans the Republicans and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate both courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do use in\nThe Democratic isn't that what our democracy zone\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory right yes my question Georgia and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe can thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidize the red states and the state that receives the most of Kentucky with an idiot McConnell was I'm a destroys me nuts and it's something like this for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast does an SOS the mid west\nFor um for your guest I've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying as as a column every week scaring the heck I'm up all of us with with what you're saying\nOoh closer to home I'm about four years from retirement if it were thirty five years almost forty years are entity which was nationwide but some through New York\nOur country was over funded in the late nineties it took a horrendous hit with this time the tech stocks and then in two thousand they almost ... we have a meeting with thousands of is about to retire right mall high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks that are into the\nCat and I don't trust any money on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will begin and I'm Frank rules about who should come down from heaven and come back but the thing is what do we ask our financial\nPeople who are running our pension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYou know real quick they they used to pop and not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments like treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more in but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThen they're in trouble the truth is as much as it's counterintuitive pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bonds\nA corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up a four point three percent we're telling our subscribers and this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stocked evidence but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down and interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rates are right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression triple a corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bond lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stock the worst place to be for a pension plan is to do what everybody's that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nWhy I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California\nWhat happens to your red economy when New York and California when the north east and the west coast succeed from the union would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Thomas in ... California Hey Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call sir Harry your research is really appreciate it um [noise] I mean you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depression and major recession as horror\nAnd you could argue that the world today than a third world war that's a proxy war\nYou know in places like Syria yeah I'm On the south China Sea et cetera and one horrible horrible rations cannot compromise\nTheir differences and look horrible boardrooms there was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so I don't think I mean a limited nuclear exchange ... turned the states and to a third world country\nAnd a day or two you know with a lecture magnetic both got cetera what is a probability of a shooting war\nYou know I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan\nI'm ... but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge in World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two and with the great depression and mental with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening like happen then this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries lose\nThat and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because nobody is picking up the challenges but one advantage we have it is there's there is no counter bailing power that can really take us on one on one\nSomebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that's kind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds Mitt Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power is that how you could have or one or two we're going to definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said in zero hour before this became obvious this is going to last two or three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but they're certainly going to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike Harry ... with us we're coming back from final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast the\nDaily Show up the right to your inbox for free with the newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\nOr or\nIn two thousand ten lines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love are blind or offer a bitter free guarantee meaning if you're blind don't fit for any reason oh remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd that ... has made it even easier checkout blanket no to a cellular shades that first and only shades installed without screwed or tools ... listeners take up to fifty percent off any harder just use the code coast at checkout that's blank stare dot com blind T.

culture Harry thank you again for the amazing information you're always give us\nA lot of the richest people George people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jay ... go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market it used to do with the Dutch and I happen to get in mid July or the you can and cannot be ... but the average company which happened to be pretty good timing\nBut the average company which happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually stumbled in in value on the bottom fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio\nBut my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly and feel the ... election this November because there are several states dinner looking you then have it on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that than now because of this nature of\nWhat you're talking about taking place\nWell you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit\nBut the the strongest sectors get hit the most 'cause they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in the history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop but yes I Do think singer in such a hot sector take your gains see what happens the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah it things crash that is a good sector to get back into this is a long term social political trend it's gonna go in that direction\nAlthough there may be some backlash and the downturn just because\nPeople get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good actor but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because I went in the great depression the entire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper\nUm utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more in a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations in that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nAgain in your case I might just see these elections pop and then\nGo the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know what you want more how do you know when the ball back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past corrections I mean everything is different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets\nEven a de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock as are the leading ones when that happened is Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed eighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so\nI'm looking for levels like that I think my range is Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe\nShort term bonds or in CDs and T bills and stop to preserve the money next step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then\nAnd and and the sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana in pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise] wait for the ... you may get\nTo buy into that a little earlier\nThan something like you know home builders\nNext one is going to do good to talk of the first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show you Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican you OK loose Democrat Democrat\nI mentioned that you not say earner or did I miss I understand you've made you said the south was ran during the civil war\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and helped get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party he had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so\nThe Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now\nIf you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor the Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans Hoover coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the demo they'd go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a boy in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are our long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican area here\nTo a democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are going to like that the rich people long but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart a son and my work Republicans are always going to be or Democrats or it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms and Boston inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's gonna be the east\nAnd that's another trend we can clearly show through cycle so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this factor that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue red I mean we can do all this stuff the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong comments think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty to Seventy percent right but never a hundred when I tell told people Twenty years ago baby boomers are going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down and his gears that was not a gas that science of when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\nBoard in Florida and the wild card line in born in by the way next next week we're doing a show on student loans\nOh wow

going to tell them to you\nI'm pro gun pro gun rights I'm fiscally conservative\nSo when I say that they both liberal the Democrats and the Republicans have taxed students to death\nWith college tuition and not done anything both parties are bad and voters in both parties don't want to be over tax tuition is a form of tax money go into an arm of the government both political of both the

said\nUh George you don't go to bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again in this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Manny right at the at that point it's lamb be back into my body\nI woke up where we Gerard I'm eleven years old I don't know what the heck happened to me yeah but I'm actually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the psyche grown section and I guess and bombed a book on national projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since I Believe in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just found myself voted on the ceiling looking down at my\nUm I just like you I just found myself voted on the ceiling letting down at my body in bed\nBy you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr Raul dependent field who was able to his mapping out the different areas of the ban and he if he had a kickoff stimulation on the right tempo car taxi is able to produce and not have body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in advance and that tells me that the that everybody's being world protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body experiences we had we were quite straightforward um they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around ... novel people can leave not just their\nTheir body but they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know what I'm such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go on and on and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and I was the second year medical student I drive in the last ... examined the night before the exam and I went to the examined next day the first question on the exam at the same as the first question in my dreams\nYou have the answer that you knew exactly\nSo I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people have been I think they're weird or the strange for there's something wrong with him or are they losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences\nI mentioned that the word paranormal for example the ... parent means beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on so parent norm I mean beside normal it doesn't mean abnormal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things and I was really what motivated me to write the\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr Shafiq curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with his\nShoes or her her into my aunt and she was she went to a Oxford University\nAnd she got her degree in psychiatry yet and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy and when that's all she did she wrote a couple of books when was called breakthrough the creativity\nOf but she was convinced totally convinced\nThat the ... the was the real deal and uh and again the psychiatrists seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know\nThat has really jumped into this\n[noise] I don't know I'd like to look for that book ... that sounds very interesting on\nBreaks through to creativity I'm\nDefinitely look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians about near death experiences for example even Alexander ... who have and you know and he's been there a surgeon\nAnd marry the meal she loved to have an impact she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in ... he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that I mean she you know she just the the the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre when she was in the bath tub in a radio filled in their home no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show\nYou that is terrible it was just don't know how does he got so interested in the last thing\nShe just always once and uh there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to do this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good well I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York where they were studying deemed to the the the ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd the receiver it's we're in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to the teeth and um the AG could measure what we call them sleep rapid eye movement and then once the ... gene state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to be the face and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to to let the the when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to till after the when they were under hypnosis so there are ways to augment fuzzy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr many majors with us his book the borders of normal\n... new renewable kudos am\nNow available I don't know I enjoyed for not only listen live on a new mission anywhere anytime\nGoes to goes to the U. N. dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\nUm that actually happened with my dad when he lives in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned all of this so and so you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWith dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm fed someone was coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got close to death these visitors became more frequent\nAnd these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise] so yeah I think those those deathbed visions are very common now one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone with a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who are at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not so unusual though isn't it\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying patients saw\n[noise] and that's interesting because\nYou know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brains they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut at the vision through shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of option to their brain and they weren't on medication so\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that\nAnd there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believe areas in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWhen Steve and Steve Jobs from apple computer died many asked you was quoted as saying\nWow wow right now what\nDo you think he should she was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives if they see a beautiful landscape beautiful vision you know\nI'm a bright white light you know a spiritual being you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love no these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs if experiencing\nYeah that could be that could be no skeptics of course say what the you mentioned that you\nKnow it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the mobile death how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he's head of of the the patients who died and more resuscitated Eighteen percent of the ... report in the near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to a lack of oxygen to the brain than they would've all habits because they all had a lack of oxygen that brain\nNot just as a small percentage [noise]\nSo you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that show that these experiences are in many different kinds of pizza and they'd be getting reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication\nWith his patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and who didn't have a shortage boxed into the brain had the same experiences that mobile to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise]\nUm people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical but it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked to my under deathbed visions that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain the\n[noise] well the other visitors aside from family members\nThey could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side um especially with children and there was a pediatrician Melvin Martha Stewart just dying children and he said the dying children didn't report\nDeceased relative because their parents and their relatives and friends are all still living\nBut they reported the angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the coffin\nDid anybody else you\nKnow so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them but in my own mind I saw those\nAngels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition to the next level of the next world\nAnd they were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what you make of it but that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nDid they see you I don't think so\nOkay I don't think they were there for me I think they were there for my father right\nSo they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... that's right [noise] now is the other thing is when you say in terms of his deathbed visions [noise]\nYou know um if they were produced by certain chemicals then why would the um visitors only ... the people who are deceased why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people they are the person who is dying to know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and one brother died and the other brother was near death so the the brother that was near death\nHad the vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accidents you didn't know that there was the end and the other cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family wanted to spare them the knowledge\nPre ... do the dreams you lose your thoughts on what\nThey are [noise] well there again I've had the cognitive dreams I mentioned one above the memory powerful above yeah exactly they're very powerful\nAnd the question is how do we know of a dream is a cognitive theme or if it's an anxiety dream because often you know when people are sleeping during their dreams they try to pro says things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about [noise]\nSo you know for example I talk about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered now we could say that that was the peak cognitive team that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\nMaybe I think you also had a dream where he was in ... the White House and he walked up to you so you're standing by chance and it was him in the casket\nI heard that too yeah yeah so that could have been a ... another famous person who reported a ... interview with Charles Dickens really I didn't hear that yeah 'cause when he would put out a new book he travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on\nSo one night before he was reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nI'm a group of people came up to them after his reading and a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with forwards she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive dreams tend to be very vivid\nI'm often when we wake up in the morning I Dream start to fade but pretty cognitive dream stay with us a movie member every detail\nSo the next day he went to give its reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as ... Napier\nSo so this stream was a pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or how to explain it but he he reported that he had that the cognitive dream [noise] so um that some people if he found ... the the person has written about\nYes commissions and the climate of beans and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's ... I was going to be or not and he said we should pay attention to dreams\nFirst of all the misery current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death I heard of a case recently where um this woman told her husband ... that she dreamt that she\nAnd her children died in a terrorist attack\nAnd this is a number of years ago there was um [noise] I don't know if you've heard of it there was a ... a disaster lay there was a terrorist attack aboard an air India fights and candidates Vancouver and this woman who is going from Vancouver to visit her family in India\nAnd she was going with my husband and children but then it has been decided he had some work to do in Vancouver he stayed be hiding behind and he was going to meet her there\nGiven as quickly as been brought to you by ... valley heating and cooling\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty and cake you in a press your belly Ninety nine point nine F.

sounds like what you're talking about two and then for my son died I had the same thing I had a vision of ... a dream for like two weeks and just didn't sleep an uneasy feeling\nAnd two cops coming to

close race\nBut I but I beat him but what we inherited a was a real mess the attorney general ... runs the state crime lab and when we took office a court right left us was if there was a rape or serious crime that occurred in Ohio the unknown DNA was taken to the state crime lab\nA it would have sat there if you can believe this for a hundred and twenty five days without him by overlooking that that's how far a backlog of the hat\nAnd a quarter I left that mess and so we fixed it uh we turned cases around now a twenty four hours if it's an emergency uh we're doing four times as much DNA as we did the day\nHe left office and up your average times about three weeks but we can turn this around very very quickly and the other thing that he didn't fare\nCordray and what we've done or he left um you know they were they were all rape kits sitting and police departments all over the state of Ohio law states that have this problem\nOr he didn't do anything about it when I became attorney general we we started hearing about that and we actually have tested every single one of them we went out to the police say bring it to us\nAh we want to get this evidence are tested and we've tested as I said close to fourteen thousand uh some of these are all court cases all cases uh some there's some Fifteen Years old and we've got hit or matches and thirty six percent so we've gone back\nYou

a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack on a rally of dissident Iranians in Paris this summer\nWe've seen transfer example now impose sanctions against Iran because of this

we're putting maximum pressure on the Iranian regime and just to be clear we are having a very significant effect\nYou can hear the European governments talked about staying in the deal European corporations and I mean the biggest one the biggest oil companies the biggest manufacturing firms are getting out of Iran are Iranian oil exports are plummeting their currency has gone through the floor unrest is spreading across the country\nEven countries like China or reducing their imports of oil from Iran because they don't want to tangle with the United states\nUh this is something that we shouldn't be concerned about because Iran remains what it has been since Nineteen Seventy nine it's seeing the world is leading state sponsor of care\nAt a press has its own citizens and it continues to pursue programs of weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological this is a dangerous stayed in the region and dangerous state worldwide\nIn your mind or the response of this president into any Iranian ... on the United states territory or against American ships or flagship\nNow I think he's been very clear on this not because we want hostilities with Iran but the opposite we want to be very clear about what our redlines are and I think the president's done that over and over again\nBut speaking of red lines a Chinese shift came with a hundred and thirty five feet of an American warship these are American sailors if we're threatened while our sailors fire on Chinese ships\nLook at the rules of engagement for US Navy vessels worldwide but particularly and potentially

say China is one of the new bills coming due that Obama ignored or mishandled badly pressures now and President Trump he's responded in a way\nThat has the Chinese confused they'd never seen an

at the G ... meeting in Argentina next month\nThe Asian paying willing to come to talk turkey on some of these issues are but the president feels very strongly that China's taken advantage of the

abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating the international norms we expected them to comply with they've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic
