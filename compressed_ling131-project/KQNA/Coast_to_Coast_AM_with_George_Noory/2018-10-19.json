dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think it got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nFor them to you can dream wide awake the world around she will speak the language of science and symbols and things but as you could pay attention and sometimes you get more alert to the pop ups the pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work\nThat that helps to turn on the dream club in the night as well\nAs some incredible wage to dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you have had some stories are directly related to that [laughter]\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again and there's a hilarious story a mysterious realities about a woman doctor for England who's complaining of the breakfast table\nHow Robert why do I keep having the same thing dream when I got to do my medical exams Thirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you have it really is the same ... very close to the same dream it's probably because\nYou have dreamed producers who are making a tree movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation in trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I Am out of the stories\nI I picture I sort of dream production movie company that is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep up\nMight be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same but\nJust not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you feel this but there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe it very strange women who sat down next to me and a plain old reality and mentored me at a certain point that a dead house than to the ... he was a ... musician he'd been shot in the face and a diner in Seattle all\nThose nice creepy story and he says to her and her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies so people are that they'll see in the dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects\nThe fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might be you that dream I if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you've become conscious it might be the um the shadow or hidden aspect of yourself\nMaybe if you're a high a self may be a site there why is slightly higher self\nIs the director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to is not hostile to you\nI just probably being run by someone with a side it why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about Joe current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock us awake into doing some course correction is\nInvade dramatize and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are parcel Robert in the eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think but here's here's where our our current understanding of dreaming and currents his ex uh meet up I mean the current under staffed by kinda understanding I mean the really ready to revive postal quite H. and understanding about dreams that dream is traveling for example\nUh you can tell the science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're in a field of information quantum field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to have this information and do something with it and ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discover the ... way into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information might getting we can bring three more and more I mean you could set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this they simply practical you can do dream in basements being juice at an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest you in probably something will come through if you don't think you got anything you'd wake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to lose a dream on that subject as well because you've got some rest nearby did take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history a lot of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of Stuart narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything and the history of credit breakthroughs in science and technology in the aughts\nEven in business and economics as well so when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is that can take you anywhere you will actually collect it really can can take us to the ... hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory pause it\nIt can take us into the off the lights the UCs the hand off the job opportunities some living environment a like\nA beyond death so you can talk to that and says to the law but loved ones and ... and others so you know this is the ... the other venture killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious neck in pretty much\nWhat about the ability to time travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know do not do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on a practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away some of this that in power out every day life and one of the things I Know from my own life and I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable I mean this is very important dreams shows\nOpportunities and challenges lie ahead there with us as the things we don't yet know about they can save your life they can save your job they could say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today\nIf I did not know for certain show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates was death fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that ... what was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file on the other side of a blind\nSpot for example so that's one direction for time travel but time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact\nTo understand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we step into a different place and in between place from which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times we leading a power live this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not that other parallel life\nAnd I got a very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost that that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations that people in ... places to the part of your multi dimensional family I'm a bit of an agnostic about reincarnation but I firmly believe based on my experience\nThat we are connected to dramas being lived in other places in times of the front of a sudden point of view it's all going on now I wouldn't be doing what I and I'm now doing or not and found myself connected with an Anglo Irishman who came to the American colonies\nIn the Seventeen hundreds of ...

you written Robert\nThis is the ... the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\nOut on a show of that\nThat's still pretty prolific do good for you good for you and then they're all fascinating works\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that you can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely does lifted some really interesting areas for example in terms of the health\nMay well things going on in dreams of that that body talk as well as sold to get out of the woods and dreams we see what's going on inside the body at all in fashion doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example that says front and center the idea is that a dream like it was an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show symptoms that are developing might that maple is to avoid those symptoms from the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams will chose the things that help us to get wild and to stay relevant ended with acting up on those dream to try and bring their energy true you mentioned connecting with other people will you know to let the the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or a load of being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people are related to each other either by Lovell by family well by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive creamy which we find ourselves sharing adventures\nWith friends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream as a matter of fact you discover if you wake up your dreams remember more than a look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's being cold again super normal capacity the abnormal\nSupernatural but beyond the normal I'm Talking about things like pre cognition until after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen right but see things in the distance but I go to connect with other people\nAnd these are natural powers and abilities that along to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that fewer\nGrowing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solution for things for him to deliver them if you can find a solution to a problem to oatmeal I put the question to your dreams and see what come\nAnd I would add to that that you can do this every day life as well because dreaming for the it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes is what happens when you open your eyes wider so proud of this part of part of the ... is\nThat the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind\nAnd suddenly the will deliver that incident or striking that gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is put\nYour question to the world go down the street are going to the talk of going your morning commute but that question in your mind and received the first unusual unexpected thing to enter your field of perception of the message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing\nHow specifically the world will speak to you and bring a dream my message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd ah what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed\nOr he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him\nA mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I'd like to tape and I've got something for you to come on down it works does\nThroughout your offend the Europe be ... and your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy decode them mental to Laker feedback in his day when people said telegrams\nHe'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with\nNot mailing it he just ... attention on that I noticed was followed them he said that actually almost didn't celebrate that was a response so you practice figure game that isn't a joke and it works I mean we know that are already facing\nThey're already thoughts and feelings already action and\nAre already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about now that is you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached I mean you are reaching out um but nine way to do something good we wouldn't want to be open to be reached by just anybody with a with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending a mental sending medical ... the as what Mark Twain photos\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have the inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then you know for some reason they pick it up yeah\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments of microbes by which one of those degrees the bell sending him it just might be a painting it might be a sculpture it's not announced image to the group and people have the gas in the morning after the night of sending you walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMy to being and it's interesting how that works and some people a very good at picking up and some people a better send to another but but this is just a focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where where in into weaving field of interaction and it goes on in ... all the time\nYou've talked about synchronous you explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this make dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the ... or re understanding a consensual hallucinations suddenly you get into a deeper space we have encounters with people who live in the deepest space including that of powder than our ancestors\nTruth synchronous today we often healed but also the intelligence that live on the other side of those cook in the walls of Audrey understanding\nCome pushing old poking or ... to bring us a way to give us a message of some kind\nOf a thing about ... meaningful convinced that you gave us the would sit in front of the cause is cut off without trouble and talking about going since I gave us a different would incident last year we often feel there's a hidden happy if you're getting a wait and cannot handshake or pushback\nFrom something beyond our can something we cannot see so although at the phenomena this cold isn't a causal phenomena them and said than so there's no obvious Patton of cause and effect we often feel there is causation that play you might even feel that very large forces are in play\nForces the forces of human called the archetype so that people\nMight have called the ... the guard until the ancestors are in play\nSo I Am a great proponent and then actually conditions and shapes every day of my life but paying attention to the unusual unexpected things that are going on in the world around you and seeing what the ... looks like not just one message you might get one message you needed at say stop or something like that\nBut you might notice that there's a path enough connection as you go through the day is sit in the even comes up again and again a sudden symbol comes up again and again and you notice when that is happening with a recurring dream hey slowdown pay attention or what you need to do with this sort of you to those telling you that you need to act of\nRobert since you've been doing this have we got any answer on why it works or how it works because we do agree that it does work well now yes\nWell it is the law of attraction has been oversimplified of mistakes that by that by the new age but the laws attraction is always in play the law of attraction means we attract over pill events or encounters according to the energy and the ideas we carry\nIt works at all levels of our lives is never a secret it's gone on for very long time\nSo what you notice in the way of sit in front of city and maybe what you remember from your dream has a great deal to do with what you're open to much are available for\nA you know in in everyday life if you're carrying a negative attitude about the will of the world's going to give you lots of reasons to sustain that view that you are carrying if you can manage

had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nBut the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a literal meaning but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening coming across the call unstoppable and seeing this maybe this EMT\nOkay maybe that's symbolic of some things that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional for some of the emotional pools or something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me the pairing me forward emotional situation which are not all it's all situation which I Need to be ready for I don't know but that comes to my mind\nThe upside down cell phone you know I just want to holding that image I realize that might be something

that I Am about treats I probably would I rather liked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years that he has since the dream\nI didn't

that tree\nClimber wire dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't it just so obvious\nWell I think that actually the dream sauces the dream sauces and many sources of ... and try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily not enough to follow all of this\nUh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the ...\nTake a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quick to determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the get\nWhen you learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream I I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you are playing do something about living a whole life\nAnd play implicitly in your dreams I mean once they understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes to talk time we can get into ... whatever we bring back from the dreams is only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond our first memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nWhat is more prevalent looser dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nA lot of people are dying seem yet to understand how to come to ... the idea of elusive dream it's become very popular ... movie inception and on the idea is talented you couldn't make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe the sad loose of dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it for themselves but many trying memorized ways of wake you up thanks to creamy inside the dream because your hands and see if you can stick a thing

population of the moment at the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having ...\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having ... trees but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people look it up to it I think it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not\nScout ahead of us felt some aspect of consciousness checks up what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it\nSo regular dreams what a regular dream some people I mean the dream span a whole spectrum there are big dreams are little dreams that little room sort of rather routine protests they could walk on the day before commentary on how you fit of just self and how fast you ate the

I Love your right being statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the cream of the night into the dream of the day I think we do step from one stage unconditional treat me into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream in reality you might be more plastic and malleable can we make allowance for we talked a bit earlier about how your your your attention the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape you'll reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel all shapes shifting et cetera is of course is is has beat on to debate among scholars and scientists and and their traditions of it in different medical needs just\nAs you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility either ... kind of primal Sherman or with the technology of the future I don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from um time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of it sometimes\nI don't know where the shapes shifting in the way the Germans connect with the animal spirits central is physically possible for those people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible and the earliest stage of human evolution and the human animal divide was not as absolute as this today\nBut anyway leaving aside those are areas which about when they need to think about and the stuff of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from a dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of dreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas\nDivide step from what subjects up from one room into another from one landscape all from one field into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back it as the body in the bed\nI get it out of bed I go out in the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out into the street or out in the day to change things for the better make healthy choices and to participate in the construction of reality that we sometimes ...\nDreams is just so powerful Robert aren't they\nMight gosh they're they are I'm dreaming of the way that\nWe wake up this is one of my postal mantras when I used to be my bumper sticker on my car when I had bumper stickers on my car I made I made one but said wake up and dream because to me dreaming is not fundamentally about what happens during sleep I valued sleep creams highly including the ones you don't ... do not want that night show you exactly what you need to know\nNot we can dream in other ways\nTo wake up to the deeper reality and I was always waking sometimes without dreams where like sleep will cause doing with other people tell us to do trying to fit in with their expectations trying to to fit in with our schedules and forgetting that allowed this to all of this we're\nGonna come back Robert in ... minutes and just take some final calls with you next\nSeven Daniel\nFall flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deal lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin will look laminate flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nRefinished hardwood and bamboo starting in Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nStill nothing like homemade ...

linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com moss dreams dot com\nAnd for people who want more information about the online courses they're still available on your website Robert\nStay up\nThat one is called what the shift network tell me about\nThat the network\nThey had a lot of interesting programs where I've been doing a long long coat confident dreaming where we marry some the method than ideas of shut many dreaming to the insides of quantum physics I did and from time to time at different levels and we create an international community of active for humans who have wonderful\nWhat has been for you the most\nOverwhelming aspect of dreams you dream interpretations for you\nI mean the impacts important thing for me to do it is the story that come from it I mean I'm a story when I meet a stranger on the plane vows what do I do I say I'm a storyteller and it gives me great pleasure to help other people find bigger and brave of stories might he might have been living and to apply those stories and bring them into the world and\nDreams our thoughts of story this is a very ancient form the creation of dreams if get up the western desert in a straight\nA in it aboriginal people who still love the old way like some of the crooked job will sit around a fire but are they gonna believe that the tea and they're sharing stories no TV that the stories of other entertainment and the first comment on a certain kind of Greene story might be\nA good story that on those stories sweet tea\nI let let me just go a little bit with this I think sometimes in life we're trapped in the old tired the snow histories we need a way of finding a way for would entering a larger more powerful story which can be a source of healing and courage\nAnd determination in light of dreams deliver stories so I think the me all of the time I've been dreaming I'm looking for this story power of previous stories I could write them could tell stories that helped to tell my life in a lot to frame than the ... little everyday mind\nMight appreciate and I really love it really gives me great pleasure to watch other people finding an harvesting the stories of the dreams of giving them\nAnd then your work conversation with a name and the Luna yes a lot of people are a little scared about that and what's what's going on\nWell they might be I mean it it it it might be scary to think that there are realms of spiritual being beyond our human plane\nUh who are operating in terror of tree that might initially be a little daunting to humans it's an ancient understanding the astro plane of the moon and I'm Talking about the physical ... known to the Astros realm of Luna\nIs a place of much traffic with solar spirits coming into the body in this world transit with almost third leaving the world after death might also spent some time but if it's on the right track and it's going up with Rob Dunn for their beings of this plane\nSo I gave voice to being of the asteroid realm of looting and he's not to be cool to be money is not even his day mountain that the ancient Greek too which is neither good no doubt in itself it means he's a third she'll be\nWho lives on a different plane of reality and we hear in his voice\nWhat might be going on in your life on line in terms of what happens people are the what happens after death which might be but there are a transition zone for the veterans of course called bothers states\nWhich have a certain geography which is that would seem to find out about the geography involving for example you stole realm of the mood so I gave voice to a very interesting culture should a creature of vis a vis realm and read it and judge yourself\nExcellent listening to calls let us go to Joe in Long Island New York Hi Joe go ahead\nYeah Hi Rob a couple of things uh my first question would be a notice saying something trains\nThat seemed to have a scene with moving parts square that this moving parts\nAnd I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio as are trying to find his way out of the ship is always moving parts and they still has that theme of they still wants to stay with us girlfriend in the movie uh yeah you know we still have felt about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just talking now with that kind of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on jumping and I noticed\nA couple of times I block shots at work near the top of the back yard so I had the big shopping high energy good jumping ... yeah\nWas correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could jump higher you know is basically concerned with scarring a lot of points or getting a lot of fast\nSo I Can't having scream about shopping and I never really thought about shopping when I played a lot of basketball so\nThe idea of a dream bringing up the aspects of something that a lot yet didn't focus on while you were doing it and why would a train to soak a maybe like a singer\nAnd why would a dream to soak it maybe like a singer you know always son to a certain type of song law or in Iraq and its springing up another type of a second you had a very interesting\nI mean I'm thinking if I if I'm a former player I I'm not doing at this stage in my life but here I Am jumping higher I used to do in in my dream\nMaybe the dream is preparing me for jumped jumped in life of a different kind where is the next tide jump I might want to take in my life it might be a new form of activity might be a new form of understanding where am I going to be able to slam dunk in another field of activity in life so that we might be making an analogy\nBetween my ... my great prowess on on the basketball court\nWith these jumps on the jumps lies ahead but the the moving parts and the Titanic analogy is interesting is not allowed to go on but if I if the moving parts take me think of that you know emotional scene from the movies\nI might wonder again where in my life my being prepared by history to move on in some sense and I can't think about the Titanic without recalling up there was a great British researcher psychic phenomena the paranormal W T\nStand here the famous journalist in his day went down on the Titanic Twenty years before he went down on the Titanic\nHe wrote a story about the record the supposedly unsinkable line a cold the majestic you know even with the captain of the boat in his story was the name of the captain on the Titanic\nSo they're from the history of the Titanic we have an account along rage pre cognition as embodied the story rather than simply a dream of pulled I must have the stand up to death dictator there was a dictator or a marketable account of life on the other side of death called the blue Ireland so the Titanic association\nSets all sorts of parts moving in my mind that take it for that\nYou know how do you explain things like Leonardo da Vinci came up with I mean he was a genius ... almost like a time travel or how would you do that in a dream state you think\nYou you feel that in relation to sit and kind of mind Jews often said that you can't explain test for the original Tesla except as a time travel you do feel that great minds are able to draw upon intelligence and understanding from more than ... reality they already know sends a
