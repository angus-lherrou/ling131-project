experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit to based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to shut down I think it as an interest just a sec says something to do with it\nEvery body refocusing\nTheir attention on their um let's just say their biological urges so mhm but children are I I have an entire chapter devoted to this is my second book about children's out of body experience\nI have received thousands of letters from over the decades from parents who share their experiences with about their children unfortunately\nI'm In our society sometimes either misinterpreted and you know they they end up taking their child to a psychologist or psychiatrist because it's out of there\nOut of the norm for our family to deal with huh so they end up giving the child Ritalin or something else to calm them down or whatever or it's unfortunate because there it's just natural you know ... or ... you know what's funny is that night do over Ninety percent of Americans\nBelieve that there is an afterlife\nThat we are non physical spiritual being in other words\nIf we are as most people believe\nThem why would we be locked into a biological machine for our entire life Web when that's not what we are\nWe we have a natural ability to explore beyond their physical limits the Buddhist said no no it's forever that's why they train young Buddhist\nBoys at a very young age to begin their training and meditation because there are more open to having profound\nSpiritual or a multi dimensional experiences when they're young\nRight right and then you we don't we don't receive dot com we've been trained to be a very materialistic from birth so that has a tendency we have to overcome that conditioning that most of us have reached a\nRight to not mostly focused on the external when we're young somewhere between two to five years older than the voting them than the average number an antibody reported\nYes they're very young and they continue up to puberty and a lot of them were amazed that I have twin boys and my boys both of them would have just profound experiences you know it was it was amazing to me what they would do at night\nThat's incredible I had one on now you say it's common in England and counter other in your\nExperience it can you go back and read the team had a nightmare and you wouldn't go back and you went to close the and create a new ending to it and her dream technique\nOh absolutely can you do that\nYou can run nightmare is a ... is a reflection of your fear\nAnd during and it's a matter of fact that's a technique I teach um that we have the ability to confront and let's just say dissolve our fears during an out of body experience in a very elegant manner you send loved to the fear during the out of body experience\nUm in other words you don't run from it you can from it and you send loved to it and dissolve that fear and you do it fully conscious not just in a dream but imagine it works in a dream to but imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully\nAbsolutely conscious\nAnd you do the same technique where you are literally dissipating dissolving\nFears are blocks that's the great block for self knowledge is fear right it's it's a great block that all of us confront a one way or another it's\nIt's invisible barks at everybody creates around themselves and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us an ability to\nConfront and dissipate and dissolve those fears that end up uh that just said eliminating our our ability to express ourselves fully in this life\nAlthough the eighty six percent can be found and you know here no fear hearing out of money they had a very useful thing\nYes according to this survey Haiti\nThat's very high\nIt yes it was it was pretty high remember that a lot of people responding to me also were not um they were open to the experience to some degree I have to acknowledge that that's a good point\nAh they were not let's say indoctrinated with this how far and damnation ... I'm a belief system that of course is nothing but fear\nHere is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population\nA and it still used today actively unfortunately to control um ... you know society or we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I say we have an opportunity to realize what we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal and it sounds a little grandiose you know that you know my\nLittle grandiose for him you know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not from I'm weak pathetic\nBeing not needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be ... that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you\nAnd your level of consciousness and forget about the tiny problem in life that\nYou feel are so large because our brains make them that way but truly they are insignificant when you compare and two how vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond our body yeah yeah\nAnd it was what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collective way otherwise you have your own profound experience\nYou're you're you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around your cars you know better you just look at it like it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance a political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff 'cause you realize it's a temporary drama and and you understand there was a bigger game at foot here you\nKnow the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer on of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his era coal news that we\nHave you ever did kill it and you realize it's you know there's so much of a court and stuff that we needed to know about ourselves\nThe greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self ... that's the core issue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it's suddenly awoke one day and\nI knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'll be no wars or be no I Know a lot of that would occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just them being on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly all be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\nDo we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we know how we're going to take another quick break

loss in general\nCoalition a little bit of both either long term memory and of the uh out about it it's just so\nNot\nInterfering with your like everyday memory of meaning to recall certain things that you use all the time so to speak like we're in stuff like that and driving things like that\nOh I Would definitely not or I can speak for myself partially my memory is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years or so I I\nWell like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and um they choose when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body technique that doesn't disturb the brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I've not seen any correlation for them to um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that live out of body ...\nI absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experience is a I have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert Rohde did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say\nSo if anything I think there is the opposite I think you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever seen any sense to me and out of body Sunni\nConsumed them than I can relate to the local ... myself out so to speak you

discovering yourself to Bonnie tunnel and I do like the fact that it doesn't even she is with the TV I any type of trauma\nOr a brain injury and went to avoid doing they are not scientists now know\nAh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do\nA for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese are an element of near death but the two were actually\nEven obese are part of the near death experience there also independent of that so it's important distinction to make\nIt

the\nGhost of surely it's actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom with the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so\nPrecious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it\nWill soon started telling him what to do\nLike oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd be like that\nPhillies sue [laughter] you know innocent but then I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old is your nephew advertising at this time next and\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying\nAnd he was covered in scratch marks\nAnd he was bleeding okay he was bleeding and it looks like he's been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had to cut the ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh dear you said stew\nI'm Sorry he kept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry let's do\nWell it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died\nNow the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore\nAnd then how when did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you just even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ... we had to I we had no choice right you had no choice oh where did you do that oh we had no choice and then\nIf it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew\nIt was fun it was like oh that silly stew\nHe stole something again you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway and it was just kind of ... and the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but Tom because see remember it was haunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or menus I'm just\nGoing to say that what what we ended up finding out was that it was it a portal it is it's the stream leap strongly haunted still\nAnd you are still living there\nNo milk no after five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left\nThe day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had ... on every level and we took the doorbell rang out and took the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went up it it felt like they were driving it's crazy\nLike we're driving you out would happen celebrating\nWhat came of that place what would happen to him\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house by USA Today and the Huffington Post\nWho would buy something like that\nAh it actually you know what about ... about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the houses happy again so I Am really\nI Would take a lot of work but they have done so much work than men with ... experts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain you know that really works\nIt apparently it worked because it's it's it's free [laughter] fascinating\nAbout a hundred years yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I wanted to know why the house was still haunted and I don't get into that right\nNow I did find out that there was a reason there always is any time something tragic all horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother\nUm their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old and so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son\nInteresting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to you know he\nHad an analytical mind do want to become a doctor can answer that can be\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he does is friends do ya that my mom should go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nSo it has to be ... to do\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling and now you still live in managing springs right Joes little the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one and this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah\nOh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies and um so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with managed to springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of managing springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have in my house is shaking my hand and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in the sacred places the trees actually grow kinda sideways\nAnd it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies\nUm Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managed to springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of him type crystal and their brain\nAnd it ... the he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies that the Brits were cutting confused because they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and\nEnd with kamikaze pilots\nTo being really is a very special place that is\nNew and we will find out more about managed to Springs Colorado and we come back with my guest Tiffany waters I Am listening to coast to coast\n\nDown\n\n[noise]\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pack between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um native is actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that make sense to me [laughter]\nYeah it does yeah do you know you live there I Do and you like it\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago with September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this for you to body\nIt was awful he's was suicide um come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a\nHigh incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um Ross often\nBut they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so are there are so many um artist dancers singer musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't\n... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved\nHere [laughter] oh and I see it happening to other people when I have one of them my a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help him out he was gone through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job\nHe was only here for a week and he you know the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can feel it I can feel that I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful though he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad how do I\nSuggest people process and energy wherever they live it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call us at [laughter]\nBecause you have to think about this why is it does appear why aren't they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nThey're going to do business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and [noise] um what do\nYou see that you would have to have a lot of anger to these it to be tethered here um\nIf you are a full life and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and towards the light um\nYou know you got a good point there to these beings want to see each other here to ... to disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're but they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go to bed and breakfast is haunted but only by a friendly spirit I'm like give me a great huh\nThere is no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they stayed that's a good point\nIt's trawling it's troubling and and when you know if this okay it it can it\nCan lead you down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean\nI don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows are on television\nAnd I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I don't believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her cross over by writing this last book and I have that that is a matter of fact\nHas that been forgotten meals in Colorado is\nBoth legends allure of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and the very first story is true I Swear to God Knows about it [laughter] pardon challenge about it okay about it they'd actually\nBegins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book\nThe old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter] anyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted [noise]\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was a little kid so some time to just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I have written for books on got goes legends the lord of the Rocky Mountains analyst quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels\nAnd I ... out of the blue dot a telephone call from the Colorado alarm company about\nAn intrusion signal\nOn Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is\nOnly a historian would know where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the\nThis place you know in the mountains and I'm like well they called me I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I wouldn't know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really we're not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why are you calling me is your check number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a myth that answers the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house and I said I got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with the theatre [laughter]\nI call the police department and I said you know your alarm going off at the theater and they go yeah yeah we're on our way [laughter] really next morning I called the mayor of ... a discount on what's happening I call the mayor I called the theater\nI told everybody I couldn't nobody could give me an answer\nNow did you still have that voice on yet\nViolate everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a psychic she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and and I said what the devil is going on with this and she listens to the tapes and you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater\nAnd a lot more in common that was just mind blowing and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes\nBecause she is very sad that she has been deemed when all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story and she wants you to correct it for her\n[laughter] you're kidding me and I said she goes no no I'm not saying you so\nI called I called the um\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ... I think I'm Crazy relation to this message and she calls me back and she goes I Want you to come up here by himself all alone much but the enough close in the winter okay and I said well it's no than her and she goes\nI don't care come on up so I get there\nAnd she lets me inside and she said if I tell you this [laughter] you know my neck is at stake and that's why I'm not telling you the theaters name them\nAnd I said yes I Do understand that and she goes I cannot say that this theater is haunted because I lose my job and I love my job but yes\nStephanie this theater is really haunted and I

quite a lot of money to have this building completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this is about this and that was like three million dollars right there [noise]\nBut anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building and I actually read\nThe article in the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five crows flew up into the air\nAnd not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you if you want to look it up it's easy to do looking at an omen I don't know but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nNow right [laughter] if you like them and to me maybe you shouldn't do it again yeah me not to the concept I mean there are\nCertain things to be said for these history tours and things that are being done in these secret lands mhm or our channels being built and so forth where's the this fine line there to honor and respect the lure of that particular way\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that the to the land that be and I give\nThere is a legend about manatees springs that you're not allowed to leave annoys you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice you Martin summoned to this town and I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and\nI always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs hallways the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of gas and stuff like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting who let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost or in your house or\nSomething that might be visiting you would would you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want this to transition when it moves on already\nYeah see I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings\nI think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe there certainly are it's that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not a ghost [laughter] um\nOther stay right up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move [laughter]\nUsually owns a particular person I didn't\nSee I earlier in the conversation I did say the my house has haunted that I live in now and that I Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the veil is so thin this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased\nI Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs\nHurt it they were howling like is going on I think that's a residual it's like a burp in time you know quantum physicists and explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like ... toast you can still smell the burnt toes [laughter]\nHealth you can still smell the pills [laughter] it's gone yeah I\nLive in time makes more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard\nDid not have a consciousness\nWe mean by that mean that was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense to have a conscious it's yeah it's just music that I heard like\nCame through a sometimes believe it or not I can hear the train that used to run behind my house and Senate ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear it so I don't know if other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could add up much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say it delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children especially that's why I Love like when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to back to where people feel that they're afraid of goats you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should move\nOn it and move on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry just noted eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that you know would you suggest or how would you cheat someone to us is this going to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works but would you ask\nI tell it or you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I notice is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind of person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something you know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah um when you ask this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those tiny is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we've all been fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it opens\nUp a whole new world or possibility and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child\nMy parents told me that it was because they drop me on the head when I was a baby imagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] people have had it happen\nDidn't do the Aztec I Would say yeah but now ... wish to you started this wonderful convention this paranoia ... travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\nWell um we call it a moot movable fees like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historian\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of any of those were here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\nThere is such a germ yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book\nThese so when you do the tours you have a group to come with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my towards um if you look at my website manage elections that time you will see that there is very little information on there after Seventeen years there's a reason for that\nI don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on after the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight so the tourists do change night by night and you'd ever know spirit has got to come out and play quite interesting [laughter]\nOh yeah does it do say with specific date and time and all that you think are not as validating\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay there are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I call those kind of as much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I'll catch a darn thing\nAnd that's how those tiny as you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes you'll it'll be hot and you'll catch a bunch it goes\nLike this All right we're going to take a quick break and they were going to come back with listeners phone calls and he goes to experiences or questions you have to step in the water

to highlight and focus on some areas of the country that you need to be aware of if you listen to me and some of these states that CNN lists you gotta pay close attention CNN is predicting that the house is going to go to the Democrats the Republicans are going to lose control of the house\nTo the Democrats but Republicans are going to not only keep control of the Senate would gain a seat or to be in the U.S Senate here's what he said well here's what she had him as saying\nA about where Democrats are they say poised to when they say they're forecasting when a number of seats in the northeast Pennsylvania is expected to be a bonanza\nFor Democrats so listen carefully if you listen to me in in the state of Pennsylvania she says the fifth sixth seventh and seventeenth districts\nAre all for cash to flip to the Democrats my five percentage points or more not ... not not a lot so they're but they're giving the flip the coin to the Democrats in Pennsylvania's fifth sixth seventh and seventeenth districts you listen to me in those areas please\nPay attention go vote they say the Democrats also have a shot to pick up numerous house seats\nIn the Midwest in Iowa Democrat ... aiming Finkenauer is predicted to when I was\nFirst district Democrats are favored to win Kansas is second and third districts in the south they said Democrats have a lot of opportunities there within two points\nA long time Republican incumbents in Texas is seventh\nAnd thirty second districts they're slightly ahead or tied in Kentucky's sixth district and Florida is twenty seventh district and then she says in the west Democrats are in good shape I Love how don't you know CNN crows\nAbout Democrats winning there is no bias overt CNN in the west do they say Democrats are in good shape in California alone they are up even if just barely\nAnd attempt is three twenty fifth district thirty ninth district\nForty fifth and forty nights Democrats probably won't won't win every single one of those\nBut it is possible there maybe some surprises two house races can break late the district pulling for them isn't always reliable and then they go on to the Senate map and they say unlike the house only thirty five but the one hundred Senate seats are up for election Democrats\nHave limited ground to pick up the net to they need for control chances are they will\nNot well\nA CNN
