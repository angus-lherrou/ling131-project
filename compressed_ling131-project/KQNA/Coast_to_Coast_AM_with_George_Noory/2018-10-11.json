was completely out of my realm so I didn't believe it I like to be honest George I thought it was a ... effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things\nAnd I've had people where their their arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke\nOr somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal\nSomebody with school Leo says who went completely out of pain\nAnd then you know a month or so were daughter wrote me just say that her back straight and so much they had to change the rearview mirror for car shoot stories like this over and over again and the same thing going on with some of the Sanders too and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo me are told me about the show how how powerful washing the beach and then what was happening to them\nWill their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of it George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't know this we don't know how to use it and we don't realize it amplifies in a group [noise] let me tell you about the story of Wes\nI mean when when when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just as kind of just as a test this is laugh mass on him last last fall and um I ... I wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the\nInitial group um because he suffered from terrible depression but there was a woman there with stage ... cancer Linda and so we we decided to go with her but Wes had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got\nA he got called in and he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they'd done away with draft deferments for college um college students and we had to go in the last horrible chaotic years with the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed\nAnd that continued in his life he even even lost the love of his life too fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he he got to meeting me he had gone to a point of feeling like what's the use\nAnd he was living in a senior facility you know barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed\nSo he does his intention for Linda [noise] and then that ... next day he told me he woke up and everything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been\nHe drank a cup of herbal tea and it knocked his socks off he says um but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college any net is Nineteen year old self\nAnd in the Nineteen year Old West\nCommunicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time and that experience to him was soon life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is power walking Ninety minutes he's lifting weights\nHe's running groups who is at his church is writing is trying to write again\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a senator\nUm and this is a story I hear over and over again we're that active being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows under need to have any special abilities\nWell here's the really interesting thing that you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nWorld and we say you were the skeptic 'em all skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I\nI started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this manifestation law of attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know are we talking about\nThe shifting of quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer hair so um that's what I set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had a life university is the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power of eight to let their nearest science department look at this\nSo we set up a group of students and we put a age he kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the groups and what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes\nThey would have this completely different brainwave signature it would turn off all the part of the power vague group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity\nSo these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one and when we compared these signatures wouldn't the nearest scientists who work at the doctors said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks and ecstatic prayer they had an identical brainwave signature\nBut the only difference was I had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk horror sci fi master sure my guys were total novices there were students who never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me to do\nWhen we're going to break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nAnd the power of each and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable when Mick Jagger it's website linked up for you to go see 'em a dot com somewhere other books the blonde the intention

age limit should amazing how would work and to take much effort to make things happen\nWill that one of the interesting thing about this no it doesn't I think would it take is meeting regularly it it takes him techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before you know they have to be eight no\nFiber work eleven on work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little\nUm but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after I'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and had them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and have them meet every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week\nAnd that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted\nUm just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but at pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur ... are you are you sure that this works uh primarily from the fuel or is your science behind\n[noise] well I didn't I think there is a science in the sense that um we did that brainwave study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of in a group\nCalled it group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer because you have these major changes\nWhich are really very very much similar to somebody having a mystical date you know it was somebody having a mystical experience\nPeople get changed during those kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know something major has changed all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember the Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into\nUm the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd that's what we found in a lot of our intention group I mean when I talk about that group in twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year I'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know wanted them with a woman called Andy\nAnd Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know a young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with there in front of a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself certain tanning for someone else and she was one of the people who is intending for that young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a call Adam\nOh man she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so\nCan I tell you any everything about how this works sure absolutely not [laughter] there's a complete X factor here I don't understand but there is something about that power of getting off of yourself and doing for someone else\nThat seems to get a reward for you\nWhich are convinced that work [noise] aren't you\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at studying groups over years\nUm you know I ... I run these year long mastered classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were going to do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr then or there's some women that don't get results in the ...\nWell I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year and there was a woman\nWho had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away like there and um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't\nYou know thought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the ... because it's easier to track\nIn terms of the ...\nOh you mean at physical healing well yeah because it's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions that we\nHad a woman with stage ... cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it ride along somebody else with T. M. J. problems those temperature ... joint problems in your job\nAnd uh that she was sort of suffering where the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days\nSo this kind of thing you know it's kind of is healed in an instant or soon after is the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous a cheese happened you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert me so and she was in one of these year long groups and she was trying to write a book about she figured out a way to treat trauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she never written a book and she was getting no where\nShe had three different editors and just nothing was happening and at the group was intending for nothing was happening and finally once again I sent leads to get it off for yourself and she started ... intending to another member of the group who had some serious health issues\nAnd again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store and she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely been introduced to before\nAnd as they got chatting it turns out this woman with a former publisher and is now a book coach and when she hears what Lisa wants to do she offers to coach or through the whole thing\nAnd the story Lisa gets her book done and it becomes an Amazon best seller\nSo I've seen this over and over enough just to have the doubting Thomas and meet start getting pretty persuaded but something amazing is going on here\n... quickly has been brought to you by ... value heating and cooling\nWe're talking Guam Sullivan thirty and teach you in a printed belly Ninety nine point nine MK two sixty ...\n[noise] [noise]\nFox News I'm ... the most powerful hurricane ever to hit Florida Panhandle leads widespread destruction and killed at least two people\nPieces from people's houses flying law you got three flying loss\nLike I say I was crazy and\nDaylight residents get there for a good look at how much damage hurricane Michael caused within one hundred fifty five mile an hour when governor Rick Scott to the states are ready to help\nWe're deploying a massive away their response will be sending help from air land and see the storm uprooted trees peeled away roost\nAnd left nearly four hundred thousand people without power Michael the tropical storm now with the not possible tornadoes as it crosses Georgia no winner in last night's Powerball jackpot ... rolls over for a chance that three hundred fourteen million dollars on Saturday mega million\nThree hundred and fourteen million dollars on Saturday mega millions on friday is worth five hundred and forty eight you know\n\nThanks for making the talk of the quad cities ... your choice for your early Thursday a chance of showers today and tomorrow after overnight little forty six expect dive sixty one today and the press the quad cities with a high sixty six tomorrow and after all when I lost fifty not one\nOf the ... valley ...

to do when you're formulating an intention\nIs if a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich and you know they don't really want to be rich\nWhat they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is they don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so will you have to do is try and figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want\nAnd the other thing I notice George is oftentimes the universe give it as what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like\nUm I had one group one master class intention group of eight and they said well were intended for all of us to win the lottery [laughter] and I said to them why what do you need and they said well gene needs twelve thousand dollars\nI'm for child and Joan needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you\nYou know so it's it's really about first of all figuring out what you want exactly and then telling\n... yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with blue Mick Jagger Nevada intention looks aren't going to Thomas a mobile you California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb that's really a pleasure comment and then a question um I ... just you know your audio watcher programs one called living the fields\nAnd the other one called living with intention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player\nI just want you to know that they're just saps so much information now you you think about\nRetro causality retro in ... and you cite a number of experiments that\nAppear to prove that we can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not\nFixed in stone so to speak out there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be our rural bust cross talk between the past and the future and you cite Aleppo v shape how much met a job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did\nThat appear to show that you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention\nRetro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short\nGreat question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes\nNow I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop semi just ran a retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention\nOne I tend to do though is\nHe can't change the past of what of what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is changed your response to it and going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic\nTime being one big smeared out now\nAnd that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that\nAnd this is a weird thing um we don't change the past we changed present as it unfolds the future affect the present as it unfolds all those studies show\nBut just to answer your question why tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nA moment in their health just when something just started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argue with somebody in a relationship\nAnd it then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started off for a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were just terrible at some things we just just did something like that and to go back and change your response\nTo that teacher and you say no I'm not used to sit math I just don't understand this now I Will later\nSomething like that or nitrogen that that healing that that illness doesn't blow up into full blown disease\nI actually had somebody who got vigil I go from an infection go back and imagine that time and I swear to you she told us her skin was starting to re pigment in the workshop it was extraordinary and loads of people where\nThey were they were told something and it's in a sense released it for them going forward to it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with ritual intention because even standard physicists now are saying to us at all\nUm you know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here hey rich go ahead\nYes can you

across\n[noise] well I think it was\nThe probably the film any instance healing and I think that it was really shocking to me\nThat it wasn't just health that we've healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that\nI'm not for instance Natalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this\nShe was one of the receivers in a power of age group and she wanted her intention to be that her family business expand in all directions and be prosperous in all ways\nAnd and she and her husband had a computer support in business but he didn't build on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere and they were really worried because\nThey had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about a decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy animals so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive so she can't during the group\nSession she kept visualizing both her and mark\nOpening up their car doors and money spilling out and afterward her feeling about it here and there depression seemed to lift\nBut what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months she they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diverse to provide their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of a certain offers she paints has a hobby and she was a given offers to do her painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business training for programs that took off\nAnd it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of age group not only performed magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity\nAnd I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch everything in people's lives begin to heal\nAnd you do develop intention in your dream state\nThat's a great question I think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know we're intending you know somebody called up dreams R B roll you know we got weird weird stuff going on there and dreams thought\nThey are often times ... cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow I was really interested to find that that um a lot of people\nA lot of people pre dreamed that nine eleven um are ... tax um Rupert shell Drake did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it\nOf planes going into buildings that has a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific dream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people\nUm cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank\nAnd somehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all all kinds of information ahead of time if not beyond the realm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happen and we're thinking about it\nThe key though is I think being really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his his illnesses you know his pain\nAnd I really got to say that the one way is to get a power of aid group together\nBecause let them in ten for you to be very specific about where your pain is that you want to kill\nThe pain and you're you know if you've got a pain in your left tow I'm left big toe you know focus on that the really really specific about it and if you don't have I should say if you don't have seven other good friends to be part of physically\nAnd friends to be part of physically\nWe had a place on our Web site limit ... dot com forward slash forum which allows people to just sign up\nUh either advertise that they want a group in their time zone where they can joined an existing group and we have hundreds and hundreds of groups that are meeting all the time on there so you can just set up a group virtually that way\nHave

point drop on the dollar yesterday what's that mean\nIt means the market below almost forty percent than that Donald Trump got elected in the opposite [laughter]\nBut no reason to worry no reason to be upset just part of a normal correction in advance of the market\n\nYou know President Obama had the advantage of basically having free uh money out in the uh the economy at zero percent interest rate on the bad habits are saying and this is just kind of a ... a great economy\nUm that that has decided that rate or the interest rate and the market itself is raising interest rates because the dollars strong right but this is just kind of a natural reaction\nOut at all it indicates is that the dollar strong in the economy is hot\nNow the job creator network carriers mostly about jobs as given by the name and tax cuts work dot com care is mostly about tax cuts how integral or the ladder to the former\nAh I probably completely into girl and we looked at the overall\nThat one of the things we got a number is looking at the unemployment rate for of all and job all of the lower regulation the less read a lower taxes had on the on the weak point seven percent unemployment rate it that you know you know that's the lowest rate licensed to Neil Armstrong walk on the moon\nBut it is it is a kind of remarkable thing that people are taking it for granted but I saw bowling this morning suggesting that the American people are not connecting the tax cuts what this is perfect economy why is that message getting through or is that in fact bad polling Alfredo Ortiz\nNow and you know he I think that that is probably correct point and I think part of it is when when people kind of forget when times were bad right forget that we had an unemployment rate that was about ... percent um that we had the Nina growth rate of less than two percent\nUm that we hadn't seen growth rate the left in super center the bomb in this race and then ... you know ... or point two percent
