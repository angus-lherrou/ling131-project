to be very brief about it across all kinds of scientists from cyclical research the quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time from

playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said this you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we\nIt's a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like to ... a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post the you interested and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this I started getting into the monkeys\nAnd I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose\nFor money or time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we think it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason\nSeemed to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is that wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started playing a long long time ago if I remember one of the members was Mickey ... that's right who played shook his boy on television\nRight that's right and and still touring still touring\nYou still going that's giant absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter]\nAnd do you know the name ... gallon burger buddy chance I don't ... wrote a couple books one called liquid luck Paul for her life I Know the book I think he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas with groups of people mhm any which is trying to prove\nThat positive thinking and the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's right and and he is totally convincing these convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat\nAnd you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Rhein pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased\nAnd one of the things that Jay be found and he just buried that's in the foot notable book with its monumental\nThat when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive\nTheir scores spiked when they were bored when they were down cast when they were ... their scores death and it was inevitable ... bike followed mood it's the same thing that he says and the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't have to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason you know it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again that's one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really want it you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning and Vegas where the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to truly identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch or what's his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\n[noise] you know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was a road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research why don't I write about the methods why don't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves\nAs believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like for the post surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George\nAnd lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't mean that we don't live under many laws and forces\nBut if one can understand how much that means\nYour thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments that the thoughts change the brain\nYou were sustained thoughts were actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so have fought changes the brain and fly has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWhen we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel to check that one of the things that I read about in the book\nIs that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nAnd you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances are going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're fortunate that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\n... going to come back and talk more about your work\nThe miracle club next hour and we'll take phone calls questions and miracles story\nFor you to watch a TV show beyond belief with your

to coast to coast George or you whether you along with Mitch Horwitz says we talked about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well it's not as easy as pie tune into this mess you were talking about it briefly but ah I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nOr there is without question you know ... we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments to ESP ... telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the SP lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five census once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence\nOutside the fence said body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize we are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people to help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us\nHalfway and as I was mentioning in the last segment J. B. rhyme the grade ESP researcher found that ESP results spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important\nYour thoughts are what actually happens to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way you get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must wanted with everything in you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions do we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is\nSecurity we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what you want\nOver time you're going to get through people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus activity but my\nUrging people my urging to people and this is something lister is can do right now is to sit down with a pencil and paper and for a mature stand sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants [laughter]\nThink about this dwell on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it being intimate and see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote\nAnd they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually have\nMitch how close you echoed the secret that story corps at different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term law the traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experience many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying in the previous\nSegment and so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak\nThey are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou're right about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nIt can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say gee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is\nYou may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time [noise] linear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered in the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in in in a tube of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to you\n\n\n\n\n\nSignificant difference between being slightly out of gene or a perfectly in financial planning slightly out of you may be too much for taxes exposing yourself to too much risk retiring was at a sound you\nListen to eleven thirty AM Ninety nine nine and Ninety five weeks on Sunday then nine AM financially do Stevenson of American interest in the future into\nJogging Guam eleven em you in a ballet\nA ... eleven thirty AM cake you in a preppy belly and on Ninety nine point nine up MK two sixty ...\n[noise] [noise]\nFox News none Carmen Robert secretary of state Mike Pompeo will meet this morning with the king Solomon did discuss what happened to journalists ...

though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city when they just can't seem to get ahead and this would lead me to my second question of people really have a hard time just\nVisualize scene where they might end up and then I Want to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in skull Harry New York ...\nDouble ...\nI ... I was reading some of their bio's and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives you know one because there was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trap\nBut these people Mr Horwitz above upper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives\nWere coming to an end and yet you say a from a ... a higher exalted background that people should know but that that they were like many people are and society they\nThey were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen in a limo not one spoke\nUp to say this has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like she does say it they went to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city and seen my fellow city residents many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves\nI'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep so many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just\nSpeak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this stop and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we have the story the night it happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by should tell somebody to stop what was going on inside that bloom all ...\nAre there are indications that the car was basically do use my term coming apart that there are people were saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other or talk to the car was being caught me very noisy and\nAnd literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough of for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably\nHigher ... middle class of jobs where they should have had the smart the know how just to say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know a because you've heard me before me teeth that driver would have pulled over no if fans who are being you know I I Would\nHave wanted to be in a limo would you you would have stopped that guy ...\nYou know with the there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep is saying and of course I I read the same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws and forces and I've never including law of accident including accidents of birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because they can be a kind of group mentality regardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think is dangerous\nIt's vitally vitally important if everybody act with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates\nThat participates in other things that are going on and it is extremely important to exercise it at all times you're never without devices\nExercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on\nThe accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing\nForces socially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool in your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment it is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function\nAnd that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that that the mind as extra physical properties\nThat doesn't mean that necessarily determines everything\nAnd every force occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to ... to California Hi Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up beat interview hearing gallery I'm very grateful hectic and match shovel comment and question I'd like to share a miracle short you know I regularly listen to an audio program in which you match\nMarried her nap audio program as novel God or it's more like you're out you know\nAnd I hope you write about metal Goddard and your upcoming book miracle club I Do have a whole chapter on him called mirror man it's one of the longest chapters in the book actually oh fantastic fantastic just fall off ... ... and his whole idea that\nYour imagination is here reality you know half the outside of dance but it's your own human imagination yes creates\nYour reality yes\nYes noble is truly my hero and for any listeners who haven't heard of him he was a British bar Baden mystic who've lived and worked in America died in Nineteen Seventy two and as the caller was describing metal taught that your imagination is God and that the God of scripture Old Testament New Testament is really a metaphor\nFor your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing it right now is really coming from within you it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you\nAs you are old Timothy rooted in God and that everything that happens to your relationships your experience you're listening experience right here and now\nIs really you're a motive thoughts of mental pictures pushed out into the world so that was metals teaching that your imagination is God he was very simple he was very practical and I write about him and the miracle clubs he has been the greatest\nSource of inspiration in my life\nMitch show would you give us your Web sites and folks and how they can get those membership card into the miracle club again\nOh sure thing website is ... dot com if you just throw my name into Google or whatever search engine you'll find it if you go to the website my email is there it's my real email I answer everybody who writes to me or you can ask me for the miracle club card you could ask me for the thirty day\nA mental challenge instruction sheet I also pray every day at three PM eastern time if you have a prayer request I'm happy to do it for you\nAnd you get into a routine don't you\nOh yeah I really I hear from coast listeners all the time and I respond to every one of them and I love your listeners because I find that there ... there are people who experiment with things who actually try things and and and I I I Love hearing from every one of them\nYou say you can lose weight you can get stronger you can do all kinds of things he's using the power the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I give the details and the miracle clubs or harbored a clinical psychologist named Ellen Langer she did a study on the hotel maids\nShe found that if she explained to hotel maids the fact that their jobs are actually robotically an anaerobic Lee healthy and then studied the maids for six weeks compared to a control group who had been told nothing she found the group that had been educated about the aerobics benefits of their jobs\nActually lost weight they didn't do anything differently they were just in that you needed to realize that their jobs or anaerobic Lee anaerobic Lee healthy they lost weight and their blood pressure were lowered just because they had been educated about that fact can mind a loan to help you lose weight answers apparently yes\nI Love it we're coming back for final questions next on coast to coast they um\nGet Daily Show updates right to your inbox for free was the coach knew newsletter sign up today it goes to goes am dot com\n\n\nThem to get moving your free\n\n\nWalking back her final segment with the metro which as we talked about his work the miracle club the books available for you and we'll get to your calls as well fascinating work much in what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road tested and I treat every reader has I would've member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life I Need to do that\nYou know Georgia it's simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that's familiar to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture\nI made the determination and I read about this and the final chapter of the miracle club that once I had come to feel that linear time was\nBasically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely an all at once\nIf you can actually enter into a relaxed meditative state and picture of yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice to younger self or whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice it can change your life right here and now in the present but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience\nAs challenges or tragedies also bring maturity to her life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson\nSo reflect very very carefully\nOn what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that scene imagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self\nBecause by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital or necessary lessons sometimes\nThe aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game this is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence\nYou want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch out is or\nHow does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question\nThe fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select things I think as in the particle lab everything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot\nOr a point in time on that grid we experience it as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now\nSo our actual act of life is an act of\nSelectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once\nAnd we go in and out of these things the way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state\nSelect very carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nLet's go to Mary in Rock Hill South Carolina on the while Caroline ... go ahead\nHello there jarred water play the games are yes char which a lot of it is to hear you on the air I Love it when you're old coast to coast you're stuck\nIn a day and positive person during a thrill the same way thank you so much appreciated ears by by positive they

you're all bummed out you need to change or as you are right now and I did George\nBefore all that I got a lot more hours three of water a doll where\nHe works at war that is\nWonderful you know that is something to thank you very much for sharing that story\nThat is something called the mirror technique which clawed Bristol wrote about and I think George is familiar with it if you look in a mirror look yourself squarely in the eye and a mirror and stayed in a positive manner what you want to occur it seems to have an effective magnifying your psyche club group called it the mirror effect\nIt's so simple it's too simple not to try just as a friend was describing ... looking at him or you can do it right now and just a surge in an emotionally persuasive way\nThis is going to happen this is going to unfold be positive be productive there's something about gazing at yourself in the mirror that seems to magnified effects of the psyche just like the caller was describing\nWe now go to any in Alabama I low any\nTeachers who are you sure the morning\nI turned the speaker phone off they go off\nI don't know what go ahead\nAre you hearing me All right I'm hearing you sure
