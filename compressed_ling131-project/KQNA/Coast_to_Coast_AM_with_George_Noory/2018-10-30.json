really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel right no arguing yeah kind of what's what's going to happen going forward ... ... is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people and a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about Dana's remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your

[laughter]\nThat's good zero in Long Island New York to Joe go ahead I\nCan to question so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more information than a ... and won issue than ... people have a ... you know then and now the ... explosion basically people pick and choose\nA their information uh even at a a professional level what what are the size of the sense that if you look at Japan\nPeople used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost a year and it just hasn't worked out of them individual level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office told them that night or whatever [noise] ah so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon or\nI Know they get criticized putting out small for prior to ... and I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally\nEven even in New York for example I got I got this great gloves the shoveling my neighbors snow and that's the main thing I made but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nRight for the first question again\n[laughter] and so I just ... rolling on Long Island and I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead and use the nonsense again Joe\nJoe\nYou know now that that sort of sample and explosion that video you know like half of everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information was ... at the sun is a because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this plan that's er into something whether it's just so so much of the nation to like\nYou like a carnival of sand on on the ... what good does that do the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your comments Romanians you're quite a lot of information\nThat we get is it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know that if if I'm a lot of the the the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer is\nBut ... how do you sift through this which you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nI come to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with the information in in terms of Amazon\nI think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the interests of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\n[noise] we've done a company that ship you radios they make radios and they make darn good radio she Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want to deliver to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a ... it's it's amazing it's amazing\nIt's infinitely easier you know ... when when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is\nAnd so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow a you know and the online retail ... will exceed you know the temperature where it is now I Would probably go to twenty percent thirty percent I\nThink so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured um the Amazon employees is Julian people um some of which complain about their job there\nUm for conditions and things like that but I mean there are retired people so there's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go really the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work but they can find jobs elsewhere it's real estate that just sits there what's going to happen with that stuff\n[noise] that's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now no no no but but it but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah seller rent out\nYes [laughter] yeah no in fact I'm you know I I have a house in them but it just brings Florida and I and I have a house in in the head of Connecticut and I'm In the house and had our Connecticut's\n... thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattling around in it than what we decided to do is we're going to where we're going to come up with an executive rental forward and and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people come into all areas that don't want to sell ritual has got to be very big\nWhile they've got the company like air being beat up the rent out house houses and I mean now I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ...\nYeah I Would subscribe to that\nWhat you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes one of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to\nYou know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that is actually demanded a you know their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had\nIs a very young right now and just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them

position\nThey aren't there aren't really in an entirely different position and and but they have their own problems there about one point four billion people act we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is that there's more people in India that there are in China but they had about a two and a half trillion dollar\nThere are in China but they have about a two and a half trillion dollar GDP and they went and you know it may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states was twenty\nTrillion or GDP there's really no comparison so it it's it's not India is not enough income are the biggest problem that India has is wealth distribution may literally have haves\nAnd have nots yeah and there's no\nOne in between and uh they they don't seem to be able to get a handle on that\nWhen you have in the hands and have not search you creating civil unrest and everything else\nYeah you would think that but they're kind of a passive people but I you know I I don't know you you you would you would think that there would be kind of an unrest ah because they're poor people are really poor and rich people are really rich\nAnd that's not what it between the two to Josh in Toronto, Canada hey Josh thanks for calling go ahead\nGet evening gentlemen doing great thank you good I'm a longtime listener love your show George here it every night even from are out there thank you Josh thanks for hanging in there with us so long\nAnyway I just wanted to touch base on that Amazon thing I don't know if you or your ... can I don't know if you hurt by\nA Amazon is opening now Amazon Go stores and they're planning to open up a many many more three thousand in total by the end of the top twenty Twenty one have you heard about that I Can't\nI have not and the water goes towards a Josh\nAnd so basically you go in and you pick up a I guess the most popular items and you just buy it right there retail wise and set up on line so it's a retail store Amazon Go you're walking you pick out I guess the items that they have there\nAnd the most popular items I get that selling that monitor that week or whatever and you just pick it up and go get cell phone charger things of that nature uh\nInteresting and then I Would use their website to let you know what products are going to happen in the store at any given time\nI'm sure that that's a great thing for people or of the older generation who don't really feel comfortable with computers they can just walk and pick out what they want to go it's Amazon Go\nInteresting take on Sundays and earlier Amazon goes on as soon as I go I'm going to go somewhere mind with Halloween coming up you know\nThe thing did the concern that that would have about that is the same concern that I had with Amazon taking over a whole foods and that is a when you have a brick and mortar store retailers details of very very different a kind of business at Amazon has succeeded in so I don't know let's let's see what they do with this\nThat couldn't be intriguing yeah could be I ... and get them whenever ... sometimes ... uh people that are successful it get caught up in your own success and think they can do everything everything that's right\nYeah and so the the whole whole foods thing is sort of successful but I don't know I really don't know if they're going to make it with that\nWill soon to know lunar New Orleans sign old and go ahead sir\nGeorge I'm a longtime listener too and you are the best ... team stood truck driver master for eight\nThank you and your age\nI'm the one I'm

mind\nAnd a great man and you're very fair man you know I was going to exercise your guest about um you know you know the abortion issue we're losing a lever because of abortions but at the top of all our heard a kind of a liberal and it was kind of a hurtful where they talked about nationalism being with white Christians\nAnd then at the bottom of the hour I heard about the global elite planning and then when I thought about that and I remember going back to most of the abortions back then\nWe'll we'll white people when you have is Seventy eight eighty million people now I don't know what the abortion number is 'cause I just knew that I had a lot of friends with my customers driving the truck I used to hear about\nA widow lady's gonna adopt baby so that he would just wanted to have an abortion blah blah blah and and it was just a big problem back in the late eighties\nPut them to shorten the story because my phone's going then I'm just wondering um you know the the control with the elite with the abortion and uh and how much we lost the um\nThe work ethic because of abortion\nSo her and the little the chicken or how many ... I I don't know what the county has but what do you think that readers can\nAbout a million a year for a million a year about a million a year and and that it's it's a disproportionate a at a F ethnically south [noise] ah\nWe we have aborted about forty million people\nUh you know in in the last forty years we just out in ... and it's um it's it's a it's a terrible thing I don't think we would have forty million more people if if abortion was illegal\nOr simply because I think people use abortion and birth control I I don't think they use it as a I mean it's it's it's almost like a you know a pill\nAnd most people the people that are going to have four kids are going to have four kids and and if it if you know you have an unwanted pregnancy at a particular time than that they seem to have their abortions\nMary in Portland hey Mary taken away\nFrom ... nice to have high you know my little ... about the health care and Medicare and sang a pair of pants and universal health care and all that where it's going\nWell there are three under served um categories in relative to health care right now one of them is healthcare the others elder care in the last one is death care\nThat cares totally under served if we don't have enough funeral homes we don't have enough cemeteries we don't have enough ... to handle what's gonna happen when the boomers start to die\nElder care is totally underserved health care\nPeople need health care about that there's there's a trigger here and it's it's Seventy five and the baby boomers right now I fifty four Seventy three so two years from now\nYou're going to see a spike in health care or the need for healthcare services like we'd never seen before in the history of our nation\nCan I remember when you were with me a year ago we talked about like marketing Harley Davidson since they miss the boat too didn't they\nYeah Harley Davidson right now the the the ... if you if you if your listeners have a Harley don't try to sell it because you're not going to get anything for a it is because the baby boomers have literally moved on the baby boomers are are fifty four Seventy three years old and a lot of them can't hold the Harley up at a light anymore\nYou know they're going to be by now that generation right behind him is too small to sustain it it it it just as the people I was born I just find the Nineteen eighty four is a small or indigenous generation of about the uh sixty nine million\nPeople use the markets motorcycles going down\nYeah it is that's interesting overall overall is going down to the Japanese brands got stung so bad back in the eighties and nineties where their business fell eighty percent the Japanese brands that they that they just never reconsidered the market\nOnce in a while I'll watch it on YouTube whoa you know what's my line\nIt on YouTube you know what's my line TV show you a little black and white and they will always you know see what's my line with so and so and so and so and then brought to buy and in those days they didn't have sophisticated produced commercials\nThey would do some of them live on the SAT or for that TV show or they'll just take a picture of the product or something like that and I'm looking at talking about trends things have changed I mean in in those days that type of presentation wouldn't work today\nNo it wouldn't it simply wouldn't it our our uh our video sophistication in terms of communicating\nMeans in terms of marketing is off the charts yeah it really is it just it when\nYou can produce you could produce a TV commercial with your phone\nAnd a probably a pretty good one\nOh yeah yeah unless I produced a thousand literally a thousand TV commercials on a on video and film in my lifetime and and to think what you can do now\nIn as quickly as has been brought to you by ... valley heating and cooling it\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM Chait you in a bread to rally Ninety nine point nine FM K. two sixty ...

... where does science fit in\nWell I I've been doing a lot of\nReading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but so I've asked all awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating or just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to\nAnd explained difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model a that is how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on\nNow in ... with that model might be\nWell it it the idea is that a ... okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking\nMy one way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a particle being I I'm a bean physical dean\nBut if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location is is not just in one place so I I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know the ... in the ... world\nBut if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and it and that and and that's kind of how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how how this works and\nThe the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of ...\nI think we have many forks and what I call forks in the road of time I talk about that in the book where we experienced a it may be a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think is where it comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks and the road of times throughout our our our lives and keep\nGoing from one life to the next\nAt but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two there's a physical form and then there's the spiritual form a that it that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really\nEver die\nAnd in timeless you have documented thirty four ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just put 'em all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu\nAnd uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book I saved I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first\nOne well sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you how deja vu because we'll save a lot of it for the next Bork\nBlackout a you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that sometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but there are ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations that's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those are those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California and on a sub surface streets and I\nI look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor monument or whatever and I looked up and\nWhen I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light oh it was terrible and and how old's your son\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out yeah he he is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out of so\nWhat was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I maneuver through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was hockey and going on in the cars went and everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again I mean I I think that\nI think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me\nThere there is no past there is no future it's all just an eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this was probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time 'cause in another dimension which\nWe might have had this horrible accident who knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that uh it you know that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God I'm so it so I I I that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences with you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm up at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a to bridge fans that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you could overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak out for them\nYeah exactly and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then everything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light and the warmth\nAnd the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these other thirty three experiences you had

about any demonic situations have you've stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately that is that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and sure these\nThings as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary out they'll tell you as a couple of them I'm One of them was a a lasts about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down\nI was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of out of the University of Washington living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor on a mattress\nAnd a ... just ... the night before this incident happened I I had cut across you know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I still cut across the yards and jump fences and stuff because just to you know\n'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh any wait 'til she their legend grew by leaps and bounds\nSo I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candlelight in the window and I just momentarily looked in there she was she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all the direction yeah you had this\nShe had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either that it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window\nAnd she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I went in to to I fell asleep well later that probably early in the morning I woke up to a very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor\nThere was like a a call him a fire that was coming up out of the floor and I and I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream and so I pinch myself I slap myself\nAnd no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I I'm not sure how long it lasts that it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nI immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know there's something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh well you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't in writing it happened\nAnd I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or made her angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I Do remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very real to Rio and nothing that it it so I I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get ya and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the demons but tell us the other story\nWell the other one uh also of a foolish kind of thing a ... there was actually a a ... I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison and Mannheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany we're West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a counselor at the prison of all people are counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he was in\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical but interested\nSo we went in there it into his room and he had a this very frightening set up you know the very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and and that stuff so I said well I you know\nListen and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I I thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and\nAnd uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] that that's ceramics instructor there and he I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was\nAnd I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head then it turned out to be a demon head nor did I and fashion and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor then he had the steam analogy book\nAnd uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare the sky and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mineralogy and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate let me and\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm I'm gonna freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go on freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was oh it was the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left or I mean the the uh the roommate left\nAnd I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the sing all of a sudden it's lips started to move and it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard uh before I joined the army\nAnd that that other incident that I told you about\nAnd uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then they kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in and she immediately said what are you doing and I said well your roommate let me in and then she says what does that and she pointed to it and I said oh that's this thing I made to scare the you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she she freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot\nAnd she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other kind of demonic a incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there is don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be somewhat good\nAre these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them and that's when you can have\nTrouble you think human rights of men with a weed you board\nOh I I don't play around with we do boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nI mean you you you you hear the

like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the owning singer I Hope no not at all and we'll just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way\nSo I looked at him as soon as I think he recognizes I looked at him the vibration stopped so I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell a kinetic powers\nBecause it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there the the the items stopped and I\nYou know you know and I didn't have that feeling that somebody pulling me off the bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that and I'm here in\nSt Louis that when you went through that red light and you made it through a lives loser reason you still hear have used to get out what the reason is yeah\nAnd uh it's it's related to what this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but uh I I Do know that I I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to\nSupport people like a scientist like dean rating and others and we're trying to figure this out you know and and our ... you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there's that it's difficult for them to get funding\nAnd I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives as is try to figure out\nHow this the spiritual world works and it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do\nA ... I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me\nI don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know they're Charlotte's ... out there and and then and there are some real people that do for a living and I don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living of it you know fair living songs are providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and uh they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one\nA there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but uh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on in there is a connection being made\n'em and uh so I that that I that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation\nAsk them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and\nThe things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel like I I that I have to do it and I want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kinda like all the books I've written all over the place that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm gonna write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it and I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have helped some people\nLet's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you with bell you waited for is Bruce of it's just a question than they could away Thomas a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I promised my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your near accidents in the intersection\nAnd job comment question or comment is angels appear to be non denominational day a pair of\nChristianity and Islam hand there was some ... some Dow or something and and all of the indigenous tradition was around the world whether they're called angel also being supple light whatever\nMy question to you sent to metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nIntersection how can the average man they average woman\nUp\nCultivate their oil close personal relationship with\nTheir guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is changeable with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I\nI Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often they light lie dormant sure because of you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have they they accept it more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so things kept happening but now I've\nI've learned to through meditation or when I called walking meditation I'll explain it I I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call it out for brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I say a prayer a and I I I Do believe in God and I say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me to connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh making a practice of that type of mindful meditation and\nWhat my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm to be focused but be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be\nYou know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you

that door has opened\nGruesome and said go ahead yeah no that's the best way I can I can explain it I think\nIt's a it's a life lifetime journey and and everybody's had their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and

it on Amazon and uh I think it was on Barnes and noble and maybe some other places but I think the primary places Amazon there seems to be pretty good price on Amazon right now so\nWell that's a great way now let's talk about the story of\nHell\nAnd you've got to the chapter about ill ill is empty colon\nHell is empty well that is the uh ... that's actually one of the uh the the demon stories\nHa okay okay yeah I used\nThe quote from Shakespeare that uh uh the hell is empty all the demons or hear all the devils are here you know that\nSo I yeah I use that and I but speaking about health I think that's a that's a good topic ah that that's one of the questions that I asked my spirit friends uh I said well what happens to the bad people are they they're in the spirit world with you and\nAnd ah they the the answer that I got a was kind of interesting it was well there there are\nThese demonic elements in in the spirit world but they're not necessarily in the same ZIP Code I guess that's\nThe way to describe it uh and I think that what what I understand is that people who have done very very bad things you know on this earth and the physical form a are probably hanging out with those folks in that in that area of the spirit world\nBut they do get a chance to come back and try to make it right and I think that can take a very very long time many probably many incarnations for them to\nTry to to get things right and uh I I think that goes along with with you know like eastern religions to talking about bad karma and that kind of stuff um so that's that's my impression of what to what held may may be\nLet's go to Berlin in ... California your neck of the words Bruce going enrolling\nOh my goodness hello ms snoring and Dr B side they're on a long time listener and certainly a first time caller I'm missing\nOr we met at the borders in Pasadena before a closed hearing your ... years ago only sixteen years old with the numbers lady yeah I'm not sure if you remember that I sure do too I just\nWant to say a how incredibly proud I Am a both of you and especially my professor and what an honor and it's an on both of you please continue doing what you're doing best\nAh my question to to be is um [noise] can anyone tap into this or is this something you're just lucky enough to be born with and able to do and I will take my question off the air\nThank you roll and I know what you're going to see Bruce go ahead\nYeah well I think I think everybody has this the the the capability to do it or do you have the inclination or are you willing to take a chance are you willing to also to protect yourself in in the process to realize that there are\nA you know folds paths here and there and uh so I I I think it is it is possible for anybody like the the last caller a you know the same type of advice that we can we can cultivate these things and and do so very cautiously and carefully and and slowly\nAnd uh and it is something that then I think that the last caller to ah Thomas a had a good point he said all that it unites this idea of angels unites the whole world\nAnd I would I Would go farther and said the paranormal unites all cultures all around the world it's a connection point that we all have and I think as we learn more and scientists help us more I think that's going to connect us more and and then perhaps bring bring better times for us because we certainly need the help\nWell we sure do don't we Renee is with us in San Francisco first time caller Hi Renee\nHi guy a I'm a Bruce I'm before oh George before I get to my question for both\nForgive her asked me to ask you this how I think your email I got my mom died earlier this month\nAnd I thought I came on the air and stuff and Julie yes and I thought the email is still there um hopefully you'll get thoughts on time so they were going to put a little touch with a local radio okay I'm really ... I wanted to ask your opinion about the peace\nAnd um I actually have their first probably ... or coast to coast I about an actual record all over the last about two or three seconds and I want your opinion on this one here when you go [noise]\nOh\nOh oh oh\nOh [noise]\nPretty scary how\nWell it's weird so what do you think it sounds like like almost like a motorboat doesn't it\nWell they're recording the voice of God and my mom is federal um I've got an old fashioned tape recorder and there are ... for about two hours every night and it's been very quiet about it quite well ... are we checked the outlets to see if there was short or anywhere my sister and I\nAnd I actually have\nAny where my sister and I\nAnd there's not I actually have two of these recordings a father several problems if he would like to park it's it's really bizarre if you look at it I Can't explain it uh\nBush what about you what do you think about ... BP's\nWell uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I\nI think that they can be very helpfully because the it folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones\nUh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh items will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location\nTo you know to give you a sign that that through there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that the third that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encounter when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's varies sometimes it's kinda sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing but uh often times it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not too worried about them anymore\nAnd when do you mean by the beach that\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father\nI did a and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else you know uh and uh I got some of the things right and then he told me and I sensed in him a sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nUh I sense that is that something you'd like to share\nYou know with me why you feel that way and he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either and it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with her father wanted to tell her but I\nI couldn't tell her and I am not going to say that the names or whatever but uh so\nIt it sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know was was it emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy sometimes in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness\nOr in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I did not you know relate that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that are maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her\nAnd his ... his saying it might clear the air so to speak and maybe create a better connection and\nAnd the you know that's what I'm hoping but I I Can't force of these things you know just like\nMessages from my you know from my spirit friends I you know they want me to connect\nA and I can't force myself on their loved ones if they're not willing to hear you know the ... with the messages you have to that there's a time and place you know\nGiven as quickly as been brought to you by ... valley heating and cooling\nFor the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM change you in a rally in Ninety nine point nine of them came to sixty meal for\nFox News I'm Jill Nate how President Trump heads to Pittsburgh today as the first funerals are held for the victims and Saturday synagogue shooting he tailed sponsors the Ingram angle\nWell I'm just going to pay my respects I'm also going to the hospital to see the officers and uh some of the people that were so badly hurt so and I really look forward to going\nAbout a dozen rabbis telling the president in a letter not to go until he denounces white nationalism are you ready for the annual invasion us\nCensus Bureau says forty one million potential trick or treaters between the ages of five and four team will be out there across the country the Census Bureau also finding a hundred and twenty million US homes plan to hand out candy ...

I think you know this packet at one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on attacking Islamic radical radicalization\nAnd how can it has radicalized so many more people than I have a good I mean the way he talks the wasteful waste is that says it is the way the way they see a allows the way he went on to the ... the way he said I Know I'm not that fast and the\nNational watch it on the train stops that's not the only ... ... you see David Urban just shaking his head he's just honest and uh uh I'm astonished to\nUh I I'm absolutely astonished that that Jake didn't stop her right there but later in the program they went back because many people jumped on it many people saw that and CNN was flooded with comments\nAnd so Jake gave her the opportunity to revise and extend her remarks and she apologized for what she called overheated rhetoric and I had an exchange of Mollie Hemingway on and put her last night that sometimes people fall into rhetorical a swamps\nQuicksand and you got to give them a chance to get out in Mali point that Julia Ioffe has done this repeatedly she's falling into rhetorical overstate and repeal it maybe that is true I don't pay much attention to her she's not very serious writer not a very serious an analyst\nBut I Do know that if I hear something like President Trump has radicalized more people than ISIS then I stopped the show but I stopped my shirt say wait a minute what do you what are you trying to say here\nAnd I would insist on a correction\nBut the trouble with cable right now is it's becoming\nShow increasingly circular so insular so absolutely self reverential that they're losing their hearing they can't hear people say crazy things joy I have said something that was crazy and that is unacceptable\nLindsey Graham was in Nevada rallying for Dean Heller who as I told you I I keep my eye on the Senate more than anything else because the Senate means the judiciary as well as the Republicans being able to negotiate I bought the house definitely I Want the house I think we can hold the house but I I definitely we've got the hang on to the Senate\nAnd Dean Heller is one of the keys a female or when there's no way Democrats even get close to a Senate majority in two years Lindsey Graham was in Nevada last night and here's a clip of what he had to say about Democrats who think the country are going in the wrong direction and radical left us who are not Democrats number seven\nYear Democrat you think you're going to say something about it and you'll be last year the radical left who's trying to destroy the country in his mind [laughter]\nI'm a play that again because\nLindsey illustrates exactly what I'm trying to tell you every day there is a radical left it is represented on cable a lot it's Kathryn ramp all in the Washington Post today saying you are all responsible you people every Republican is responsible for the murders in Pittsburgh and the pipe
