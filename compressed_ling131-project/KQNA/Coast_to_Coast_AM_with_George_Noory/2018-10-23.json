program Jon go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your ... and Robert\nRobert Robert a great question do you go um\nOh probably pick 'em up here [noise] they're sort of speculative for the first is um the you know anything about Mr leader to go in the literature in the anti gravity back in the sixties\nAnd ... you know anything about possible reversal of being able to generate artificial gravity\nAnd secondly you know anything about electrical record ... from\nAh let me ask both of those three questions you know one one more Robert one more okay one more\nWhen you are the third one is um would be viable to design a space station like a memorial type thing to test um oh ... reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just run them down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one of the Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the space craft\nCreates and cheer physical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view or a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with 'em\nAnd see where gravity for a long\nLong long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey they get somewhat of a work out because they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo outlet won't be able to do anything for it\nRight and and the the the third question was electric repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount of electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate at ... pounds to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric breast or that you can with the chemicals roster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm\nYour power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electric propulsion systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world okay you Florida the car and you know in San Francisco and um you know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go\nDriving around the world because your car can drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great\nBut if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electrical pulse and then it does with chemical bullshit if because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nPick Mars you would um be costs\nYou know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did uh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe\nAnd Mars has got much more resources so many to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the\nChoice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon to way North America compared to Greenland you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world but you know here's NASA and frankly it doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to the moon well\nTo take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to the moon well but I say is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars and get on with it go to the moon don't come off with\nSome other things but it's a halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the ... now\nHow can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon with the first time fifty years already rubber word the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree to the Rockies ... with us Long Island New York age oh go ahead\nRobert I'm Sorry you didn't get to go to the mall but a couple of questions are in deep space or what we found out these pro\nOr would you uh uh what would you\nBe dealing with extreme tape even open space as opposed to the planet\nAnd would it be advantageous comic gold to mercury though with some sort of probes and came back here we have water wake a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with C. O. two increases\nIn other words what the spin off of dealing with whipped cream base help us to deal with it potentially back here and also what kind of similar profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate a travel on a ship ... tomorrow what type of program we look for\nAll right let me take your questions one at a time\nOf the first question it be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you or a far away from the sun it's called a and if you're in earth orbit it kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\nUm but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can you can get the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that\nUh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back will let them finish up your questions there and they're interested in what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in a moment of coast

by the way are linked up at ... dot com but Robert you you have to look at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what are they like\nWell I'm One of those sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that you might well want on a crew a fix on a Mars and others not a chance on the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars\nUm and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would like to go on a ... a a hiking X\nGo on a ... a a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration uh adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with a guy in a sense of humor a you know or not you know a grouchy um and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our one for all in all for one\nYou want to take to Mars what's going on with the your August comfort you're working on [noise]\nUh well we're having another conference a in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um it it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles\nUm and ah I'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or do you say the gateway or is it a toll booth\nOkay you know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know there's a marsh probe on its way it's going to land in November ... insight\nAnd it's going to find out how a geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and he'll probably have um a\nDiscovery from ... um there's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars\nOr am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will probably discover thousands what's done I'm ... pass 'em you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's a probably have space X people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get blue origin people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket company like factor space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to\nCreate small watches you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense I'm and I'm a I myself I'm involved and design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar\nWith for satellites each of which are the size of a shoe box um and so little launcher slice this could really play a role I'm\nAlready sick if you recall ... first time caller Armand in a bill gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water\nA NATO ally or on ... if you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I Am G. L. dot com like international your water international and the reality is that it's already been demonstrated on this planet\nBut the water comes from a magnet below that whatever you got the ... the planet fractured that water that hydrogen and oxygen element to hundreds option can make it too late to the surface to move back in areas of growth and there's a war of the earth the structure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the saying look back to their in fact the largest ... in the solar system of the Olympics moms are bars where it gets over eighty thousand feet tall just break digits there they're called they're on top\nAnd that's what hurt or provide Scott city or lava flows that happened so that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet\nAnd it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations for Mars trip\nWell said rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes we found glaciers in this probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either organisms to hear from you know chopped up media writes a slow off the planet\nOr or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the skiing I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true\nAh in not civilizations but not microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could\nWhich either means one or two things that life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough\nFor life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that when you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit by meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise] um\nIf life could evolve quickly out of chemistry it would've on Mars Mars coup before ... Mars had liquid water before or is it sort of life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that a key for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria really pretty complicated they have this\nPicture of DNA in are in a whole outfit that for transmitting genetic information\nUm you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that I had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and uh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before\nYou know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out\nSo uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that they came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars ...\nInterstellar space I just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert split Nick that didn't pore yeah\nWell I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was five when Sputnik flu and while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was just great ah because what it was proving was that the um the space hearings a story\nUm be space hearings are stories that I was reading we're going to be true\nAnd I can remember reading about uh like it a space dog in my weekly reader and later a um ... and ... the next space dogs and\nYou know I'm I have a dog today her name is ... and I'm a beat the struggle was the first off to come back from space alive and she even had puppies and Khrushchev gave one to Jackie Kennedy\nAnd um and her descendants are alive today um anyway so um\nI remember that was cool I was a little kid them but I also remember how my parents were horrified over Sputnik was a little tiny thing the size of a basketball and you know Americans were just panicking how come\nWell because if they could throw it into orbit it means they could throw it here a number it's splitting it meant they could hit anywhere anymore you know and it also meant they could throw reconnaissance satellites up into orbit see anywhere\nWas my birthday belly heating and cooling\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM cake you in a preppy belly and on Ninety nine point nine MK two sixty ...

I knew we had\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are are vying mentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans May New we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael ... hour who categorize these environmentally sensitive people\nUm and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have you know long standing allergies chronic pain for tea migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light found in my city and smells\nMore than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be find other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place to get bashes [laughter]\nSo he's environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population\nUm there's some higher it's a really high number\nAnd with the thought of as as these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's ex federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio and the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment to tune into things\nBut some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAnd they're picking up on things and that and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected are registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real I think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity\nSo there's science behind it and then there's also sign saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that and then that's kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people didn't realize how sensitive they are picking up these things do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in in in when I go out there and I ... my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are mentally sensitive and what you find is you know not only or do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences\nBut it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on\nSo this is something kind of like most you know genetic diseases or or what not this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment is um\nSort of to the environment um just by walking into places some people\nYou know like I said get rashes um they can be on their neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity or for these types of people just experience a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively than it does positively\n[noise] you know you talked about some of the reality television shows brand and my criticism of them\nBecause they always seem that they have to

lean towards that that fried type of\nThing so we've we've talked about the individual who might have the ability to spots goes to fuel goes more than others but what about the goals to self or there's some does that come back more often than others or because they have an ability to do that\n[noise] um I think it's really I guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up go slant counters a lot more than everyone else\nSo I might pick up on a ... and counter of a civil war soldier I'm very often if I'm really\nSense I mean a good a good radio or real good radio probably from Ukraine has the ability to pick up a weak signals from a radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a good receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up these ... things\nExactly yeah exactly so you know it and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental than for the person\nUm they're going to have way way way more votes encounters and um so I think it has to do fear prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much the girlfriend counter the environment\nBut you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff\nYou know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however one location I'm picking up a lot of um having a lot of goes Lee phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places it\nSo then you start asking yourself why why that place and in wide eyed the other places um so then you have to go into why is the location have more um paranormal phenomenon ... out of that other locations\nYou know like those antennas we had the rabbit or one\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and it's kinda figured ration is that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture and the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients\nAre variable of that line up the habit goes counter location is one person has to 'em and then there's there's probably other ones that I you know we haven't really identified at this point\nBut the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric a consciousness of all this stuff really plays into it and it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV him to know\nYou know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little knob on it that you clicked in and brought in the signals better that way too and I taught for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brandon\n[laughter] and I remember those two [laughter]\nDo you know or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I get that question a lot though the the team of question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so\nI think you know when you have a go sleep counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great uh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good the bad weather positive with that this was at that\nAnd I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic ... demonic and theme is\nMore of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective so usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know regular goes\nI think there's more of a religious pills to it um that's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um\nSo I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience um and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part of things\nSo I I really just enjoyed not enjoy it but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nWell with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies his website called ...

... author of the studies of brand new can you you you interviewed a number of people with some peace studies let's talk a couple of them some of your favorites with yeah\nSure sure uh so I have several accounts that I go over I'm the first one it actually because Halloween approaching I'll I'll I'll go with this one\nPerfect um trigger tonight [laughter]\nMy wife passed away unexpectedly over the summer while it's been difficult I managed to care for the house and myself\nAt Halloween approached I was putting up decorations advocated a neighbor usually allow trick or treating\nMy wife and I had bought a plastic pumpkin together when we first got married Twenty years ago we have places ... plastic pumpkin at our window every Halloween I searched outs for days looking for that punk until I finally gave up a few days after giving up I was walking down the staircase and I was shocked to see my wife standing at the bottom\nShe smiled and whispered checked buying the workbench and then vanished I began to weep uncontrollably and rushed out to the garage a huge smile came across my faith and the plastic punk and was laying behind the workbench it must have fallen off the top shelf\nSo this is a a great example of a you mentioned before an intelligent hiding or ghosts interacting with us\nSo in this case you know the ghost during his ghosts and counter the go outta conscious and she was actually giving information that the husband wanted so they're aware of their surroundings they they're giving information they're not sort of confined to an area they're interacting with the witness\nUm they're not like routine specific like they don't just show up every day on this or on the twenty fifth of mayor on Christmas Eve or anything like that\nSo this direct interaction I'm sort of the ... the cream of the crop when it comes to go slowly encounters\nA and these are among the most rare ones that I've been talking with people these are the most rare when you have like um that you know in in college and the interaction the giving information which is verified um this is sort of what we all seek in a way of those who investigate the paranormal\nWho's or a pecking order on the other side brand in in in your opinion on what's already I mean who sends to go back to do what it does does it do it on its own more is there some organization that's involved in doing that on the other side\nI'm a strong believer and and conscious so you know who who we are as people are are personality our memories are um everything that we are um after we die you know what happens to that right\nOr some people will say that we're just computers and when we die who everything of who we are memories or it just seems to exist\nUm and that's kind of mainstream scientists view but when you look at things the consciousness survive death and that goes in it and it continues to exist\nIf it could maybe really be in the environment to some degree and I think when needed maybe like ... example with the husband when needed he can sort of resonate or or link up with the consciousness of his past life\nSo I don't think it's a pecking order as much as you know someone just really need something and then they sort of resonates with the consciousness of of a path love one and then these experience may be happening\nSo yeah you know I I really believe that there's obviously things in the environment that we don't know about and that consciousness I'm electromagnetic fields all this stuff that really happens in the environment is is really important uh Michael pursing or who recently passed away a vote in the narrow psychologist basically said\nAnd he did all of the numbers behind this but that the environment holds enough energy for every every person that ever ever lived their consciousness to exist in it\nUm which means we have access to memories from Abraham Lincoln civilian a kid it's it's all out there and the environment has enough energy to store all that and then maybe some people can just connect with that or resonate with that and that's when he's great experiences happen\nWhat do you say the skeptics Brandon who say these people who have these encounters or mentally unstable or something even worse\nYeah unfortunately I think you know when someone tells you it goes way encounter um a lot of people will just kind of say oh you're crazy and they kind of said jokingly but it really makes the other person feel like they're you know they might be crazy\nUm so you know what I usually tell people who the skeptics or or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen\nSkeptics or things like that I usually just basically kind of go over listen you know in in my experience it's all I Do all day to diagnose mental health and and um you\nKnow you see at all\nYeah I mean my job I I worked in the ER for seven years so I just did behavioral health assessments unmet floors in the ER and I've I've done probably five thousand assessments them over the course of ten years\nUm so I Know how to parcel out you know significant mental health issues and all these real life and counters that I've come across um Ninety nine point nine percent of them are from people who were genuine and had a subjective paranormal experience\nThat's huge yeah you know and and I think that it's easy to say oh you're crazy or this or you're that or your unstable or your looser dating or you're drinking too much or withdrawing or whatever the situation is\nBut less than ... in my professional opinion a lot of these ghostly encounters are just that there are genuine and the people's eyes it's not the result of mental illness\nWell I've always found that skepticism as healthy as long as opposed to skip the ...\n... exactly exactly you know it's it's really easy to beef you know a steadfast believer or a steadfast skeptic because you can just in golf\nYourself and whatever your reading journals magazines books\nAnd it's really easy to sort of said on everything is everything is not a goes through everything that goes it's being in between an open minded that's the most rewarding and challenging because you have to take those side you have to read the skeptical stuff and you also have to read\nThe believe the believers stuff and you have to have common sense in a way and sort of parcel out what's you know what's fraud are fake or just\nPeople being overzealous and then come up with your own conclusions and that's where you're right the open mindedness part is is a central when it comes to being involved and apparently\nI was sick for a pretty much a majority of my life what change do\nYou know when\nPeople would tell me and I was really interesting to parents like college like I said before but I never had that experience so I always kind of thought well people who are having experiences\nMaybe they're just misinterpreting things and just getting it wrong so when people tell me experiences I Would kind of sit there and they're talking I won't even listen to him I Would just sort of go over how to debunk yet or what could be happening\nAnd then I just sit back and I'm going to start listening and I started listening\nAnd I'm like oh okay and then I started picking up books like um Carl Young's collective unconscious shell Drake stuff\nI'm over ... life feels ... Raman Moody's work yes exactly a near death experience it all this stuff and you start reading it and you go wait a minute there's actually this might be happening and then you go deeper down the\nRabbit hole and you're reading research articles about untangle matter\nAnd then you kinda go wait a minute this is actually somewhat possible and then you know as far as ... the and things like that\nI mean the research on that is growing every year um but I Know every year I'm reading more and more journal articles which statistically give credence to the idea that come up at the end ESPN the sigh phenomenon is legit\nAnd then you're like whoa wait a minute if all this is saying this and he's grossly encounters could be possible as well and that's kinda what led me into it from a skeptical to more of a believer part of thing\nHe was another one of your favorite stories\nOr I I got a lot of them so uh [noise] we'll go with will go with one that's been pretty popular here recently has to do with dementia is um and just finished eating dinner and wasn't a kitchen cleaning things up and that was placing items in the dishwasher I happened to look in the dining room I was shocked\nTo see a huge black void about four feet high and four feet wide hovering above the ground I immediately thought something was terribly wrong with my eyes I looked away rub my eyes and then look back in the void was still there\nAs I Walk closer I could see a mother and child inside the voice the mother and child were sitting in the grass talking and smiling law enjoying the bright sunny day\n... quickly since been brought to you by ... valley heating and cooling\nWe're the dog in the quad cities eleven thirty AM change you in any ...

something logical and operations we starting to get the next town that led to pronounce it got anything out there now and then when he became a deacon new we had to hire and\nCertainly not Lincoln job\nYou know it's it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environment of the resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to goes into it\nWe teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible or early imprint teams and the brain that might explain to an extent\nWhy people see ghost like others I've seen film of the baby ... chicks being fed by humans would hand pop it's made to look like the mother so wouldn't return to the wild the ships\nNoted key in on a mother ... or ... you mentioned the window or who was searching for the pumpkin and his wife appeared and then goes gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three\nI Will rub my eyes in various ways and all different kinds of\nFigures will appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a occurred with an me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that those are not close by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that lake with a winner or a scene his wife saying look in a in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens\nCan people be so emotionally attached to mentally like a husband to his wife that he would see his wife worse and the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life would be things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah yeah it's\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not seeing Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars uh there's radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio stations in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five because we're matching frequencies\nSo with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience has happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing a ... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes in and with sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening\nSo this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar sort of vision and stories and things like that\nSo I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro than macro when it comes to this collective archetypes that are out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nDoes religion kind of changed your views about these ... ... donors\n[noise] yeah I think it's it it changes our view is that it's basically changes our perception of an experience so\nIt's likely changes our perception of an experience\nSo you know you have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might\nPerceive that as more of um like we talked about earlier I deem aunt or an angel or I'm a of of aside from from God or aside from a deceased person that they love\n'em whereas the person who doesn't have that religious tell to it might experience that I simply you know an experience or or\nUm mundane thing or a vigorous stimuli so everyone of everyone's pass sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's what we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe our spirits everything is that are found spirit a so I think perception religion or they play a huge part and how we perceive a ghost encountered the paranormal phenomena\nHave you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I never witnessed that\nWould you like to [noise] um [noise] as long as it's not yours [laughter]\nYou know I was somewhat although I did interview a while back and

going to go back to ... just a moment you're\nSuddenly in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these mutations occurring she she's not there anymore luggage reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] oh that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that you know this is somehow I'm ghosts are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phones tax\nEmails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich encompasses a great he he's less a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace messages what just recently came out as well which goes over this is well\nIt's hard to really know that that to me I mean listen this is the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is utilizing electrical of electrical equipment has been going on for a while so\nYou know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure but anytime we talked about this numerous times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events\nLike she was talking about um it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistent Caesar's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nChange skeptics mine brand new\nI think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening uh it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point ghosts are measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable or will which is essentially everything that the scientific method hates 'em so these things are are tough and and isn't that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imagination um\nYou know when it is not a cop out though to be able to just to say that\nI think it's an ... a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is if it's if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say that the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind it any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know it's it's pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures and easy piece\nUm but there's really no follow up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI think really is and it's just kind of what I tell people out in the paranormal investigator is is you gotta of it's about collecting data it's about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance a field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia and and with skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know of three hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variable or um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue with someone who has a a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of

Brandon what's a Spanish so you're only Eighteen hundred doing there\nThat this is this is a fascinating story and and these are the stories are really good to me the most excited about this phenomenon right so how could there be a ghost of something that shouldn't be there right so if you have a house for a hundred and fifty years and there's no tragedy happening\nAnd all of a sudden there's a civil war goes that appears there right and it's houses in Montana where there shouldn't be civil war goes why is that\nWell I think and and I go over I have a whole chapter devoted sort of

right\nNow\nSo let's say we skip I had a hundred and fifty years into the future someone buys my brother's house and know tragedy happened there no nobody died there was a it was it was great place to live for all those years\nThey walk into a room and they see an operation of me and they go what the heck is going on here now the operation of me is that because I died and my brother's house it's

rally\nIn Pittsburgh last night but I was a tough one a railing against the president now it was a battleground soccer's door event in Pittsburgh obviously with you and a lot of colleagues Michael my bed and others I'm sure it was quite a bit but ah\nAh you had that deal in Pittsburgh while battling the uh the illness that took his voice from him yesterday so I'm very happy to be sitting in for them today\nFrom the pre really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer\nIn Cleveland so the president a rally last night as a mentioned are for Ted Cruz but also rallying for himself and for just the conservative Republican vision\nIn this country and why it is it's so important is so integral for the Republicans to not only a hold on to but maybe expand their majority in the United States Senate but also to try to hold off\nA the Democrats whether it be a waiver a trickle just we cannot let them are in it but the president says of course\nI'll take over the house we cannot deal with Speaker Pelosi we cannot deal with a Democrat the shareholders I'm a chair persons of various committees a which will wipe out important investigations are ongoing right now which will start new investigations that will be politically motivated and more so\nYou know the president is doing everything you can I said before the break you know his energy level is absolutely\nUnmatched I'd say that not to just be you know overly overly complementary of the leader of my party but\nQuite honestly if President Trump and his ability at his age to continue to turn out these performances and the high level of energy to try to rally people for um you know congressional vote for Republicans would simply amazing you've never seen it before President Reagan didn't do this\nYou know President Bush won or Bush to didn't do this you can go back further than that\nThat nobody does this but the president is just continuing to make this worldwide are not worldwide but nationwide tour of a of rallies in order to support Republicans if they do not when I'm going to say something about President Trump there needs to be said\nBecause he was mocked for this in some circles a few weeks ago when he said that if we don't when um the house or maintain control of the house don't blame me and some people mocked importance off Trump's trying to us\nDon't blame me then some people mocked importance off Trump's trying to avoid responsibility you know when clearly if a reporter if a voter turn against Republicans are going to be a repudiation of Trump\nWhat the president meant was and I think last night as another great example of is\nThat it's not for my lack of effort don't blame me I Am going around and I am doing everything I can to rally support for people\nTo uh you continue to enact the vision the the agenda that was laid out in twenty sixteen when I ran for office I ran for office and said I Would do a B C D and all the way through dizzy\nAnd I am doing it but some of it I cannot do because of congressional obstruction and I'm doing everything I can to support that Congress and to make sure that we remove the obstructionists\nAnd that would mean the Democrats and we have to not only like I said hold on to hopefully grow if it doesn't happen if we lose that twenty three to\nTwo twenty seven or eight thirty seats or whatever it is that is the average and this is what happens in the mid term election the opposite party of who's in the White House loses that number of seats in virtually every mid term election\nIn modern American history political history this would not be a repudiation of Trump it would be a direct\nUm you know following of of of historical tradition just in terms of voter norms if he is able to book those trends if he is able to stop that that\nWave from happening it would be one of the most amazing accomplishments in modern political history but just why would he would be you would be stopping something from happening which is expected of the minority party which is to gain that number of seats if he somehow heads at off\nNot only should we be given all of the praising the world for his ability to uh to rally voters in the face of incessant negativity from the media about his own party to keep control\nBut he would be ... you know he would be bucking political history in the same way that he bucked it when he won the office of president in the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously a spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and tying it to\nThe caravan why and how quite simply because the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of that caravan [noise] he says we're going to stop it and he says we will have nothing [noise] so we will not used to stop that terrorists\nAre going to talk more about that as we continue this morning brands live in Cleveland, Ohio sitting in third grade you do as we're on the show [noise]\nYou're in the middle of non stop action packed\n[noise] she was just going right [laughter] [noise]\nThrough here whatever wise prepared

shoo shoo\n[noise]\nFox News I'm Joel NATO Turkish president aired awhile and its accusing Saudi officials are planning the murder of Sony writer Jamal can show the days before his death caravan of some Seventy two hundred and Central American migrants are reported to be making their way through Mexico\nHeaded for the U.S border President Trump suggesting there are terrorists among them White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders telling Fox News the administration's ads for Mexico was held\nTheir president calling on them to step up and continue to play a role here and help stopping people from a legal illegally flooding into our country\nAt a rally in Nevada aimed at getting out Democrats to vote former President Obama taking aim at President Trump's get tough policies on immigration there's nothing [noise]\nBut now that we have literally evidence of foreign born individuals people from a foreign country trying to impact in American election by way of illegal immigrants\nAllowed to vote illegal voting suddenly they're silent on the issue that doesn't matter that's okay so the president to getting that message out there last night and also [noise]\nThe message out there last night and also talking about I'm speaking of our our relationship around the world look what the Democrats continue to push for an advocate for open borders and essentially that is what they have done is they are calling for open borders we see it and we hear all of the time\nOr they're arguing that these people should be allowed to come to the United states because we are in it should've been a grandson humanitarian this and then when it says we humanitarian concerns or be or the you know the model on the statue of liberty and so on and so forth\nUh they they simply won't open borders they want people to be able to come and go to the United states as they pleased turning it into a world\nUm nation a global nation as opposed to one with sovereignty one that must be protected\nThe president stated something last night that is not going to play well with the people who hate him but the good news is these people already have him so it doesn't matter what they say when he says this cut Thirteen\n[noise] gotta we gotta I Want to do it fast and you know what's happening right now as\nA large group of people they caught a caravan [noise]\nYou know the Democrats something to do with it and I think we are seeing how bad how pathetic it is\nThey made a mistake so that is an assault on our [noise]\n\nCaravan very bad very bad [noise] and we can't let that happen to our country and it's not\n[noise] so the president went on to say that he is a nationalist he is not a global as we missed that part in that clip but he says he is a national is not a global as global is of course are concerned with the worldwide a care of people around the world as opposed to\nCaring for the people that you were voted to support and voted to ah to represent\nPresident made that very clear by the way very early on his presidency saying I wasn't voted president of the world as well as the president of the United states\nAnd that's what I'm supposed to do is represent the interests of the people of the United states rather than the global ... agenda advance by the likes of rock Obama here's a hundred percent correct in that now as it pertains to stopping that caravan this was very important I Want to make sure you understand it\nAnd I know because you're a human's Hugh Hewitt audience the Hugh Hewitt listener you already know this because you're intelligent or about the I in a the immigration and nationality act\nOr from Nineteen fifty two section to twelve F it is one of the most important\nA congressional powers granted to the executive of the country this wasn't written for Donald Trump this was written for the president whoever it may be was done in Nineteen fifty to the president has vowed\nTo send us many troops as necessary to the border to keep this caravan of migrants and they're not migrants\nTheir invaders marching under a foreign flag trying to cross the southern border eventually marching under that foreign flag and demanding access to the United states that they do not deserve and the president says he will send as many troops is necessary to the border\nHe is one hundred percent correct in doing this by way of two twelve F of immigration and nationality act of Nineteen fifty two\nThat means he doesn't need Congress he doesn't need a judge to sign off on this the president can stop this caravan in its tracks\nUsing military if need be because of the powers given in by the Congress quote this is to twelve F quote whenever the president signs that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United states\nWould be detrimental to the interests of the United states\nHe made by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary\nSuspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or none immigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions\nHe may deem inappropriate\nI Want you to take that with you I Want you to share that with every one you know that language you may be familiar with again as I Know use audience knows most of this but if you don't know this take that with you and share it with every left is that you know it doesn't say Congress gets to make those decisions\nIt doesn't say a judge has to sign off on those decisions\nThis is Congress giving the executive under his own judgment the authority to make those decisions\nHimself so very very important for people understand that and we'll discuss it with David I'm rocker who will be joining us next block grants joining you live or from Cleveland, Ohio on the Hugh Hewitt show\nThank you and I want to take a moment here even though I'm voice challenged in Pittsburgh to tell everyone out there that the citizens for truth and drug pricing and joined the effort\nTo bring transparency to drug pricing

Frank Luntz he got an earful whereas like greed gouging unfair kept coming up and there are lots of questions why didn't the cost of drugs tape sky rocketing\nWhy do people in Canada forty percent less for their medication can we do why does the whole system feel rigged and there's an answer the big drug makers spend a lot of money lobbying to protect their profits over a hundred and Seventy one million bucks spent on lobbying to be exact\nAnd there's a bigger lobbying in America and politicians must answer to we the people voters and we want solutions are prescription drug affordability

issue them health care\nThe candidates on the left are talking about one thing Medicare for all what does that mean it means your Medicare is under attack your Medicare program you and millions of senior Americans paid into\nWill be open to all Americans which is just Democrats trying once again to socialize medicine right now over Seventy Democrats have their names on a bill that would turn Medicare into a single payer system European style\nAnd a bill by Bernie Sanders has the support of one third of Senate Democrats\nIn his program kids will be enrolled at birth\nThese bills won't just change Medicare of they'll destroy it they'll create massive rationing regimes and massive tax increases to your Medicare is on the ballot this November and only you can stop it\nGo to don't touch my

immigration reform all joined us to talk about this caravan end up as well but I Want to get you and an eight hundred and five to zero one two three four specifically to answer this question\nTo what links do you believe the president of the United states should go in order to stop this caravan of thousands from coming to the United states\nUsing a bogus claim of asylum which is all they have to do is use the right language and they've all been coached to know what that languages to claim persecution based on their race race or ethnicity or their sexual orientation or whatever the case might be\nAnd then of course knowing the outrage that was expressed by the left one the last caravan came through in these people are made these claims were then held in families centers detention centers if you want to call them that\nHousing centers some parents were separated from their kid 'cause kids can't be held in the same facilities with adults and all that nonsense that we saw\nBy the way even if we didn't want to use those now we can't because there for all these people are going to be released with a simple wink and a nod saying come back soon for your\nAsylum hearing and then when they are released as we know eighty to Ninety percent of them do not come back for their hearings\nThey disappear into the ether they disappear into the continental United States not stopping in the border states they're coming up to date and coming up to Ohio is going to Pennsylvania the going throughout the north east they're going quite frankly all over the country\nAnd what are they doing when they get there we heard the man in the clip that I played previously\nThey're taking jobs they're taking jobs they're using resources there using educational resources health care resources and so on and so forth\nAnd then they're sending the money that they earned back repatriating those dollars to their families are waiting them over a are back in Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala or Mexico or wherever it is that there\nMore El Salvador Guatemala or Mexico or wherever it is that they're coming from that's what their goal is you're still to what ... do you think the president should go in order to stop\nThis are we talking a whole militarized border\nAre we talking about tanks\nOn our side\nAre we talking about soldiers in troops in guardsman locked arm in arm saying you're not coming through you're not getting to the port of entry to make your claims what should the president do because in an interview aboard air force one yesterday\nThe president made clear there is no limit the number of troops he is willing to stand at the border to stop this caravan he previously vowed to send the military as opposed to the national guard to confront this true which the un now says is over Seventy two hundred members strong it started with about a thousand\nNow it's over seven thousand it's organized\nThis isn't just you know legitimate grass roots and just people are starting to walk and somebody else followed like Forrest Gump they're not just running alongside just random laying off the cuff this was an organized effort these people are funded and they're fed\nThey're given rides not all walking [noise] they're taking turns robbing trucks [noise]\nTo what links do you want the president's ago [noise]\nI Want to know how the president should

primaries for president in twenty sixteen former President Obama says campaigning for Democrats in Nevada\nIf somebody could give me an idea of what life is actually like in Honduras or I Believe it's probably every bit of what President Trump once described\nA much to the outrage of the left you know one of the blank whole countries it's third world it's impoverished we understand that but that\nNot give people in those impoverished third world countries no right\nTo just circumvent us immigration law violate our sovereignty and and pour into this country unabated it cannot happen we cannot be the world's dumping ground for all of the rest of the world's problems as it pertains to asylum this part as important as well\nAnd I and and I want people to stay on there's three basic requirements\nFor asylum first and asylum applicant must establish that he or she fears persecution in their home country second they have to prove that they would be persecuted if they go back on account of one of five protected grounds\nRace religion nationality political opinion or social group in other words a Honduran migrant or invader\nComing to the border of the United states after plowing through a Guatemala and plowing through Mexico and getting to our border they wouldn't have to say\nPlowing through Mexico and getting to our border\nThey wouldn't have to say if I go back to Honduras they're going to persecute me on the base of my race weight your hunger and on the base of my religion what religion are you that's going to be persecuted in Honduras\nMy nationality again you're Honduran my political opinion or my ... participation in a social group in third\nThe applicant must establish that it's the government of Honduras then is persecuting for said things\nNow we just heard from one of the migrant or our we've got one of the migrant caravan ah members in that piece that I played last hour from Fox and you heard what he's saying is that why you why do you want to come to the United states and you were when he said jobs we want to come to work well that's that's not fleeing persecution\nWhich means when they go to the United states port of entry they're going to lie and say I'm being persecuted when the reality is they just want to come to the United states take jobs from Americans or from illegal immigrants to the United states and then repatriate the dollars they earn for those jobs back to their country\nThat cannot happen\nThat is a violation of American sovereignty there is no two ways about it let's go to Houston Lucas look yes you're on the Hugh Hewitt show where you at the rally last night in Houston\nAs well with my father in law and my family\nSo you know where that is amazing that is fantastic can you tell me something\nCan you give me an idea and I know you can call about this but I have to ask you can you give me an idea of how many people how many thousands of people were still outside that venue [noise] uh and and could not get in bed wanted to stay and Sheeran support the president and Senator Cruz\nNumbers wise I cannot say but I Know all of downtown where shut down because no cars could drive through because of the amount of people still outside trying to get in and just trying to celebrate freedom\nThe president's ah estimate from his team was around twenty five thousand people outside the venue but your police chief down their heart Acevedo said oh maybe three thousand people\n[laughter] you know I think it was probably more like ten to Fifteen I mean all all the roads were shut down all around us\nAnd I know they they try to minimize the president's impact of the fact that they do that all the time and I know or else I mean it was a very very liberal a sheriff down there and ah I Know what he stands for but at any rate what'd you call about\nSo I mean I I'm a marine and I feel that just because of government our government says one thing doesn't mean that might be or be not that's for the people I thought for this country I don't fight to a sit back and watch our country being debated we've already made\nCertain understanding of that they're not being there not leaving on doors because the prosecution they're leaping because they want what we have\nWe fought for what we have enough they're not ready to grab a gun and fight for what they want than they can sit back and kill all we can sit back and just do it needs to get done the problem today is we don't drink a cold beer out of the death of a skull of our enemy that we've fought we don't but\nDead bodies on a wall to let people know that you don't come in here we are a great country and we're only great because we fought for it we didn't walk and someone else's country and take it\nAnd that but they're doing they're not coming here because they need help they're coming here because they want what we have we need to stand up and fight for what we had before we all lose that just because the government just because Trump or the Democrats or Republicans doesn't matter or country of one we all need to stand up together as one and fight back not sit back and just\nHope that guy that does it affect us in our little out wherever we live\nTell me this marine how do you feel when you see these people marching under a Honduran flag\nI feel like we need to take a hog ward and just go down that road just take care of 'em real quick\n[laughter] thank you for your service to our country got blessed thank you look is uh that that would offend me as a member of the United states armed forces had I served more than anything else\nWe fought for our flag and these people are marching toward invade our country not carrying our flag so showing they want to be one of us carrying the Honduran flag saying they just want to move their nation into our nation of prosperity that's a problem thought Princeton for Hugh Hewitt here on the same radio network to undermine the\nMandarin Todd dot com Bob friends
