and I thought to myself you know I'm busy I don't have time for this suggest sounded so ridiculous to me and I was ready to just delete that video and move on I was annoyed\nAnd I\nI felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just sit and watch this and I watch the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now I have for King James Bible one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country\nAnd another one is a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out late I'm On my desk\nAnd the first thing on the video sad that Isaiah eleven six have been changed now Isaiah eleven six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings uh songs Elvis sang about it\nI it is the scripture that says on the line and she'll lay down with the lamb you remember that George guys\nDo are classic for anyone out there right now if you're listening in and if you think what I'm about to say is talk of a madman turn or go on line the king James Bible dot com or Bible Gateway whatever it is and and punch up Isaiah eleven six and now it says\nNo real ...\nNo longer says the lion she'll lay down with the lamb it says the ... ...\n... ... it's in writing since I've never heard of that\nI at George when I saw that and I saw that in my Bible I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again don't take my word for it if if you're out there listening I get a horrific King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see it for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah would you would say the wolves\nAbsolutely you know taking pictures of it and it's there\nThat is what\nIt is bizarre George it's I have no actually the only explanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book\nThe only thing that I can take over this perhaps this is linked to CERN which is the large\nHadron Collider and the Swiss ranch or more gas and the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways I mean I I remember as a kid\nShe is dimensional doorways\nI mean I I remember as a kid the lion lays down with the lamb\nYeah then if you can get Tom on the air somebody to watch out for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scripture than the entire Bible and now it says all\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion least down with the lamb was just ... all over the place\nIt is still wolf ate every Bible now however a friend of mine uh he has a YouTube channel ah ah his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he\nActually found him and his YouTube channel is become one vacancy\nHe actually found something for me out of an older encyclopedia of biblical encyclopedia\nAnd he found the passage with the lion and that is the only place that you will see it as something and it will be in my new book stranger than fiction acts it everything else George says low wall\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he doesn't look at it every day for example if one day it's going to change to the wolf some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change what happened to that okay the Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name I think there will be done on earth as it is not going to happen give us a stared at him forgive us were trust passes\nAs we forgive those who to trust power against us but leaders nodded to teach them the rich me will\nBut I came into power and the

face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at a but I Do believe that it is CERN and these the wave of quantum computers that are working in concert and I think that it's earned it opens up the portal and see the way computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all the sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing the F\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh well\nThis is the Bible that are you know they make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved\nWe beat in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting is that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you ah but yeah\nI have Lord's Prayer carved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note that what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes\nOn something that is in stone or of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre things George ah do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\nYeah I think I Do I think I have a couple of watches what that\nOkay I Want you to look at the F a Roman numeral ... turned upside down to\n... what is what has happened to them\nThat this effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down out so where you would see in the five o'clock position\nYou know that would look like a a V. that's now turned upside down to where it looks like in a weird and again for anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watch isn't your clocks and ... and another ... taking photographs of this as well\nAnd people from all over the world and I think this\nAnd and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock\nOn my wall it my living room that have like metal pans for the Roman numerals and that has not been changed\n... ... you know we're going to have our ... to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill\nAnd I would love to pull people on the lion lease down with the lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's when it was and then compare it to the statistics are yeah he didn't so overwhelming people would say that it that it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just\nIt makes no sense odd\nGeorge when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this\nThat the e bay you're familiar with the DEA correct\nDrug Enforcement Administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agents and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWow why Bob see I've always thought of it is that we're gonna come back with more built in a moment on coast to coast am your phone calls when Neal

coast to coast our special guest bill being as we talk about big food the Mandela sect and your calls as well with this fall under the Mandela sect category of the actor jak collapse\nPeople thought he had died who he's dead now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to his would that be part of the Mandela sacked\nI tell you a George\nI Would venture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Polanski or the Reverend Billy Graham\nAh Nelson Mandela that's how the you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other\nUm stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are Reverend um somehow we all had it wrong and thought these people had a guy beers or girl and you know a lot of those\nFolks that died in more recent years here and ah\nThere are people swear that they remember funerals for Billy Graham and televised specials that and things of that nature and it's mind boggling and and really interesting\nThat I could say is that the devil is a master of confusion and division so we're there is confusion there is division because if I say to you\nWell George I think it used to say this or whatever and you are no no no it's always had this now we have confusion and division is going to come in and I really believe that the source of this is demonic in nature and this is a ... I Can't take\nThis in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that has come on the earth I've had debates\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear that none of the scriptures have been changed it only said the wolves fan all these other things that I'm an agent for the devil for saying death and\nIt it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough got its first in my life I Am an agent for God I'd go all over the country helping people to be free from demonic garbage\nBut yeah there were people die in debates against me on things like this that just that no way you know you're trusting the scriptures around and they could be further from the truth\nWhat did they say the devils greatest trick is making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYeah absolutely\nAnd it's uh I'll tell you this is where we really have to\nAnd and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying there are now at the time to really get closer to God and ask God for that are meant to know what is right and what is wrong what is true it is not who is true who is not\nBecause we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guidance of God and the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here in the things that are coming\nIt's actually kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and and we swear up and down that they can be\nYeah it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and more\nPeople are free to believe what they want it's not my job to try and put somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God\nAs a matter of God to speak truth and when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel that I have an obligation to people that tell the truth and as disturbing as there is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepare for this\nLet's start with the bones Joe truck driving in Indiana they're going to start an age oh go ahead\nGeorge good thank you this way though of that stuff is free it is Ricky in Italy is the guy I remembered my self I don't know it's\nAll in my mind on a bus or the hearts of alcohol affect those I think it's an act in the actual like cereal world to fight movie was about the famous movie line some change from here in Denver some online\nAnd like scripture and stuff like that but like there's a ... there's a trade over close to my house there the other like the family or any of the people that live there very much for being there and all of a sudden there's this fact kidding\n[laughter] that's funny\nOh that is kind of the things are there so I I just wanted to opt out of there are\nAlready thinking would that be part of a Mandela Effect where everybody doesn't even recognize the tree and it there\nEven recognize the tree and it's their\nGeorge there are people that are reporting stuff like that that they're seeing a you know things that were never there before there are they are seeing I'll give you another example for breeze you know that that air freshener for breeze yes how would you spell that\nI'm a I'm just guessing but it's I would've said after E.

test its powers to disclose the path and forecast the future\nWhen he did take it I knew he was he took it he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board is but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years fast forward for years and years now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one business woman got together and came up with their own board version of it and they got it named\nAnd talk about this woman here her name as miss Helen Peters not for the\nAnd they considered her a gift Dick psychic and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool to for this device\nIt's spelled out we job they they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies are bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do that no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay\nYou don't know me I don't know you if that thing there can spell out my name is George what he thinks that but it's so lovely and sure enough in the ... came alive\nNo didn't spend a lot of his name with somebody on the planet ... where he probably would've accused him of doing something or didn't work why so\nNo you got to have your head of the plants and after that\nYeah you have to do so it's spelled it out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman miss Helen Peters not for the uh is really critical and crucial to the naming of the board and also to get a patent it and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archives\nStories and letters about her and so it it it just we were honoring her just last month in uh Denver, Colorado and they were beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was the editor in buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and\nAnd now she's going to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage and a group of people who do tours in his grave yard is called a fair amount cemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about how to get rid of all review board\nThe proper way he's old and it was to burn it and he said and she was burning you could see little sparks coming off and screams heard screams coming out of the board up\nWell okay so I have the stories right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nUm how we view the world her own fears or own desires and so I don't mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we can't even truly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect the rules to creating are manifest yet\nI was gonna say that's a story but what I Will comment on it some boards don't work very well because they might be made out of ... a night and the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... or you could have said to us at the ... society\n... could have said to us at the ... society will take them and we'll refurbished in it and sell them given to a loving home that really wants to protect us the history of heritage of these devices\nTearing what's the oldest board you recover crush\nWell for me and my oldest for the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got 'em wrapped they started started being made in Nineteen Ninety One in production minds one year after that\nStarted how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producer there and this we gee board is in the studio with me then I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong\nWhy commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors middle my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out I didn't know what was on what was off\nIt was weird and I finally told my producer Howard at the time I said I Would get this thing on the year he took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I went this is weird anyways what I didn't know what the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl in hot word game Darryl Luigi board he said at George I don't want this you try to get and so we took it as a gift I didn't know that and I'm sure I Do my show over there and work and that was fine\nUh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone\nAnd I want boy that's weird uh again not knowing that he had the ... board\nI I run into him about a week and a half later ... restaurant and I went Darryl horn am sharia heard you're not one of those in the morning when George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard do me that we gee board I got fired\nI lost my relationship I Can't get a job I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that Karen\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there then to look at yourself you know maybe ... filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning\nWell I you know do you want to blame we've I buy something that you want to make a mysterious they don't want to look at something logically first it was ironic that it'd Barry I Want to go but I have to give you that do it but I got a thing we we we ... the poor because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meanings and and visceral reaction than people we've really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say to board did it but that happens too often give it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that's the way that no no hold on his way to think about this too\nWe create a lot of things we could just had the thought and our mind that ... is scary dangerous fad and then we can draw those things to us just for the power of our mind this one power of unconscious mind and then send her on and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\nI don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the region board\nI Know it that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about what aspect of it so that it can conjure up evil spirits let's say\nI'll say that you can ... anything evil in your mind because I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil than people there's evil all over the world look around at people cod evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw the energies to withdraw the evil people too if we can have equal things happening and they are real bad evil things\nBut then the the me just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems and so I I I from my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool\nAnd away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose defined\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nI recommend it if the child wants to you that the best thing to do is to not go don't do that because they're going to want to do it and snake what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what do you what do you think about it what do you like about it what do you want to know if\nI Want to go to come through that they want they want they want kids like the stuff\nOf course some adults do too I mean look up populist go shows are and colonel investigations and I think the best thing to do is say well if it goes kept saying what's that going to defeat how's your life going to be and how the conversation I don't know where that conversation is\nGoing to go and it may go where you decide to for example I live in southern Cal you may decide to go take a child out of the queen Mary and going on one of their investigation\nSure hold on a second term will come back\nTalk more and we'll take phone calls next\nDo you have a photo that you'd think would increase to ... to

it's linked up or you don't have to worry about spelling and we're going for your coast to coast the dot com\nAs well during you had mentioned that using the board\nIs so more like a permission explain that\nWell we have the ability to\nInteract and reach into the unseen dimensions is from when we came on where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife so that for life and in between live and so I came into this world as a very young child scene spirits having imaginary playmate having positive experiences with them as well and I\nKnew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have those connections and continue him throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allows me because my allowance becomes my a gateway or becomes just the channel I used to do and I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nThat sounds we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that not to talk to being that aren't there are imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting away but this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child but now I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's myself with my inherit abilities my beliefs about the abilities my allowance of abilities to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that let me move those rounds interact with them\nHow often do you use the board\nNot as much as I used to undo it a lot of work George direct channeling uh with my voice or writing off the board more often than I mean he's the board but I use the board would say but once every two weeks we'll be twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once a month\nBut I I prefer to work with a partner at ... at the very busy travel schedule himself so when we do get together we'll do a session on my lap anywhere from three to five five enough hours\nHaving said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings\nUm and I do live shows like that like I'm doing one on Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with a tool and when I'm not you that I'm most of the time talking about writing about it or attribute of questions about it\nWhen you travel with the ... board does anybody freak out\nWell yes oh yes they do it yeah you know you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling more with me and if I don't have one with their forgot one which has happened all you've got to do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with the coin\nOf the rest of the several hours on the fly by so let's get some calls in for your Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program I N G\nI think he's like taking my call\nWe keep on going rate ... back when I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that that he could do out of body experiences and his family was really religious and they didn't like the things he's a practicing so they put him at a home for a while while and then if I had a we keyboard\nAnd I had but I I actually I Do he said well if if you talk to me I can leave my body and I can come visit you tell one night me and my girl power Vegas found my partner sister\nAnd after they like the bad we

the Democratic column I started out what I didn't mention Montana that's going to take a lot more\nAnd and the issue with Florida for your listeners is that the place that was destroyed was the place that was the strongest Republican votes that there'll be fifty thousand last Republicans voting because there are no places to vote to Arnold schools there is no electricity\nWe are twelve days away from the Thirteen days away from the election they don't even have only places and they've got no place to go\nTo read I was in Tampa last week and I read the governor's executive order on this anyone who wants to vote they will come and find you unless you vote by a mobile machine you got to look in just called the voter registration\nMe talk to you about um Martha Mick selling Arizona or because I think ... is not fit the serve based on what she said and Martha McSally first woman attacked pilot in combat history in America I Can't believe that's going to be close friends I just can't\nI Can't see that being any more than two points in either direction\nAnd I don't think that that one is\nIs done yet I think that that\nBy the way Martha McSally clearly has the momentum and this caravan that's making its way to the border believe me in the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out efficient adoptive border security\nThat as sad democratic challenger is very tough well known in Arizona and that one is still too close to call\nYou know what's good news there is a doozy is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the care of an eye it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nSo the public looks that goes from ... why do we have no control over our borders why is this still happening to us and they and here's what's interesting ah the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path\nTo legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants what's so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of barrier and genuine border security with the American people are saying is\nFirst fix the border then why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their um I Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nBoth actually my audience is very much beyond that my audience is pro than some pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audiences reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree people who are in the country already or not law breakers can stay but we want to double sided strong called fence with a road between it\nAnd I know my I'm Talking about this for Fifteen Years of my audience and you'll find other audiences that are harder line but my audience in a very very smart very affluent very educated very a Christian\nVery faith ... people who do not want to punish anyone now Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying about big farm in ... and you also it's also nice to know my brother worked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big for him\nI Know the good that they do the drug scene developed everybody gets that but this pricing it's crazy what should have Republicans say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if a pharmaceutical companies use to do it voluntarily\nThe public does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want Americans pay more than Canadians that if they will not let what drug prices here as they've done in in other countries than Americans should be allowed to purchase trucks under FDA supervision to nobody wants the hype\nLines the poison but Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that one change about the pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying because of the pursuit of profitability\nI remind you of conservatives do believe in the free market system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged that's what you've got in this situation\nNow secretaries are of H H hasn't been a guest on my show what you're talking about transparency and pricing that's really what the new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done Frank was\nMore than that needs to be done at least some of the public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face ... doesn't help it's actually finding a way that they will still be profitable\nBut that people will be able to afford the medications but they want competition in the marketplace they walk the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available asked the tired of all this money going to things other than research and development when they claim\nThat all the money that they're spending is going into research and development they want integrity in the system and they don't feel like they have it now\nOkay I Would like a very quick response to the bombs I Believe that the FBI when they have seven to eight or nine bombs are more new bomb thing that I report it as we speak in lower Manhattan that they'll be able to find and sending them you can't get the guy that much evidence without creating a trail unless\nIt's a hostile foreign nation using professionals which is I'm not ruled that out what do you think these bombs represent Franklin's\nI mean I think they represent what's wrong which\nWhich horribly wrong with our system right now it's horribly wrong in our country right now most of your listeners I Know that there often is hopeful for the future they work hard they play by the rules and they become successful for their families and communities but there is an ugliness in this country\nAnd we have to
