and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really light that\nMy second question would be a doubt the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ... book could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes\nUh where uh someone could take a twilight zone episode in kind of unfold and into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and to get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect of this why don't I mean that I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that a scape is tone to it\nUm but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that is actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery I'm In the early seventies\nDuring the end of the Vietnam Era he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else that they go into the gallery an escape\nThrough that so he never really said that about the ... some but I think the similar to a point can be made about the twilight zone as well\nAnd it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature film although there's been there's been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well we'll just as just as well be toilets on movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack Lemmon on one of the twilight zone\nHe started and for twilight zone yeah he actually started one with the movie um in praise of tip that's right\nYeah yeah and he was terrific jak Clinton probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone in in three of the episodes that he was he\nWas he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passage for trumpet ride wrote that one\nAnd I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director um jak called me was so good in that episode this is just\nSo good that the director actually wrote or called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep coming up [laughter] you know there any way we can make this into a two part episode he wanted to expand into an allergist because jak cotton was so good\nAnd rod said you know we just can't get on the budget we can't can't do more and a half an hour but that's\nThat's saying something when the director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm going to film whatever does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason governance are\nWell used books or wherever that present day there say why like those radios theater and they take some of the old episode and he ran for on the radio and they also incorporate read to date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when it had to do with\nA nano by eating up um oil spill in the problem that that could present and I just thought that and thank you and I think with the ... state\nCool did you know about that next\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh current radio series no there actually was a twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of of of the current one no\nDidn't write ever writes three DO in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first sales were to or where to a series called Grand Central station that air and I think on CBS um CBS network and the road you know for radio or in college\nAnd so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work\nIn Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you and it was a series of Thirteen um original radio scripts\nWhere did he end up living in Los Angeles\nA yes or well he went he lived in most and Pacific palisades where most of his a professional career and then he always went back to a if a guy in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching at the cars so we kind of gradually spent more time and it's like the later in life when\nHe got sick was it a long illness or did he go suddenly\nUm well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\n... years old ones any or something\nLike fifty yeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which was instantly knew all the\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explain to you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take of being you know artery from this here and putting it here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so new that that explains\nThe surgery and he had the surgery and the doctors thought he was successful and um by the time they were selling 'em up he had another\nAttack on the table and God and that was pretty much on\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\n... ah I get a little trivia but a ride a uh I live in central New York from Seventy period at Seventy five and I worked on a military base called Santa ... okay and it was a big\nA big arts and all that had nuclear weapons are quite a few are actually\nGoing on in their ah anyway rides home woods had bought two or three miles from that day\nAnd a little town called ... up the road by Mao and a half or two miles with a little puppy\nRoad about Mao and a half or two miles with a little post office where are you ...\nWhere I used to have a purge brokered book and that's where rod you could spend a lot when he had a a swimming pool built on its property there a couple of miles away right next to the uh bay or or that\nWe're in Arkansas and ah I used to talk to the uh [noise] a puppet master one room a purge profits\nAnd I think I heard rod Serling was very concerned once in a while and I only wish I had met him but I never did but I I think that's where he's a\nUh send it pay cut to Los Angeles who uh the uh contrived and periods a TV program and uh\nYou know he's very here already as I say you lived right on Lake ... a an ... an astronaut not far uh so yeah it could very well be and he would and he would dictate and Ithaca and and the Senate tapes out to Los Angeles to be to be transcribed\nInteresting ... what else you know about him what's that what else do you know about it much cool well\nUh when his career started to think a little bit ah he went back to that area and a car that uh I Believe it's Cornell University down there and uh he uh he buried not far from is a word from what's been a little cemetery called uh enter a lake and\nRight on Lake he must love that area\nAnd a wife or when they first got married they had their honeymoon there a on a lake a A R her or her relatives parents probably on the property and he bought it eventually\nAnd they lived there and they all went back there on a summer to uh write and relax and uh but a funny thing is you do a little radio a promotion or are people who you know in the area like extreme\nOr whatever my feet on my door\nI mean we've got a cute you'd hear of locally or\nJust to help him out of it now that China just to help 'em out\nYeah absolutely ... every ... or ... which really nice guy\nThat's no way to do it in a negative Charles how he had a heart of gold\nHe did he he really was incredibly generous with his time or he would do things like that all the time he would he would marry things for you know for free for people or people at the college are more local businesses as Steve mentioned and yeah he would actually do and and you know going through his\nCorrespond to see what rod Serling kept everything he ever ever said every letter he ever wrote he kept and that there is still exist than you would think he responded to every single fan letter he ever received personally gotten your personal letters written the sign and everything um he took that time to do that and\nIt's really amazing that that you can't really find a somebody's having a bad word about Russia I don't know\nIf you really can't Nick we're going to take a quick break

around the world really handle working on\nYou know done a couple of are we call them certainly fast the last couple of years I'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention a people\nI'm wary of essentially had a rod Serling convention or people have come and spoken and certainly in his daughter and Jodie Serling they've both been you know been there and you know spoke about their dad and\nAnd we've watched rare films and you know had pal discussions and radio perform a description radio scripts performed I'm so we've had you know done a lot of uh a lot of things like that for the community\nAnd it's just about keeping rod in the public eye as much as possible and we're trying to at this point we're trying to really get a statue built for them and bring him in his home town he loved his home town a and that should come to come across through\nSeveral twilight zone episodes and so we're trying to get stature bill form they were trying to get a rod Serling museum in Binghamton or some of these are all things that were that were working towards\nGosh I Would love to have had them on the show Nicholas\nUh I Would love to spend five minutes with him I was five years old when he died so\nI had the chance would have been something else would agree to interview you would have been no yeah oh yeah he always was\nTo the phones we go let's go to Linda Marie in Medford,

thought up this show tonight I mean after after ... is that if it gets talking about hoarding artifacts and they're tied in together so many twilight zone episodes about hunting out all\nAbsolutely I mean I Do I've got to give credit to our executive producer Lisa lion and Tom ... of our producers for putting that together\nYeah and also make I Want to know um what was the first episode you saw\n[noise] you know that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what twilight zone episode was the first one they so I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um hitchhikers is one that I I think was definitely one of the ... one of the first ones I ever saw [laughter]\nWhatever way right\nYeah going my way and he's been held for chasing a you know chasing a driver chasing evidence just showing up on the road constantly uh on the on a road trip um that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint and for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we do you look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs that just kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know ... you know Raj brother Robert Robert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time\nAnd it was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually a consulting rod consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they didn't ever ever ever had anything to do with aviation he went to his brother or for advice on those so he actually got a technical consulting credit on on that particular episode\nNext up we're going to Bradford and the angels camp California Hi Bradford\nHey ... I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling a tail\nIt involved what they call the ... that was in a capsule um\nThat started with a guy at a bar looking kind of despondent or whatever and and uh probably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up and gave him a ... a match but\nSaid call this number and ah so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him\nThis capsule and they said but the the one the one caviar is\nYou cannot drink to get money not drink because\nHe's a message that will um it will make you very\nVery uncomfortable I'll give you a really bad stomach reacting and so ... was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it said on alcohol you know it was dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up and then if it would just you know crave the alcohol and make you really really sick 'cause it was growing\nAnd that's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I can tell you that for sure but it does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not a certain like\nThey were so many classic shows though they all had these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at a racetrack bored and you get the winning the war and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera it was called an accent is one of the\nYou know your previous caller was talking about a pointed artifacts I mean that camera was an artifact of its own you know they they have plenty of those the you know the telephone that the only ... movie was talking about that he talked to his grandmother on you know there's always those crops that are where the you know with the Gulf and sort of you know so to speak of that particular episode\nMarion Rock Hill South Carolina have their\nTheir yard was always a pleasure that counselor here so God of our Eric I Am in the ... and so for that\nMatter of fact I got to that one of my favorite story or just go out there that how 'bout that Raj serving as wrote those nasty cigarette\n[laughter] now it's unfortunate that really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never you never could quite do it\nAll the years the thing they have really allows sick or at our ... our rover paying ... a lot of them are just ...\nYou know you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the set smoking Whitney\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand it's just there was it was it was attached to him it was given constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean Martin lighting up on stage of Sammy Davis junior all those people would come out with cigarettes I mean it was it\nWas the thing sure crazy let's go next to too many well in the San Antonio Texas I menu well I Do enjoy a good morning morning to you too thanks for calling us\nA great pleasure to talk to you because a sterling really inspired me when I was young I started female and I was seven or eight you know on friday\nIt would be like a thirty and then it began seven was project to her\nAnd then on Saturday Night gallery and and fight by\nYou know that I was very very interesting and a lack of a lineup yeah those are great\nVery very interesting little heck of a lineup now\nThose are great D's for television or more in the neck\nSome some a little more yeah you know it's funny man will mentioned these are the exact shows that were on because I can tell you uh when I was watching twilight zone when I was\nMaybe ... maybe ten eleven or twelve it was I Would watch TNN this this is a school nights and I was in fourth grade or something\nI Would watch it was the odd couple at eleven o'clock the honeymoons and eleven thirty Star Trek at midnight and it's well it's on that one of them and how we would do my best to stay up to one thirty every every night to watch those shows in in order and a very often would\nYou ... in Kansas City Missouri is with us now I\nAm impressed with your memories they're fantastic all the detail you have thank you I'm Wondering if uh you can help me with a trivia when I was reading science fiction in the seventies\nThere was a short story that started out with at the end and then it had a little segment and you're rooting for somebody and it had the mental\nFor the value heating and cooling\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM Jake you in a rally in Ninety nine point nine FM Jay to sixty ...

day\nWhile my gosh I just I just had one that was from Nineteen sixty three plus Superman comic book then I said to my son to keep and I think it's worth four hundred dollars already\nOutrageous crazy yeah hockey is done in Nineteen sixty three when I Believe that sounds\nYou die in Nineteen sixty three\nWhen uh I Believe that's on Spider Man came out and that Spider Man comic books were I mean yeah on a grander more\nTime changes not long at all no time changes things though Wayne doesn't yeah it\nDoes in one of the things that made it more popular obviously if there's some good movies\nYou know I was thinking about the like seers they declared bankruptcy ... the last couple of days I and I mean here's an institution that is like to me an antique because you know hundreds of years ...\nWrites for fifty years yeah everything right\nAnd then all of a sudden bang Amazon comes along the Internet comes along and a white smoke\nYeah well you know today it's an awful lot like when I first started the car business up yeah hundred plus years ago right\nIt put everybody who is in horse business out of work that's right a lot of people lost their jobs and I thought it was the end of the world well computers are doing that today to us and it's going to take some time to adapt but it's going to make us all happier and richer and healthier\nI think so too I think so too are after the break let's talk about the antiques and ghost and some of the things that you've come across what would you say is the most bizarre thing that you would come across that we can say on the radio that you found it a house or something like that\nAh that that's a tough one um\nI mean just the meddling shrunken heads yeah real shrunken heads real shrunken head oh my God\nAnd I tell you what it had to\nOpt to I'm going to give you I Want to I Want to answer with two answers but the fake shrunken heads what they there by the way it shrunk and has worked ... fortune\nAlright really come from the islands and stuff where this was medicine to people okay this was you know part of their culture and it was it was a very small culture so these are very rare\nI Hope they did it with those who died rather than kill someone to do it\nUm I don't know I think I think about that but ah\nMy hand handle one of those years ago and you know it wasn't a monkey had it was something a little strange little are they how small are they the very small about the size of softball how do they do that I had no idea if I could answer that correctly I don't think you'd want to know me anymore what ya [laughter] that's true\nThey did they do it with a boy I Want 'em down in a different types of medicinal spirits\nAnd also little magic remember everybody as magic and our culture and all the other thing\nThat I found that [noise] I found a pre Columbian pottery all and you're going to love this this is Nathan by Native Americans and the Pueblo now the Pueblo people believe that a great race of aliens live there\nAnd those Web blows before they lived there uh-huh taught their ancestors I'm an awful lot about the world and are you aware of those those cultural yes okay I'm sure you\nWould be [laughter] um I found a pre Columbian which means it came it was made before Columbus came to the the ... world how pre Columbian figure of a a little person\nNow the the the dolls or the figures that they made their heads look just like what we consider a gray the alien grace amazing\nIt their faces look exactly like a gray with just a little bit spooky when you consider that they'd had not had the stories about grace back then\nBut that's the way all their little figures look but this one the person is actually talking on a communicator looks like wow and it's absolutely legitimate and I had somebody on my email\nThis morning or I'll say yesterday now um who is a clear voice plant person my wife found that out but um\nShe I showed her that right she said wing that is on me I have never felt more energy coming out of anything\nI think the antics of energy to especially the people\nWho know energy she said that has so much energy it actually causes\nThis was a replica of something they saw back way before the Columbus era and something\nThat the Native Americans made who saw big here that\nLooks like an alien yeah and it's actually talking now they're a bunch of these would have been found and they're they're pretty interesting alone\nAnd they all went to St psyche is actually talking on a communicator\nThat's weird I'm going to send you a picture of that you love the most ... put it up on our website but that is something else and I tell\nYou what you pulled your hands and I tell you it gives us a while\nYou can feel something new apps on any everybody has ever happened in our hands God I'd love to see that the energy industry for fourteen Ninety two for fourteen Ninety two Jesus soon China's absolutely\nNo possibility that let's say a fake or anything it's the real McCoy\nInto me and stuff you find that when that\nAnd to me they saw some creatures that look like that and they made them they depicted them\nYeah I I think this is the depiction of The Elders that taught them their culture who came down to\nBelieve that people from us the stars were there before them I Believe this is a a depiction of one of the star people\nThat could be the greatest proof we've been looking for you know what absolutely\nAll right stay with us when we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk about some of the haunted things that he stumbled

A. R. D. I have been\n\n\nAnd won't come back to coast to coast George nor you with your along with the wind medics with us as we talk about antiques and collectibles when we've got a guess too comes on a once in a while John ... who is convinced that the old artifacts\nAnd objects can be haunted that the spirits attach themselves in your career have you come across any antiques or anything else that you would think might be haunted or cook you know there's some attachment there\nI come across and almost an awful lot of pieces\nHave spirits about um [noise]\nUm we think will haunt things knowing that we often have a negative feeling yes but actually hunt things are often very positive those feelings that you get the kind of deja vu and ESP feelings\nAnd the kind of flashes that you get from law and takes are often very positive and quite frequent do matter of fact I'm often if you and all of these\nYou know it'll take you back in time with it if you let it\nGive us a in the example if you could have something to you stumbled across that might have been hunted\nWell I haven't handled a lot of things personally that have been on it but I can I can get some story that that are close to on things sure on may want to go on yeah\nYeah All right [noise] buddy of mine Craig Cobb comes to visit\nAll the way back on our way back off your phone just a little bit if you\nHear me now [noise] yeah I just jumped in my buddy Craig\n... comes to visit me he's a civil war buff\nBrings me a book called the voices of the civil war\nAnd it goes way and this is a special book it's about things that were found that the battle of Gettysburg by the way cradle isn't Gettysburg row and he says now I'm giving of this book because one of the featured items one of the featured in takes in his book is an Ambrose type ...\nShows me a picture\nFor you this this Ambrose type and an Ambrose type as a second type a photograph it's a picture of three children\nTwo boys and a girl and they're this book is three kids I mean you want to talk about you hold this thing in your hands and you kinda get up\nSo anyhow he says Wayne this is in the book and it's there's a great story about it this guy named Amos cutting confirm the hundred and fifty for the New York\nBecause apparently such a good soldier for the union they found him naked he was the only guy at Gettysburg they've found like this completely stripped of its uniforms\nAnd naked the only thing they found\nThat they could identify this man was\nThis photograph that my buddy now owns all these three children he was clutching it to his heart so true story very famous story\nAnyhow they felt so bad for this port soldier who they couldn't identify couldn't call his wife and you know get to his wife and and really the fact that they're always ... died of Gettysburg\nThey made taper Sandy the copies of this big area type and pass them around from city to city to city\nAll right ... and\nThis book ... has trouble both Craig's on camera type and\nThe paper copies that they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city actually up and not watch than a woman says\nThose are my three children while those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from since\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story that spooky enough but then Craig says Wayne let's go up and your attic and scrounge around ...\nThis is right after he gave me this book we go up the my addict I live in Eighteen forty house that has a few spoke so that's all right go up and is Sadek\nAnd there's this little room where there was furniture assembled ... bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived that you know and there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when I was purchased\nOne of the things that was left over in the house was this book ... book of photographs Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the same three children\nWe opened it up and immediately there's those three kids staring right at us we dropped the book and shrimp\n[laughter] I mean that's\nDrop the book industry [laughter]\nI mean that's what kind of coincidences at right now it's almost like that conjured up something pretty doggone spoke he\nArgues she got to be careful with what you do\nWell you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques as they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with ...\nI Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly and takes because you know he don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely true when when you do your rummaging and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um the the things that that make them look scary houses that are in\nUm [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or I died and the story was that he killed himself and uh I go through there with my buddy another buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a\nAn appraisal of this this for a for some lawyers and\nAnd and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was LSD person in the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh\nFurniture from the mission oak period nothing had been cleaned\nAnd years and he had like captured animals and skin them and made things out of them um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years\nAnd that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier so I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my body won't go up and the addict I got what's wrong with you because why there's something wrong there\nWhat are you talking about it because I saw something up there I saw it goes up there\nI said come on man we're working here right it's not time for us right like we got a lot to do\nHe would not go up in the addict by himself grown man\nWe ended up going up in the addict together finishing photography up there and went downstairs took some more photographs [noise] alright I developed I I had the photographs developed this was just actually no it was a it these were ah this is just the beginning when photographs\nWere a digital but the photographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like or like blooms every single photograph in that house\nHad these these weird or Santa none of the photographs\nBefore we went up and they add a cat that so I figured I'd still water on the lens and I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again\nNo problem just up and that strange addict enter my buddy says bats what I saw very strange\nDo you find that uh the older the object more possible that it could be haunted object\nYeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that\nAh just because there's more chance for stories to become attached to an object you know sometimes an object dies made and you know it's a table that was made back in a\nGeorge Washington's timely and when people cried when George Washington died and most of America dead does tears when on that table and that table experience that debt and and uh you know people are things into those tables and [noise]\nThank you and he's quickly has been brought to you by ... valley heating and cooling\nWere they talking about quantities eleven thirty AM cake you in a printed belly Ninety nine point nine F.

people that have just geared up they made themselves expert in a particular area\nThey went out and hunt these things found them collect that um and now they're worth millions of dollars\nGeez not hard to do\nWhy do people collect when what what what's the mood there\nWell I think people collect because um [noise] we as a species [noise] um are still have a little bit of animal calling all animals collect on day\nOne and we're in war you know\nWe are just send in some far above all along species on earth habitats and\nYou know we all love to collect and collecting is fine I I always

money\nWhen I'm On a picture of like George Patton or something like that one would that be worth\nA lot of money because George Patton was such an interesting fellow George Patton was you know they made a great movie about him and uh you know he he was just he was just a guy who stood out I'd love to have is a girl Adel ...\nOh my gosh that would be worth something I wouldn't it wouldn't that be
