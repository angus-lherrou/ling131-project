really directly related to that type of shooting that happened today\nAnd I just decided instead to ah up to give you a thought that I wanted to pass along with all sincerity\nI ... I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game uh whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost\nWhether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler the wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood

true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories are cold and why\nI treat the subject of murder personally\nThe woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass bell was the first cousin to my grandmother\nAnd a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her even though I never met her she was gone years before I was bored\nMy dissertation at Arizona State on the line between solid crime journalism and the multi platform genre we called true crime was designed to

the book and then I got the call like four days and I know he's got to go like uh the book isn't so they had they had the overnight me a book and I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time\nSo I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax that I Do not want to miss witness true story of the the ah the America's\nMost elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your ear coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nHow about a quarter and my daughter read daughter or my daughter she said she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a ticket that out and then ... and say that but I worked out well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say\nI'm a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it\nAnd the fact that you very likely cracked this case is very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last sacred thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[noise] I Would add to capitalize five and I would have been a torture to keep all the way I have to be going well over here\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] well I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the Baucus wrangler along with hundreds of other crime cases in a book I wrote\nMaybe six or seven years ago called popular crime by what I did um uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I have an emphasis in the box and stronger case and publish some theory about it with me right or wrong who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I mean I may revisited I 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the mentioned the train is a story it does it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said\nIs is there any story too old to be told or when it comes to you know re telling a story about a murder and she said absolutely not she said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one\nThat either been incorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also it's true for all the time that there'll be there'll be somebody who's falsely accused\nSometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train\nA series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey drive their tip while they're there for people who are actually ... executed for crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to them I Would go so far to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train\nOr a local person was executed not an ally of\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they are but there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob who when I was for crimes that were almost certainly commanded by Matt from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight but last that we are pretty sure that ... well although there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has er here marks but we can't say that it's half\nSo I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... Illinois I saw the town where a home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nI'm ... and ... the mayor in around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nI'm was murdered alone with his wife in their home in a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah and it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing\nWhere I get it and and the the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them\nUm but and when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\nIt is possible we have we have shown that we did not find every crime that he committed with just one we found those\nWhich there were enough signature\nA terrific segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that their best to him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes that are weaker than not have enough information about it but that that's a new\nUh we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and Iraq and scratching because I'm writing down\nWhen I heard about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody\nBut it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong or you know forgive me but it's worth a poke anyway so how many people do we think we're murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason but it you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we put the murders and buckets by there's a hundred percent bucket that is crimes were ... Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket bucket right\nAnd then we go up and numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that\nWas a criminal and murdered over the tunnel I came up with a hundred and one\nThat actually include the people who were murderer were executed by the state law for crimes they committed and the the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by Lynch mob for crimes that he either they commit or it may have provided\nSome germs are the actual murders at his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims rich guy who cooks right All right so ... ... ... it gets through a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late\nNineteen century early twentieth century what what is this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long but this could be a long answer I'm not along with the person who's going to be a long trip because there are a lot of things the tie them together\nThe crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight a family is murder most often our family including a young girl\nIs murdered without any warning and with no known enemies\nThey live usually in a small town too small to have a police department they live near the intersection of two railroad tracks the I'm a very often bodies are moved there killing with Iraq\nThey actually is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and they act as a ban on that the scene of the crime\nOr handlers washed her finger prime houses locked up tied to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that your cat fan at all the doors are all off the or or\nSomething is jammed in the door and [noise] ah the dog and remove bodies post mortem so pleased when they broke and what crime they\nAre a huge blood stain in one room and then the ... on the body and another on the um [noise]\nWell let me cause you let me pause you right there and we'll be back for\nThe rest of the similarities between these stories demand from the tree and you're just learning about America's most elusive serial killer that you've never heard of them next ... damn listening in on\nLike that they um they uh the crime you normally Kurt on Sunday night so you're on the weekends\nUp until my ... and the crimes almost all occurred in areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one of the primary understood as those logging Nora's doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that\nThey um there's always clear here graphic pattern and murderous if want to cars this hour or if I'm going back to curse just north of Oregon so that that would be a a link between them\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would\nAttack our lap from inside the house term they wear white out low courteous gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a lap and set it on or usually under a table and carried a lap around with him if he committed the murder\nAnd the other thing is that he would put blankets over the head of a white person and a half a second before you're 'cause I had with Iraq are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blog from flying back and heading heading him as he was\nOrdering someone there are quite a detail pattern\nThe uh the coup quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nA very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where the murder happened it's not that the\nTone that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new era and that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin there was a it was in St for that matter Michigan just run the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them pilot or another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he may have ... as far as crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plant that probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to play through a cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer\nAt Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I knew I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on a secret there because it has done in and say quit the facts about at our never fully known\nAnd are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be the worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim\nTo that disgusting title than the this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just kept document all the crimes to be attributed to really anybody [noise]\nYeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it then they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without homes much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims Sprite or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called\nAny we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this it in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin I'm so close to ... you know finishing I was reading all afternoon seriously but then there was a couple of good football game time I got distracted at dinner so\nThe ... but this guy he nobody in the president does him for us to just assume that there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks\nNow because there was a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which is\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWell from Eighteen Ninety eight nine ten eleven nothing at all the and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage\nAnd because that's true information had very little information out of this guy had little ability the spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve of the national wire services were were organized at a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or\nOr the other a wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he'd been killing people for about twelve years and the October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening\nSo when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is Pam and this is the latest crime and the\nParable series that's been going on by for the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even aware and logically they should have that\nEven though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia in West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states and all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they are the first crime was was harmed on the shoulders of a man our little it was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the insurgency of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was a new national\nUh investigative bodies of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces us all into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime quite a long time ... I'm\n... I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective address additional system was\nJust a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how ... the the investigative process that's war at the time of these crimes\nAnd what the man from the train did was to exploit the peculiar weaknesses of of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture\nThey uh they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered that was no no way really to to connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it\nBut if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all I took them two weeks to get their boots on but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... and ... this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this a little bit in in the I'm In a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that the the ...\nDidn't happen in my family in that ... the\n... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is new do each it's not science looking all these crazy things they're talking about we know none of these things are true now of course you look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they had to see a sign in Sacramento expecting\nThe forensics to be presented to them like it is on a TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they ... they they were resistant to it\nWild and there was this because they didn't grow up with it\nThe ah ah when in Eighteen Ninety eight at the time in the bathroom transfer murder\nA fingerprint or I Know him from a forensic standpoint uh it had been known since the ancient world but that by and have been known by some people that the rich patterns on your fingers were unique and people and uh in ancient Egypt even with the over there a letter with putting their from ...\nThe authorized like Kennedy twenty Eighteen\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM cage you in a ... valley in Ninety nine point nine F.

front of him or with no gun or to no form of protection\nHolding matches in front of a in front of his um self going from room to room finding bodies the eight dead bodies in the house and in my log house in a small quiet mid western town the um\n[noise] uh and all of them hit and they had with an axe\nThe access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl the man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the little girl\nFor a time he was interested in little rover off the ... the little girl was usually found in a in an attitude suggesting that she had been\nA she had been outraged after death they I'm\nA ... in any case the crime was not there was a great uproar is you can imagine what the crime was not solve\nA two years later a con man named Dan Walker some came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime by keeping people angry\nAnd you can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry a ... and he did that by accusing or a very prominent local set of them Frank gallons of finance the crime there isn't any cats in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it\nBut this campaign to prosecute crackdowns divided pulled us go in a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones a dead end or didn't do it\nFor several years uh and became a K better badly divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play where families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh\nWouldn't have anything to do with them\nBut this battle lasted in Alaska for even though a Walker San jose eventually run out of town and not paying seven pain\nThe uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it a protest and the city I Would I Would say for two effects staff that they are supposed to the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned in the piece about the ... the person in ... up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit\nFrom it and even that creates a pattern for all too often how a crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated\nYet you know it's the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case police officers working the the crime still crimes have been at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody writing a letter consenting or simply knowing somebody that\nBut it wasn't it went up to almost literally like fall in their lap\nWhich again comes back to the the power of storytelling and how ... just by keeping my telling a story to beginning middle and end of these events\nIt doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again in to reconsider again and most likely to connect again\nTo that sense of outrage about what had happened and so you know the static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the corn sensationalism\nBut it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened had they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny hadn't been what had the town done to try to come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town or afterward\nThe I'm a ... well there was I don't know that there was that ... percent about I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them [noise]\nUm for many years of Alaska authority that I Would say that it's still true today that the the chamber of commerce tribes pipes and ... was known for something else right right we are ... there is a the house for the crime occurred is\nStill standing of his operated as they kind of of more tourism\nOr it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe I'm a ... if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the the ... now and four is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial ...\nThe um uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims\nVictims were mostly poor people Muslim people without a without one and the more family was very well why\nThey are and the the community uh thought well I was on my end the vigorous efforts to solve the crime war are kind of memorial to them or by that I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers or there's an effort to try to so it doesn't enough to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economic speech that explains everything you know that\nThat's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of it's done is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps and trains crime so it was a double murder and Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and then joining houses the uh uh but if you if you go to that community where that happened now the people that area's still remember it\nStill they they could tell yeah oh that's that house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many places many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally and absolutely forgotten but in some of the ... still quite well remember [noise]\nSo I wanted you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because\nIt was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how do you think you live narrowed down ... such ... so let's let's go let's go through that process Ninety victims [noise]\nStarting in the late Nineteen century going up to the early twentieth century of one men the men and the train [noise] does he have a name [noise]\nNext one coast to coast am listening in on it [noise]\nOr you looked at these are you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\n... or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to how many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last very long because there wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe ... let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually you know narrowed down to a name to a person\nI've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example for us\nAnd including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to try to find you know will this sailor when from this poor to that port in in each one of these ports there was a murder\nSo it's it it just ... but you have to have to START I mean it it's not quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe um\nYou know to to look at it broadly your ear you don't even know what you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't\nYou know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\nWhen the intervention moved Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read probably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or jak forever was that guy or exactly they are and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books\nUm the uh uh because I don't I don't have much confidence that you can actually do that\nAnd to me Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are silly they um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument about who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas\nAnd Rachel says she didn't expect to find them but I didn't see 'em a lot when we walk the crime backward a there is a crime in Massachusetts in Nineteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment you saw that you knew it was him\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy wouldn't make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was the uh\nUh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say ...\nIs is just it's beyond anything that you would you would a\nSuspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYeah please do to that you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nReally matter you know we will go through the coincidence or go through the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were sort of publicly lake where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to\nBe investigating him I thought this is the same guy that crime a month ago down\nSouth for the I'm a ... that criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine and Nineteen oh two in which the\nCriminals there were there were a pair of boots crabs that were central to the trial or again size six feet there was a very uh the the show when we know that this is a small man\nWell it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet not speculation he did we know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the or\nA ... and in other places when he swung the acts\nThe ceiling with very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe\nOver his head he just barely grazed the ceiling if a person of normal sized person of a if a person a large man could not swing it acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling\nBecause of that it was believed that he had to be small it was five foot for the uh\nUh it was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you couldn't see clearly whether it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right have a that's a pretty easy\nIt's basically left handed or to basically right hand that's a pretty easy thing to see it was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed the man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWhen we had said that he had to be a lot of the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area [noise] we had said that he must work as a longer because\nAll of the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him or her stories about him specifically say\nThat he was an experience longer\nThe ah ah the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the a ... girl\nA that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill them out of the house first and the a\nAnd ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime they he always used the wrong side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a ... but it was\nAlways his intention to use the blind side of the acts and the spurs crime blood side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that\nThe um so the crime just matches up on too many points for you to think that this isn't him [noise]\nSilly you started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile ... longer ax murderer or ... ... ... ... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed the first crime he it was obvious so he ... who ... what do you credit for his crime was obvious who had committed it 'cause he was living with the family with that the common thing that cereal murders crime he often kills people\nTo home and he was his directly connected and can be tied to kill the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and I would say they were looking for\nIs just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal having to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a ... ... the man on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their was Paul Miller the weather that we could actually he wasn't even a German immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found no I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which you had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety\nThe I'm a probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country I'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nIt was like it in there and walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh uh\nUh they they have been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found a ship within which came with came into the country\nDo the sailors gate in reference to lack of nutrition for the bullet goodness\nNo it's a if you're on a ship it must taken a cruise sometimes I've read on the ship\nRocks from side to side and when you know you you walk from side to side for a day or two before you start walking oh interesting if you're a sailor for years and years then you never get over it you know we always walked inside rocks from side to side issue\nI never knew that um and so the ... did you ever heard of some called fractal theory\nWere then talk of the ... eleven thirty AM cakes you in a press your belly and on Ninety nine point nine F.

they know all of that\nSays he's not not even sure that they know all of the people that this man Paul Miller a could've killed starting in Eighteen Ninety eight until he was willing to lead stopped\nUm but what we have is we have a name and we have a description curious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like it did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next\nOn coast to coast am this is Ian but [noise]\nThe natural habitats for the dollar movie come out being creepy to small sticks to smile and this guy is always more can

perhaps kind of nice ... on Lincoln we didn't have found some really goes down nearly ...\nWas you know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nFingerprint evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had an ... when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and Nineteen than it was very common for people to have an ax no yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah\nThat's why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties and sixties and we have an accent what bottle outside our house and I I\nChopped a lot of work with him to a burning out\nYou know my dad till the similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house like we we did a lot of woods jumping then for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in Tom Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller lying for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating\nI was an English teacher and naturally I lean pretty heavily out in this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest village feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between all his vision you wrote about and that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat where ironically the berries and acts and his wife head\nRight that's the way he describes it and and when it leaves calm he he's not going to be caught so you know he will he at wall but the cat up and down to the law and ah you know we tried to get them into the basement and said look how how the law was but he always cried the given away\nThe on a minor way while doing research on the crime book I happened to find a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six\nA which is apparently the original story from which the cast of ... among the autos\n'cause they they are a poll also of course with a with a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know\nThe uh anyway the answer is no ... is the absolute Lee was not trying to get caught in ... many many many serial murderers are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it\nBut that that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual a aversion to being ...\nHe ... he was in the ... the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent and very well thought out evasive action not ever going to be caught one reason he never cook anything from a crime scene\nEven the you know if there was a hundred dollar sitting on a shelf there\nThey wouldn't take it because he knew very well\nThat if he was caught playing a crime scene of playing the same with or something that could be tied to that scene he got a lot of people were executed for that\nThe uh so no he was he was very quite unusual extent you have a a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint [laughter] right there I think the guy who didn't have any money that that uh that shows some discipline on ... to marine who's in Athens, Georgia on coast to coast for a Bill James Marie\nHi Ian can kill 'em well I've kind because I was kind of curious the first of all you got your out talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were in fact the gambler happening\nMy brother and I we were in fact a gamer happened it was after the civil war in our family um and they have is my great our main tact grandfather that was he was killed when an act and the fact that his wife and maybe than that\nBut it ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he was right out and I feel like I guess they hope that field workers would be blamed for but anyway we were invested in that and then my brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail for Tehran I got\nAbout two years ago by now so if there is now a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering you mentioned earlier about a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and a partner in that way you believe that my brother he um\nHe maybe\nHe was so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out about a person get few\nUm you know where they're from\nBut I'm Wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean here because every little detail anything to me now and when and\nWhere they were just it seems to perfect for the first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you I'm very sorry about go up to meet you and and uh I Wish there was anything to help that would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't\nI mean I I think as I said in our case we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime they are but I I it's not something you can\nAnd we if we could ritual and I were to sit out the salt and other series of crimes like this we wouldn't they wouldn't happen for us it's because he wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we were doing\nIt was just the way the crime set up that way the story set up that broke forth\nAnd so certainly but the Murray let's go to my uh ... in New York uh for a Bill James on Tuesday um\nYeah it's got in the morning dental men and women to have like to see on your back and it's adult massive where it's a good luck with that Web looking forward to it\nBut I have a two part question with some comment and outlets then over the uh well it's not to add New York it's it's over the Internet first thought is now we have that she would already faces at at hand\nOr people at the FBI or sit profile LA's so I like it no ... if you put this in a more modern contacts how a set to uh FBI profile of Mike Mike ... guy out\nLike Florida also I'd like to hear more about it and whether we tend to book entitled to somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who found up by not even one child like that name Lynch\nAnd the last part is a I mentioned about the state at least at this time at that time that the ... century that fill out a I'm\nA at I recently read a book by you know ...\nIt's called how I became why this is on Jacksonian Arab pre civil war\nAnd he actually tried to police besides the fact that you know they had like two hours look and say see we get to\nBlack folk stay off this but then as basically kind of painting gang basically gangs wouldn't volunteer fire department\nHead can eating spite thin and ... and and I like Scott and that with you know you're with a gang that came up as as that that's fun to finally said I'll mention over over the Internet thank you so much for\nYour for your most intelligent questions you know I'm somewhat familiar with the\nFirehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war because they are I wrote about them in the book popular crime or they were in a there was a woman this gets back to pose there there was a woman named Mary Rogers\nWho was murdered in a New York and I wanted to say can facing forty five or thereabouts\nA poll poll fictionalized says the murder of Murray road Jay but the actual woman's name was very Rogers\nThe uh in the uh there was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime but it really is an odd thing that there were these\nFire houses that were really just just a a house with his family Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they they were kind of terrorizing the city\nSo yeah I I Do that that's an odd story isn't it\nThe new hang on I'm going to put opinion you're right there because we want to get back to ...\nAnd then the lynching piece which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police who's or the other questions you have a chance to answer coming up just a minute and Dennis and Dave please hang on for Bill James taking your questions and comments about\nThe story of demands from the train to the gym ... on it\n[noise]\n\nThough she left it because the question about what it is that a modern police or FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI haven't asked them do that because that would not be in my nature I mean you know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask\nThe uh uh John Douglas in modern a well known profiled are has spoken\nAnd written about Alaska or one of his observations was that ah the um well he had several observations about the ... the crime that lined up with what we believe\nFor other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean he's is on the chart of how organized as this burger this guy is unbelievably organized\nOr the or and and also

sixth victory that's what I'm focused on you and and I think that that's all I'm saying that we play this right and then and if we if we are smart about this\n'cause listen we're smarter than they are
