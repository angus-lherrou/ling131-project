uh and it will be the end of life as we know what life will carry on but what will it be like we'll talk more about that just admitted also bring you into the conversation at the bottom of the hour we'll give the numbers at the bottom of the hour the next hour we go to open lines 'cause it's friday Georgia's got the night off I'm sitting in\nAnd and I want to get back to some of those go stories that are up the coast to coast am dot com so giving you the heads up\nTo look for a story about the ghost that moves the jar you can see the video it's [noise] it's in the carousel as we call it the you know the rotating stories of the top of the fold the website it goes to goes to um to come watch that before we get\nTo open lines next door I'd love to hear your explanation for it if you think they're kind of saw you in the one\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about a about ... to about the idea of blending human physical animal life together um it's not just about splicing it's more than that we'll get to it next on coast to coast am busy and burn it [noise]\nWe got a great feeling or a carnival or in their house one\nOf those botanical but it's so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue\nI I live in a light bulb went on and I started to research on the tree rings yeah it's wonderful is bringing him back in ... years now\nHow did you did you take a liquid did you take the cat\nGoing are capsules like it made me feel so much better\nSoon after you began taking the council you kind of felt this was going to be a good thing\nFor me I can tell you one thing for product war and not only works in one way or the whole bunch of different ways energy and it gives me like allergies carry out\nThey the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've tried to have achieved to\nA level of success with monkeys and so now embolden by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says he I come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig\nAnd there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're at once again you know rumor I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that a ... a sure the what was his name Jobbik right or\nSomething like that and um everybody ... oh my God way way putting that much mechanical hard in a human being and the you know was in South Africa\nRight and you are ... and ... and\n... and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on um where even getting past a mechanical hearts hey by the way in a you talk about things that give me some pause here's one\nThere are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but okay there you are\nNo you're right that the minute University of Minnesota is a monster for ... and you had a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just I don't know why this gives me an uncle but\nAnyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called come era's shape human and pick human ... so these are\nCreatures whose DNA has been in it together using human DNA and she'd be in a or human DNA pick DNA and they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human heart for the purpose of you know\nTransplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because his kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question\nToo much human DNA to little human DNA then you don't get the human Oregon's right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped\nInside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now because of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's interesting is that\nThese guys are doing it and by the way I quote one of the researchers it says yeah that's that's a real possibility so there's not like you know made a pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's never won funding body for biological genetic engineering so even an I. H. this kind of a very um [noise]\nYeah ah you know forward thinking of funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just pushed the pause button and decide that we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for the guard rails\nAre I'm sure I'm sure these guys are no just doing it in violation of the you know you you're probably doing it against the advice of their moms [laughter] what are you yeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... says the town over and I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas\nUsing stuff that I found on my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our how [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nAnd I don't know I Would filled balloons up with it and then send a little insects all off just to see what happens ethic on I was a little mad scientist and that yeah there you\nCreate your own space program again or will right by the by the way\nGuys with a ... you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I get it stopped doing that already go this is not play Hitler links if something safer\nMentioned LA you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game and still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know\nSo I mean the ending fifteens inning game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like singing a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you to the kind of work and so I don't know I get to it I guess it means I'm committed a lot of errors food because that's how the tone is happening right now still there's two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep an eye on it\nSo sorry to let the the island a document ... pretty scary it really is but I I still you know none of the ... the technology that people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're Siri you know what how cold is an outside I don't want to look out a window series is it snowing or\nYou know or you know Google ... by me soon you know by me more chin meet whatever in these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of assistant I kinda get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the downs of having a microphone connect\nOf having a microphone connected um and and monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's your thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely\nRight I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know there's a doll house the fancy fancy dollhouse and\nParents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out but here's the punch line and\nYou would think that the parents will have learned a lesson in like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around a lecture now are you\nTelling me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders yeah I Know\nRight it's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe there in the ... they have a they have Google and they had the Little Syria or whatever and they monitor that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our community\nAnd for the security of our country I've just had an op ed that is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so\nA saying that um the Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerability of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThat kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher everything that's going to\nAll the smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than eight billion\nInternet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book and the Chinese or the this as an opportunity to ... to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nYou talk about the show anything in\nWhether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered\nI I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered and the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and\nHow he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife and the basement and we started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nHang onto the thought because we need to hear the end of that coming up after this break then we'll give the numbers and everybody can join the mystery\nThe end of life as we know it might go deal in next on coast to coast am in for George Nouri this was he in front of\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a face woman wearing a ... with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ... and they found out that they they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology out at the husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are buying on every aspects of our ally that can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are\nWhat your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix said that they they download what you're watching when for how long I mean\nThere ... this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've been edited it on ourselves than we are blind these gadgets\nYeah and I like a lot of them I mean I I wear an apple watched by the way they use that as a plot device that thing about the fitbit in a ... a law and order episode last week the exact same thing they took it from the real life\nOh they do maybe they are they always do know rich from today's headlines so but that's where I mean I think that\nBut that's where I mean I think that they like to catch a killer is one thing when people listen to your good they got a killer because he did but\nThe hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection systems\nWhich accidentally convictions somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having those humongous database of face prince\nRunning of that they don't you cover in\nThe ... yeah and and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy re runs with\nWhich raises the possibility that you and I can have the FBI knocking on our door is because they think we committed a crime based on their database but the facial recognition technology that they're using\nTo id and could finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way\nResearchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent and so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know that let you go to Keith who's in Virginia on coast to coast am keys\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly good a knife on my phone turned back up to go and you know the question from Michael\nYes Michael and I was speaking about the ah Jarvis card I have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his ferried experience\nAnd service even as a whistle blower this call them coast to coast and before but uh it's been great to have them on to tell a story about a lot of things\n[noise] um one of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a a heart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson a worked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a car was at the University of Utah and some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as hey heart surgeon had\nUm paranormal experiences wanted which was a where he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before\nAnd he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's ... or whatever it was clear right in his mind that the surgery a from most instructions said he was able to see in his mind\nAnd later I got to\nGet you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so if you want to hang on for an open line called that sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm looking at her wrestling now from by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to the cause I knew there were two of our time is pressures in I open lines is where that kind of belongs\nSo let me go to a treaty who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracey\n[noise] yeah I Hope I got one question for you here where ... where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we those are good question I mean are we playing God yet and when do we play God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and ah you know I call a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have discovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome while this\nBiologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book\nAnd ... and it's a very telling quote and I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know ... I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're\nToying with something we don't know squat about and and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your your your picking imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you can add Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one thinker and that\nCan really within right now but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or aren't we would we cure a disease\nTo diseases natural ... God made it natural near earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular place phrase\nRightly that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the country as it doesn't really in companies all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it was really a matter of playing God I I think it's true with the ... thing I think that you didn't do a very weird area though\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing ... so ... what I like to do is look I when I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire oh totally\nWas I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I had to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the Saudi Arabian oil company he knew way through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of trace this question is\nI see as their I see as navigating a mine field and you know so far we've been able to avoid to a stepping on that one mine that's going to do it in but as we progress with some of the stuff that is\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous never mind the great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine I if I say all it takes for us to do with the step on that one mind that one hit and mine and it's just going to blow us up\nOkay remains to be thing I think that will be the end if it comes that way but no I haven't in\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics let me just give you\nWhat I think is a better metaphor though for for a science in is is we had to get you had you know let's say that the goal is the other side of that minefield\nWell you just simply going to have to say there are going to be X number of scientists are going to have to run through that minefield and ... but no scientist run through that minefield the goal will be achieved [noise]\nYou know the there will be some casualties along the way as their inevitably are\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM Jake you in a brigade rally in Ninety nine point nine of them have to speak to me oh you [noise]\nFox News I'm Carmen Roberts games or in the

Mohamed was and it was a famous religious leader\nHey garbage in garbage out buddy\nYup but they're interesting things that I hadn't heard that about a Alaskan Alexis but and that's how they programmed her to to say that\nOf course wrong and and not accurate I'm not just wrong but historically there was obviously and I think even people who are atheists who studied this subject come to the conclusion by and large\nThat he was a historical figure a as was Mohammed but that that's crazy and I hope they fixed that I that sounds like a minute with Silicon Valley though doesn't it\nUh let me go to um marry who's in New Jersey and goes to goes day yeah Mary\nHow are you can I I'm from bacteria I guess I'm I don't know if people get the cutting edge I possibly get that well that's a great question the ghost in the machine about like a robot tracking that's [laughter]\nI that's an interesting idea I I Would think possession you know generally we talk about possession of the soul so if it's if it's just a a machine you know complicated hammer it would have no soul that it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who say that a inanimate objects\nYou know become the uh uh the renting plates or the attach meant\nPlace for you know I'm spirits from that will are unwilling to leave an area so they become attached to a thing\nSo maybe not in sold as we would say

the\nLittle one and probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love engineers are really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they can just build something done enough and I'm All right so that brings me to oh keys from Virginia is back so she had called um when we were talking with our guest last hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have money or for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who do you you were telling your story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experience to kind is\nAlmost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely delivered where he certainly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand that and um that individual by the way and and uh thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker and smoother with everything but um somebody very topics he discussed and and that related this time of the things I wanted to read sure this\nGentleman Dr wrestling now from a also had a a here like the experience of a failure or twice in surgery in which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later many years later a isn't that to him from the spirit world and delivered a message for\nHim to give to their parents in Cairo anyway this individual by the way is the same roof I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been on a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left 'cause world renowned medical career a became\nKind of a church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three and a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age\nAnd um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and let her things and which\nAre being held by the ... Joseph Smith gave a little bit more and fight and from time to time I hear things aren't coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting in ... in Columbus link\nAbout paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian teaching a that we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph Smith revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other ... that he had a profits\nAnd he brought about a lot of new scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture\n[noise] you know and and they're going to get about thirty more seconds used to have some basically\nTo wrap it up the turtle man as one concept that he spoke about any taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by trim and maps and there's a very good Youtube video Jennifer Smith and the recovery of eternal man\nBecause a lot of those principles seem to have been lost\nBy you know the the church from the council on some of the scriptures them off that were the basis of a creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars to sort out um\nBut it's interesting and I I I Am a lot of friends ... so\nThat will be conversation over an ice tea\nAnd learn a little Jesse\nAlright Mitchell were coming up next our mid ... nice to have a more open lines homes will give you all the numbers you need it gets wherever you want to take is coming up next on goes to goes to him\nYet but that that that moving of the ... I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the sensors in the ... the ... in this little cup holder who district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost making an argument like maybe the jar was on its slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh\nBut I don't get the thing with the the pencils and the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled the guy's I'll go with that until they've got any other theory to a a back it up in the show is in Wyoming on coast to coast Michele\nHow high the and I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver I'm not getting it off\nFor ... for the first things first thing I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now frankly I guess I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you\nWhatever wondering why it's like I said that the Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away come out and explore other\nOptions and other things out there because you know I just I don't know that that's the way I have inside and I remember him hair gas Michael I'm Carson when you first got on even talking about that you know that scientific side of him and then\nThe thing that I went to LA to\nCome on and I read the Bible and now he's changed his mind on it and it's a Christian or what I was wondering and I don't know how well very strong with religious staff crock late but I'm a little bit like I ... I Wonder\nHow often when I'm driving down the road and how it can trust the authenticity at the Bible because\nYou know I have often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the the pride in the story of um you know like a [noise]\nI said here our hero type figure in line of American and staff those can be found in like prepared for the call cart snow like ... ... talk for like ... and ... you know whatever the Bible says oh you're\nTalking about that you're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels in the in the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God or ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is to just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it\nI trust the Bible because of how many true ... it has in it\n[noise] okay\nThere's a there's a difference to me\nAnd there are ... that we know to be a worse steering by right there there you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse\nYou know and and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth is the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest and bite or\nThey'll let you know story that can be found in other places we can still try something like that all their information kind of vinyl\nWell know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories\nThere are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr the other people started in like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying see were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof about that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it's do you can you do you live your life better it doesn't improve your life\nThat's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think\nUm and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day how can you think of that led to my best answer for you open it gives you something to chew on while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and on\nThat one out here to things now\nWill be a ... beard hope you're a bad man the gym and you get what you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you um I go to ah to Justin who's in Texas on cook's because Justin\nHey buddy hey\nHey yeah it's nice to be on my list that river river actually call them or have you can take it to the left everybody's on the religious aspect but uh do whatever you want to get to\nThe more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people coughing you must interview a he had with Joe Rogan and smoke doping yeah they they I think there are a little\n... yeah they they I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is a technologically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot\nPretty impactful when he said things about like a I Am a stabbing addict augmentation and stuff and uh I really thought it was a neat\nMetaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability to do these\nMassive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very near future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free you know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system would we go to school but we just take philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those but I think we need more of this I think I think I think a lot to be would be we treat escort ... yeah I think we treat philosophy is some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and ...\nSays the fine arts credit that people just take\nJust have to write because you can do it it's not that it's a dance or something you know so it's a dance at least in philosophy you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in in his technological ... solutions and big and begin sustainability\nUm uh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed or you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera\nI I think that review much more of these humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost ... some big giant slot machine says\nYes some big in the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be it slightly unstable human being these days I\nI own Venus is are you know our ... to that stuff is very intellectual always have some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after the Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly live\nIn a day or something like that won't affect stock\nWell I don't know that too because I didn't see my argument would be met ... even ... I invested in the mosque ... right I didn't end I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the ... minute interview\nThe insurance but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it\nUm and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in the making a lot of money\nAnd so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the we'll come off right I'm going to make was we'll start going and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome\nSo I'm I I think any time the head of the company like that becomes so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree with you use it to them genius\nI think he is suppose and stuff a little more on it in on public but I mean I think the thought process and everything are pretty consistent whether he was an easy read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very\nSoon future you know boy you know it was based in two thousand Nineteen you know what I mean I'm really not that this violates were mentally getting more than ... tyrannical logically advanced we have robots now and we have all that stuff this could be a thing in the next ten Fifteen Years you know no\nI Hope we don't get to the Blade Runner in the next year because it's very dark and rainy world\nIt'd be hard to bring to the man I regions nice talking with you let me go to a Michael\nIn Virginia Beach on coast to coast for open lines Michael\nWhere they talk of the quad cities eleven thirty am cake you in a press your belly and on Ninety nine point nine F.

like yeah like the way he put that\n... ... exactly right and you don't have any simpler than that\nI think that's true for everything is even true for\nYou know for journalism I honestly is I think that journalists get things wrong every day but if we get hung up on like oh got something Ron oh he said that person oh\nWe do that we miss truth of what's happening and I think that's much more important to focus on the truth of what's happening around us all the time then get you know distracted by whether or not something for the moment is in fact\nI totally agree with that oh I forgot I ask how you found that they were going but on the Adams fan like not the monsters\nOh did he say monsters and I agreed to them oh yeah no I I had a I grew up in the collection of Addams family books

well that may be a knowledgeable in this area\nBecause it's a very compelling idea that that may be that if we're if we're worried on this planet that artificial intelligence could overrun us and
