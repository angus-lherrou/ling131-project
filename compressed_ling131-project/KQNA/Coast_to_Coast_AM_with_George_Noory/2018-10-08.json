people see the ... like in the window we're running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest increase thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that\nHe was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene and gene became obsessed with this stall when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be a very successful man\nA ... had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change his infatuation with the dog I mean are you might think back when you were a kid maybe there is some point that was special to you and then there came a point when it just for the drifted away that never happened\nFor gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nSo are his room was an eventually moved to the addict at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house and the house that their abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up by new new that house was imagery one knew that I haven't read see little Robert The drawl running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nAnd I love that next time let's go to the time or in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about ... years ago it was around uh August and I spirit who crazy life um to make it to make a brief\nI was up a around like black bought some area\nMe and my friends were just hanging out of there\nAnd then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kind of swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the ... all of a sudden it's super clogged with that and there were like six to eight what looked to be\nLike jeep headlights often the distance solved enough to know that about five to ten minutes later they started heading writer at like right outta we've got to thinking about it we're at and overlooked there's no way that could have been like jeeps or anything\nAnd we started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right upon us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends ... what was that\nWhat's going on out that way Josh\n... it was it was some wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy send me a link\nIt might have been from your website or something talking about it and uh it just like connected the dots of I've been really trying to contact you know we're not trying but you know willing to talk for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it\nBaugh Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville and another tar hill and um you know right on in North Carolina ... everybody of course focuses on brown mountain or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou talked about them before Josh\nMost famous example you've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mouth and\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know which is of course are part of the Appalachian chain lead a leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where the ball the light appear\nNow I Believe that [noise]\nIf you get me if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain life dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that\nThere are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct of bunch of paranormal activity that spins off\nSo you get more ... and counter is people seeing UFOs time flip scripted all that kind of stuff but and it's raw form\nIt's almost like Maria Dan's on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare it to the Meridian of energy the flow on a human body these are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and Iraq in certain angles at certain cliff\nIt can create what similar to to ball lightening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white are just\nMerely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've

coast to coast Georgian or you with us Joshua ... the war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you were originally get started in pure normal investigating what was that one catalyst that got you in doing\nOddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um\n'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while at on both both sides of my family they've been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds\nBut there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Callaway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photograph them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they were not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later\nA clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing a lunch\nAnd they were conversing through an open window and at some point a jak said something to Claude called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready\nJak went outside and I'm here has claws magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws and a long story short my great uncle clause Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe I'm David ... involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national park these days you know the ... national park area and and what's even weirder is that you know they I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of the story and reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was he abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean\nWe don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken one month before\nAnd when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I verified the whole story with\nElderly people and historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was the big tragedy in my family ah they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that there's something very real\nThat we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of tried to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was what I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two wives\nWho for you and let's go to the final calls here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI like the earth is November ... go ahead and I was one of it will it\nWill also said yes and how they relate to how\nAlso stay in Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation there for a while I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on which of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first\nAnd this is the product of the Catholic Church coming into the pagan areas of Europe\nAnd trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWithin her own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't ... doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback\nWhich would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day and the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween\nAnd so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate the saints but just celebrate all the soles\nThe saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this and uh probably is Christmas approaches where\nYou know the a lot of the patients will go out and worshipped trees you know the evergreen quality of trees and there was there was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church has said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who are worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down and we punish them we're not going to win any friends instead let's go and sanctify the tree and and then what they are already worshipping will just sort of morph into our philosophy and so you see a similar\nUm sim credit ... sort of an attitude toward Halloween and that's why a gallon which is called Halloween by being the evening before the Halloween day\nAnd some parents were infants seven days a week two locations brisket valley and it's like staff are on line at you crazy dot

bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany a and a site of the battle the ball ...\nAnd uh he claims to have encountered a lot of weird activity there and he considers that area one of the most to haunted places in Europe he also said that ah the concentration camps are extremely haunted but out of honor and respect for those the dead there he\nRefuses to investigate he's just heard a lot of stories\nAnd uh likewise I decided to leave any stories about the concentration camps on him out of my book too\nYeah that's too emotional yeah too much really what would you say your some of the most dramatic stories that you put it in the book [noise] some of the most dramatic story I mean every chapters riveting I got to say\nOh I appreciate that the one that moved me the most I found toward the stories that happened uh\nUh in the Pacific theater and again when you're talking about World War two you're talking about a global conflicts so these\nGhost stories crop up literally everywhere yeah yeah\nA ... in Okinawa that was the one story that stood out for me a and there's a story about a group of civilians who are committed suicide or en masse right after the the American invasion of Okinawa and just to\nLike heaven's gate or something like that\nWell it wasn't exactly like that\nOr the story is uh that the Japanese military knew that ... was kind of the last\nFortress they had a ... in the Pacific if the Americans took over al ... Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians\nThat if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows what else the civilians are insulated them\nScare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did invade the ah civilians were would run off of cliffs and commit suicide and now you know that's a documented piece of history just terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories\nBut now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book is that a group of tourists were added peace museum near those cliffs\nAnd they were walking in a field near that that museum and they heard the sound of what they considered and they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams\nTo that was pretty moving for me um another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um heartbreaking and\nHe will Jima it there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were in a tunnel system a very intricate tunnel system under the island\nAnd um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about\nThat one a Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland to any\nUh he gets a knock on the door and he claims that the spirits of these are soldiers on he would Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan to this or some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting to map is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on yeah\nThat's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the goose don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over Anglin\nAlmost like the flying dutchman the ship yeah absolutely exactly people see these planes and they're really not there\nYet this is a ... and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily do they hear them too\nWell some do and some do but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise] uh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer and\nIt's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes fair about fifty planes I think if I have crashed in that area\nAnd it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been ... what they called ghost plane flaps so for example in Nineteen eighty five\nI'm a bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway\nAnd they saw this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and uh you know I think they described it as a a for prop I'm an engineer and look like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a key their current military plane or possibly a um\nMaybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something like that was what they want they thought you know\nYou write but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft disappeared in different areas throughout that region\nAnd a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two it was a I Believe I'm a somewhat a flight mechanic for the for the uh R. E. F.\nSo definitely would've known the difference between let's say a modern\nI get from like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one as I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nThe one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust to like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time warp or something right and\nThe reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning\nAnd um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were a starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a\nMake a sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Yuri\nThat what it was my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it certainly am rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handle hundreds of them were going to come back and talk more about how to World War two next hour you'll hear your questions and stories\nWill goose website is no conveniently optimize ... if you're a good sign or you can listen to live in these shoes right on your phone just lose it goes to goes to um dot com on your iPhone or Android round [noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast Mack Swain with us his website is linked up the coast to coast them dot com a couple of his other books haunted rock and roll\nGhosts of country music more hunt and rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight as well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes and strange synchronous cities Pearl Harbor is an inch or not\nIt's extremely haunted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh\nMany of the people tourists people who are interested in history go there ah we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're touring Pearl Harbor especially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a tune a mass grave\n'em and they'll tell you what a a moving experiences\nAnd again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that are have been told about that a famous area are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona I'm\nA just briefly and then ah during that time where he left the ship it was attacked and and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor\nStanding at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour is uh so that goes story has been told a quite a bit\nUm [noise] excuse me sure\nThere's also a story of of of all of one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves in the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces\nIn them into the picture is a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted by therapy and goes stories at places like the show field barracks\nAnd hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that uh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to\nThe sea cue desk which is usually inside the building\nThey now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that ah the steps the staircase itself would shake so it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble or the or the Nazi\nFans are tank leader\nHad some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four\nMhm ... what ... what does he still haunts\nWell that's probably the most interesting\nA story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially look to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and ice and our as well as some of the the axis powers and Erwin ... has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to\nYou know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a\nA architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure a long trench coat a cap on\nA looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the the graves or he's seen at the grades of some of pat and\nA general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars ... along with a few other German generals traveled on a secret trip\nTo America to visit some of the bad battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way the Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this story that a ... Honda these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any and most historians will tell you that it never have happened that\nWill tell you that it never have happened that the German generals never came here are people who believed the story say it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people and they still show up on [laughter]\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two\nTo be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay the imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked\nIn what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to visit with a ... FDR\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nHe steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill says something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so that was kind of\nLincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need the witness\nAnd I'm not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there are some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin or we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z\nIn the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's\nA lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the bigger leaders of ah the most famous leaders of World War two into these continue these haunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact ah you know the the bullet a I Believe has the story that some of the stories that I found out about that\nA war from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bowl it\n... I was halfway finished and decided to take a break laugh to lock the door of the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed the of vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous\nAnd that's how he insisted on having his or the bullet cleaned so that story probably are not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost playing flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nBack in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters and they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nYeah I actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent and as you point out\nAnd and it's based on my research in my reading about that essentially the whole modern UFO UFO era starts in World War two with some of these sightings of these strange lights and objects that the American flyers used to just call a flu fighters\nAnd what stands out about these reports for me is just the quality of the observers because most of the people who witnessed\nWe're the dog in the quad cities eleven thirty AM change you in a bread to rally in Ninety nine point nine of them have to think the ...

I'm go story is really focused on the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this on it in to their their stories like that there are stories about people getting to a I think in the\nCase of the heck I'm a airbase there's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people um the interesting thing for the when the caller reminded me that uh my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um [noise]\nUh articles uh after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of um I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as many drops that they used to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so bad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of a\nCouple more months we will be at the seventies seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor\nI guess there can't be many soldiers or seeming still left from the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenty they'd be Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these\nThese stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book cattle to that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I I think that it's done it's done its job\nBrian in

to ... am dot com logo on\n\nAnd we are back with our final segment with Matthew swing the author of haunted World War two Matthew what conclusions have you come up with assuming you have about what's happening with all these stories and the tontines\nYeah the conclusions\nThat's a that's a great question because\nI still feel I still consider myself a an open minded skeptic I'm not a cynic about this I keep open to these things\nI haven't really found anything that absolutely proves that um you know these tales of the supernatural and haunted World War two are actually supernatural or whether there's natural explanations but on the other hand I haven't walked away\nSaying that it can't you know these things can't be\nSupernatural I think they might also be supernatural so I'm Still maintaining my kind of on the fence about whether there's any conclusions about this they\nCould be very natural ... the ghosts in the spirits and the ... teams could be a very integral part of living and it's all mixed together\nRight I I mean the more you get into as a you know as a research writer and the more you get into [noise] looking at things like quantum physics and black hole and dark matter you realize\nI don't think we know as much as we think we know and I think there's a lot of territory that could be explored and who knows whether we don't find that this is all interrelated you know that's that's kind of what what keeps me keeps me going\nLet's go to the final calls now Monique insulin Californians are with us I'm Monique\nHi how are you pay a ... thinking how much

thought she we actually have an area of Maryland and mine were out a little mini white hat etiquette want it now he never heard something like that\nWith that you know actually that's kind of a fascinating a chapter that I didn't include a in World War two and maybe I should of his really some of the ghost stories around\nA you know famous people who were maybe not involved in the actual fighting of the war but were involved in the war effort and I'm thinking about actresses [laughter] I've never written anything about uh the ghosts of\nI'm Marilyn Monroe\nBut I Know that when I was researching haunted rock and roll I Believe that her name came up in one of the places where Elvis was also seen so I Know there are a lot of good stories about Marilyn Monroe and and at various sites where\nWhere she uh lived and where she performed so I I have heard of those I've never heard that story which is pretty fascinating\nI Would you love to interview the ghosts of Marilyn Monroe and find out what the heck really happen\nTo know the story she could tell home\nMy gosh you know what the ghost probably would tell all the stories too yeah I'm not going to hold back this time\nAnd all
