in the face and could lead to events that open the door for\nThe biblical times we'll get to all that in a moment just a reminder also at the top of the next hour are open lines segment begins for two

show a lot of short as posted that and many other tasty little tidbit All right let's get back into alliance of evil on the other side here on coast to coast yeah [noise]\nIt's a non ... we just won't do it and that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk pride to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam ec viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nSo NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO you know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour or because you know anyone could you know call foreign article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and but keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians\nAnd the Chinese are just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them um but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and\nMilitary exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging on so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know wards and problems with it at this point might not be well advised\nBut certainly allowing to turkey into our secrets and to our systems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea either\nNow far from it for me to do stand up for the house and shot by a given that so much of the narrative of the show the\nMurder has come from the Turks and also caught or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia hospitable do you think of anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with it\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who are the people that were in the\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night so I suppose some details will eventually come out but the clandestine type of operations from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump do he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if the show was you know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the leadership of saw him on don't know but that could be\nClearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nAnd the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world uh otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your\nYour vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal there ria Riyadh government and trying to battle the who tease them all there are so of course the Iranians\nYou know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see this what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just a North Korean some uranium but others\nI think a air to one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\n[noise] ... if you were in John bulletins position you had the president here who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how ... how do we counteract or how do we get back from the brink of of war\nI I Do believe tumbled and we'll talk onto his counterpart about uh\nYou know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in their country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was\nWas violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or\nYou know we've done a lot of in the open a so I I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know the ... was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west\nPrompt you know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just\n... was meeting with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and ... you know I Know I've talked to John Bolton before and so I I\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he a tough guy but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria I'm and we're all on a course or the Iranian the uranium for our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nYou know we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there weren't any regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become\nKind of a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the way that they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation [noise]\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know be you know the military and their diplomacy or you know to\nPromote their their sheer world view a and the autocratic world view of of the removal of and I think that you find that they're not involved with the who teased for not involved with\nAssad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um\n[noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and tear on it's going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved and you know in fueling terrorism such as Hezbollah in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with a heavy rains are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the hobbits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects and in Saudi Arabia's well here's van Morrison taking a break with the lowest stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after that\nMm\nMm\nProximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year and another seven hundred coming up this year\nA ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know [noise] you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and competitive with while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must cut five percent well we went through this quest ration period in which you're just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight to replace\nYou know with your new aircraft ground beef and cake so we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of something that Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustained the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics in artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great and it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nBut they say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning the welcome to Costco thing yeah\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the Chinese tapping our electronics for information what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nMany questions he made that possible Bob\nWhile I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles are aircraft\nOwnership sentence and so forth and we\nCould find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there was a wake up call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter and the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time uh I think it was maybe a near collision involved in and I'm\nI'm just wondering if that made it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps the only thing it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground has a you know cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that ah we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today\nAnd yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite to take down a you know Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nA lot of hard line Don intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to cause\nThe Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I really appreciate your service your patriotism and your wisdom during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel eight where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against you know our\nKey allies and against our interest in science they claim that you know the heat from the west will come upon the whole face the years of all not touch the ground\nAnd it'll destroying the ram that has the two horns you said the the ladder horn is the bigger on there comes a blast and the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last time that comes up will be destroyed and that they claim that no one will help\nAnd says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touched them around which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nA pack a ran it was you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since then as you know alliances with we're actually North Korea China and uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a conquered but he did not use anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide did not cover the whole earth ... explained to me on this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentions that he'd go down from the west will have her a has we have an eagle\nAnd those wings will be blocked in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecy saying there are a summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question Don Bob would say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIts use elsewhere even in revelation or the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know shy away from a eases cheeses and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you\nKnow what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces\nAre are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\n[noise] Susan is on the wild card lining cheese in Springfield, Massachusetts Susan good morning while can decode\nProblem where I live on\nBeing a problem where I

but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call [noise] well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were multiple attempts or another presidents\nUm I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy um but has much changed I think once\nThe United states are sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to\nEngage in\nMultilateral trade organizations and\nUh he did all those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warned against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a fist these sorts of\nUm\nGames dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and\nYou put yourself out there or you end up fighting wars on foreign lands so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption\nAnd I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an issue over but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it\nBut the United states yes they they have been involved levy talking when to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\n[noise] [laughter] ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility\nAt the United states has they do the same thing\nBut they don't reflect upon those so it was dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there was no redemption\nAt least in the United states that exists\nWe reflect we're right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call a Doug is Easter the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our either the thirty ...\nI'm well thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um\nI tried to get some time ago a there was a guest host them so to your show and ah they were talking about our climate change in a warming or\nThe ... the ocean now I'm not a a without going to go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that\nBut uh they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which uh that is factor there's measurable they can tell that\nBut I was wondering I never heard anybody take into consideration water this placement every year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be Jain a\n... a million dollar a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're thinking I'm subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs we're thinking all military about this just taking up space\nAnd uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that hasn't stopped for some time and that's also taken A L all about taking water but it's adding land and uh\nI I Would think if ah if anybody of you know of or any of the gift that you've a hat on or heard speak about this uh ever brought up the theory of water to place [noise]\n[noise] um no not that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of\nSea level rise that they're talking about isn't about you know the the the the ice melting that's in the water because you know what happens when when ice cubes melt and a glass of water doesn't overflow\nI'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been rising for a very long time or we were in that kind of a trans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age which still technically in an ice age we have ice at the north and south poles we always we haven't always had either to the north and south poles so\nIce is melting were coming out of a a a glacial period and water levels have been rising and will continue to rise and I think it's normal like water displacement I Will have someone on to talk about that thank you catch Stevens taking you're going to the break with sitting here on coast to coast more open lines when we continue to\nCut you know\nNo Richard yeah for the near death the last many days\nAnd days my AOL millions are or many and um I had an epiphany they saw something very important\nAll right what did you see I saw\nI got up for one thing I met him dead so much and I went through or damage of emotions I was listening to old news or JDs even running low fat and\nI looked at to picture the two little girls I have my wall there that can be probably saint Jude belonging do great the added rural and you look at them and I just kind of broke down and\nI've never been there many Christian the whole life and I've never been able to handle their pain like if you\nCame on home today to me and even though I never I have such a terrible lung problems and I said father and that was a picture of the other two little ones cannot suffered any more or less cannot go on\nA typical ... this was going to go on for years and decades and decades hardly reviews\nAnd I say they can't go wrong\nThat might solve the problem is I looked at the picture I couldn't believe in either of my own little days and I smiled\nAnd the father was family is not going to go on it's going to India and people just don't know that it's going to end very soon that they are they're going to be standing in place where the guys who are going to be standing Elaine sitting in their place\nAnd uh they're not going to know that just come upon them if they're not ready for me\nAnd um that's that's worth coming up my end or I'm Out I'm barely any

going on today and I really do believe that maniacs Dan I'm I don't want to use the cliche of the deep state I'm home\nUh I Would call them maniacal money pours I can tell you that on line\nBut in the ... when I called money horrors of the world they're going to bring about because they have said China and Russia too old out around of course the satellite state and they said you are going to bow down to us and you are going to expect our way you're going to accept our corporation and all of the\nArmy or there's going to be our and called me\nYesterday most American you have to when he said if

E. L. O. and wild west hero taking us into the break on coast to coast am\n\n\n\nOur ally\nYou'll see a giant halo folding over the football stadium that day a giant circle in the sky or people standing in the stands not show up at the end I'm going to stay on the commonality a halo for ... for Denver\nIt's the same game that all the three sixteen showed up from John three sixteen in the Bible people have yes we're in young\nPeople who painted the drone three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he won the BCS championship game against Oklahoma\nFor three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo showed up he had drawn three sixteen and passing three sixteen your age thirty one twenty six every ... catch even CBS carry the game of rating for the game was thirty one point six percent was I was reading again go for the game\nBut I haven't read any of the worst time of position thirty one minutes and seconds the only interception Luther down and sixteen ... through the interception of people that a white horse of the top of the stadium and the one in the ... the bronco\nJesus when you see it as a high thing in the stadium you see this guy in the clouds above it with a white horse will Jesus returns and all eight or so the clouds who has a symbol ribs revelation\nOf Jesus return on a lake or some revelation the opening kickoff miracle opening kick off because it couldn't happen but I won't tell you that 'cause they'll take too long but anyway go ahead and I I Want to get those facts out to you before my phone\nCut off to remarkable and I I remember some of that not all the details now is he not in the New York Mets a pharmacist demanding falling in baseball now like any\nYeah you know it was really interesting and baseball to this really fascinating but I mean the other is kind of like a when you see the halo you know there will be no symbol even Jesus is coming back into that and there's no doubt that the oldest in front of his were not a coincidence that there are too many even the opening kick off at the crossbar in the back of the end zone which is located near to sleep in the end zone rickety back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put itself in the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch back there is no way that can happen in ever happening again anywhere near you can go on to that but it happened in the beginning of that community knew was going to be a blessed game until\nI Want to go on and touch them one plant over time the marriage Thomas cut the eighty or passing over time just one player was over and over time he's more on Christmas pro plenty five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the getting people to three hundred and sixteen\nYears ago the again the baseball\nAnd yet he is and and he sort of continuing on and that in that realm he was on the teachers man I Believe one game and he saw someone struggling in the in the stands\nI'm not sure whether they had a grass he was getting ready to sign on ... you had a pet it epilepsy feet or something\nOr or he I thought he may be resuscitated the individual but he well he he would have\nBeen over and pray for him and the guy all of a sudden came back he got his breath and then he was choking and couldn't get his breath he was going to pass out\nAnd maybe die I don't know but he he bent over touched the guy's leg and then we did a prayer and um people were standing around lady couple of ladies spin around one of them as we thought that she had went through with her on a tweet or something or ... you know one of those tax\nThat she she may be with us the miracle ah 'cause the guy was a you know two paramedics or something there and they couldn't get to be able to breathe\nHe's an incredible individual and I think I'll\nTell you when things really interesting he he he when he played for the Mets they paid for the Mets minor league thing when he played the river dogs who are to New York Yankee team back last year around the in the gym\nHe played that team in the end they mocked him every every place they go up to bat the plague hallelujah chorus music they've shown on the scoreboard crying when he cried when he lost in Alabama\nIn a in the playoff game I guess and he also the issue of the river dogs people who'll rumored to black patches and the guy jumping over I mean I'm looking on three sixteen the bottle\nSo what happened later in the year people last like two or three of those games that I Believe but later in the year when the big thing was when they were winning three games to or whatever all of a sudden they lost the third game and the fourth game and he asked her was when it instead of them\nAnd so God remembers you though that was more and more and more important than the other thing with people in the minor league team with the river dogs that was the major league team didn't get in and you see are either so maybe there's a little thing going on there with God Knows you marked at three on three sixteen you live in the right way and it'll be for God you know I'm just saying the right\nThe cosmic courts are now in session feel great story
