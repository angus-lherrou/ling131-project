all the good stories get reported person in the tabloids\nSort of hitting that the the agents UN agencies are the ones who leak or plant crazy wild stories about the paranormal\nGive them to say the weekly world news it's kinda funny stuff but it was a true or could there be agencies government entities that tried to influence public perception of these topics monitor these subjects watch and spy\nOn those who've had experiences listen to the phones roam around mess with their heads the answer is yes\nAnd the red burn has put together a new project that pulls together far flung examples and government documents to make the case that it's true it's called top secret alien abduction files and that's what we're gonna talk about in this hour we'll be right back [noise]\n\nInto this

like oh that works for your for your\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open their file on her down skate um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact lens\nBucked the FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading his books and go into his lectures might be influenced by base combination tangle and I'm\nA number of the the contact chase I'd sort of similar approaches for example it again in the ... or you have the of the area society created by George king that was closely watched\n'em by the British a police force because I'm George King of the areas aside to very much I'm On the nuclear weapons I'm so falls were opened on them so in other words\nYou asked me have files open on the contact caves but predominantly because they have this political science\nOr in many of their claims but at the important thing is\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to is that the FBI and the other agencies were opening serve islands files on pay pal who climbed close encounters um with non human entities\nAre you in a report in the book that's coming out of the first of November um top secret alien abduction piles you report something that I had read before it's about a brief famous case a ...\n... the the this is an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance to all different level still that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional um aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio village voice\nClaim to being taken on board a UFO and\nAs you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um alien woman and I'm I'm from the kinds of ... he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nI'm with a new holiday you know it's hard to save this thing ah wishful thinking on the part of Sony unveiled a spouse\nOr you know it was a really weird aspect of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspects of the story or which place isn't entirely different slant on it until now if you read can fully Antonio spouses a report that he put together\nFor um a Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to nine to ...\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board um came down on these started to fail way it does have the same drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard base craft which you described as being sort of long rectangular\nOn and um yeah I'd like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning arrive very fast\nAnd he was making a Beijing noise\nAnd I have time to sounds not unlike a helicopter or you know the the shape they the ... the ... and the ... noise says like the classics how'd you get with a helicopter\nNow mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's story didn't get very much a publisher to say is your name was ... and he had ties to ah to say I in various other agencies\nAnd um he told a racial or you raise such a rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um they the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd that's going but it really did evolve alley call to but they talk it said um they list powers he was out to the ... lights at night\nUm they release some sort of aerosol illusion of Jenike aerosol er which incapacitated and choking on board they highly cop to and they a woman was rarely that and the power was played out\nUm but he is in a sort of an old to state wasn't sure what was going on and that was sort of an ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground and they the favorite of the story was but the agencies within governments\nThat might well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine\nHow this was the fifties or the CIA eyes and Kyle trend things like this the plan was to try and determine\nTo want to extend the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them anything that was basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um [noise] that they they the abduction and feel like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just then sat back and white hate to say how much of the story was taken and I when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was prepared named books\nIt was the case of a job well done in\n... makes you wonder you know you have several examples of these uh pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets to think that that it's something beyond just some alien presidents that there is military or government involvement\nI mean they say when it gets confusing if the you know if they're on January and I didn't have the options I many agencies fabric I take them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO angle is the ... to try and you know um\nCan go as the ... to try and you know I'm just saying how it works on paper doesn't show you know it gets really confusing when the Kobe rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling us\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's actually both because it's somebody up to change that I spoke with\nSaid that they are number of occasions that actually paying five minutes your personality it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more buffets military personnel were actually approach should be up to page quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't have some of them have basically they even if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words I was trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that were being done but in other cases there is good evidence also of um\n... they have to pay a good example of somebody um it was tied to coast to coast I'm ... I'm Greg tell me how I'm a at a period of correspondents in the Nineteen\nNineties or with up to ... who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an object hey herself\nAnd Greg told me how yeah back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of election as I wrote to each other back and forth were open and sailed back down with type\nAnd um that is completely be done you know age late without making it look like they have until I was throwing open race failed\nIt was almost Suzie whoever was doing baseball Greg I call it ... know that someone was opening their ... in other words it was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it and that went on you know a quarter Perrier\nOr Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name I was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm\nAnd I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know that there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know um which is a dangerous road to go down\nUm but in saying that I made another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many people associate them with capital ...\nI'll tell you one network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side are saved some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other\nGround to cover before then we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons\nArrived in Nineteen Seventy one\nJoined the ... the bones of members Greek for show updates and to the thing we didn't go to preschool dot com slash ... him including the lake but [noise]\nAnd I'm In abduction phenomena what other things such as being notation I think there's probably some truth to the idea that these flying they'd helicopters\nPotentially I think it's part of it organized I shouldn't that up right outside of government\nYou know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government but it's no you know the CIA or anybody that fly madly cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um\nYou know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and and most typing government don't know anything about it at all because it might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government itself you know it my pain even\nSort of bombed out to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fame Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by a five afraid to information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... abductions a goal seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there are so many cases of black helicopters\nThere's so many cases of black helicopters ... helicopters turning up near the homes for some time precariously near the homes of alien abduction ... and again kind of light with college ... entering drag\nBase might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct taste um and be able to to respond at high speed ... in the\nEvent that they have that the fabled climatic options were actually able to catch an ad abduction going ahead you know in the ... very time\nSomebody who's a tune in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens but the files that you've obtained from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously\nMaybe the scariest part of this is that there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on the other agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why does stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows\nA you know many many cases agencies came the information to themselves unless it needs to be shed and if we ... I had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to\nA private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult\nBut I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations\nI'm a wave of and cancers that are cutting Seventy five and some of the the ... of and I'm bored of the United states in in the last ... to Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and on and I think some violence and intimidation a sort of the the ... the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences are literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented cases it's tough to figure it out and it's tough to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bombs are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are new to you the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the germ ... got it coming out in December and then there was a book that's going to be published I think after the first year\nAnd a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee alien scenario\nWell yeah I mean you know it was our story there's always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you ride but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThe end you follow Jay ... you know when this story runs out of feel I Am you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know I I and I think that the big difference weightless or is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as he was he's never expanded on it if he tells us I'm ... years ago I hardly tried to put himself\nAt the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and however\nMany you know dollars and so forth it doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story eight doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nBetween the abductions\nAnd painful who claimed that in some way or another they the the grace of the aisle and grays new to the abductions but somehow they have this\nDay when sort of sinister and disturbing entrenched in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this this portion of the fifty one he was working at allegedly\nAnd um he said that was the aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um any speculated on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the grave had some sort of\nObsessively and try to stay in in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct pays who were approached by ... by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you've bought a veal salt leaving your body um\nDid you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of\nDo child wave this story that was always tell him as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd then of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project boo book they're not studying it it's no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information\nOn what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous stopping um in light of the kind of files that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance when there's counter intelligence and there's no information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelations I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner weary of this you know they use some history behind why they need to be careful [laughter]\nWell yeah I mean I think you know it it is such a confusing angle judge you know they ... they sign glove um rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um\nYou know ... ... a rainy sort of a a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAn abduction event but then at the same time also invest\nThen at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know ... it's it's not you know where um [noise] you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of rarely blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but then there's but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive\nUm survivor myself I have to face\nYeah it's it's right out of the X. files everything is great nothing black

therefore they don't\nKnow the disconnect between centuries of human experience\nAnd rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also\nPossibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile the seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time

theorist I don't know um if you are\nYour members every audience of her string theory but sure um he's me so yeah they're string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theory is that incorporate these other dimensions 'em and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern government the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem and modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seem to govern reality\nUm and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together you know we have we we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor in the ... world with the er the atomic world world of quantum\nAnd we know those equations work we know they're correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement a hum of the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and San ... and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity week we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are\nAssuming that there are additional spatial dimensions and they're using them in order to come up with a single\nSet of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nIn between sort of the Weinstein union version and the quandary version you know things like spooky action at a distance or which of scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematician who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know that they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem with having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange an uncanny on implications of\nThere's there's other strange and uncanny um implications of of quantum physics that um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and I had all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who then have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them is higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts and says X\nOr maybe we could use flat land as the illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the

species and there were a number of um there were a number of challenges I guess you'd say to Christianity\nAnd Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing the ... wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world was it was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects as objects with just length and with some of them were flat square some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this\nFlat world and of course they believe that uh they live in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when a three dimensional object\nA sphere inserts itself goes down in in in in sorts of fell into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his fight with the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object to start talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another\nAnother world and the spurs says this can't be possible and the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um extreme measure and he\nHe reaches over and pull the square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and looks down on his flat world they can for the first time the the whole world spread out in front of them\nSo the square it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back\nTo his flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this and can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... and it's forbidden it's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he's put in jail where he\nWhere he stays for a number of year years and and the story ends with this for a flat square languishing in prison I'm hoping that the his readers ... some of his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye because to their reality so he sort of like\nThe idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time yeah\nYeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interested in commenting on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England when he where he lived for I sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but uh but the square character did have these wild often and I even have the visionary experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm\nSo happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nThink about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions are might be others um that we don't see and we go through our life I'm thinking that our world is the only world you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nRole it's uh it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ... it gets pretty complicated [laughter]\nI'm like I say what we're gonna we'll take we will jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who were inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions ah the doors break on through tickets to the break\nMy dog were George Nouri speaking ... website scroll down to the model when you were just humid or\n\n\n\n\n\nHe makes he makes it move that I think not a lot of people would make it right in the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that is the way in which the map provide certainty onto him so I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of\nThinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which\nI mentioned earlier in our conversation and then he he starts to think you know what if these what if these mathematical variables and my question you know these higher higher dimensions that I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um\nYou know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he he thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he developed over way of what he thought of as a sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses I it involves um no it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know it's three by three by three\nUm and he'd and then he he memorize is the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll ah and then he'll rotate the Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions it's essentially sort of unimaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues\n... shook their heads I think ah [laughter] you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this this cue these cube set together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gotten not just one of the first\nUm um you know automated pitching devices I'm ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure prints and he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing that he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these are ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document in trades I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you've got a pretty soon mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto it you know they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\n'em as well as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nYou know their writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas or spiritual riders take up these ideas a lot of religious people and the U.S and then\nIn Europe pick up these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book and chapter seven chapter hey is\nIs cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis are learning the same famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer\nHe uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions to rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nHe incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the same ideas around there as well he's got he's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he\nHe was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist or like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes this illusion there's a number of people in there you know precisely isn't there and James Dan it and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings had been ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and\nFor some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others like like James Bennett [laughter] ah he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talked about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seem to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has a out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how math\nThe experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else so higher reality another reality [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah no dreams are fascinating and um your dreams are seem to be important in just about every culture around the world um you know and then many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the ... with a psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six [laughter]\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is a is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also the soldier and and goes into combat and the second border war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that [laughter]\nThat surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has he has predicted dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress um and the\nOf battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then you wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island he recognizes the island as as an someplace he's already been in his dreams\nHe noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's he's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something is going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French\nThey don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a slap in a panic\nA couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island of Martinique the French speaking island of Martinique\n'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think um you know how could this be how could how could in in my dream pocket I've seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to himself for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google ... W done and\nYou can go go in and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it as as the country's headed towards a World War one but he he tries to reflect on this he is puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down\nAnd then he he he comes across basically uh the like people like in ten and people who are talking about the possibility that there's\nHigher dimensions and he's reading Einstein well he's reading about Einstein's theory and sort of popular science and he he ended up developing a theory\nWe're to talk of a quandary nice living sodium cake you in a preppy ballet and on Ninety nine point nine F.

I'm incorporating shocker as into the comment um and so yeah I Do I Do talk a bit about chalk Rosen energy fields in the book you know that that's another [noise] another language that people use for\nFor spirit right and so and and spiritual energies in a in the body and so on and and people do use higher dimensional language to talk about those as well\nA wildcard Charles in Texas good morning Charles\nGood good morning a and that is definitely more you're kind of get laid off\nBut anyway my um my question is well I I Try to narrow it down as much as they could uh you know for I guess for dying I say a ... but it just really this is sort of an issue where you you can't really narrow things down this way and really we're\nGoing to narrow it down because in two minutes we're going to go to a break so\nWell anyway they I I guess I could ask this question I don't have you ever read that J. D. priest leaves on national Christopher here and if you've ever read the pre ... a sort of a big cafe on um it's called man in time it was published along with a with a lot of young books\nAs out of the wonderful book at the great buck\nYeah yeah oh how could you do you have read it will very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues I've been having has has with the I guess with businesses particularly still be attached to it gets an anthropology if there was a it never really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices they come in front of their ... says this is why fight with both uh uh toward a about time about the issue of\nTime and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how would it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality you know also the whole perception\nOr not this this time but uh I mean\nI when I look at things in a quantum level we we see that everything is everything is is a sort of waves\nAnd I mean of course people don't even have like waves are frequencies are but the time becomes very essential 'cause it gets the existence of matter [laughter] you know and our ... our our perception of it anyway so I mean they're just at any way to have any comments or thoughts about the\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come J. B. Priestley I talk about him chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions on he read him and who he talked about he reads Jadav you've done who have talked about\nUm and he comes up and did all his own theories interestingly previously like some of the other figures in the book how the combat experience he also fights in World War one every young person and as um as an of injured\nUm and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of\nFeeling like he's out of time I'm feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book he has all kinds of testimonials from people who have written they have out there pre cognitive dreams have their dreams that\nSeem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC in Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to write 'em letters if they've ever had an unusual time experience that they've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that predict the future and\nUh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience but like many of the letters are still extent that still at the University of Bradford I've been married to\nRead through all the letters and I I incorporate a number of time in my book especially\nWill be that Christopher wait we'll take a break we're talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty things in the end of the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions minimum\nDuring the ... the in the sports page with thousands of members is great for show up they didn't connecting with those are the ones who do these little dot com slash ... am including like but [noise]\n\n\n\nOn the\nIn order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um [noise]\nYeah so that that sounds similar to the kind of practice you were talking about\nWhat Marcia I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try next year that suggested the dollar [laughter] from things to the idea right eat the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I might go or\nWhat happened to me is I uh I started writing the dream journal and I I wrote a dream that my mother shows than what was that was going to give me his car and all that money so [laughter]\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show that was very strange to me that I Dreamed I wrote it down with with the data and and everything and it came true like months later [laughter]\nYeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream we'd get up you write it down right away and and um the whole journal and and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and their dreams so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard my job in Monterey, California Morning Joe\nGood a good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him and he's a what they call a super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In ... has it's drawbacks this is um he's a mental where this is a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the cool super conscious mind and you can access these high at world\nUm I Do this with my clients and are they going to a detention world for different reasons weather's healing whether it's neat a loved one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different means you out there doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is it's not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does or you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a train stayed and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it'll start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I like that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a as a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have less than\nTwenty century psychologist and call you on that and many others um you know when we talk about there being three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's going in you know it's going not going out somewhere it's going to

I'm Native American ally and um some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one where we'll cage that was from a military base not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah they saw some other British a bicycle royal Airforce how to break\nAnd uh I actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um that you are an American guy but it's working um Elvis Asia Valerie how come right in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presidents this was a high to the Cold War and he he saw that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big for type ... was it not put the five that just the the face was very difference\nTo how you're describing nights and it was\nTo hire you were describing I it's\nA it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so I feel much and sort of a big party with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise]\nYou know I didn't see any reason why should you know create a story like that will fabricated story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean it's a background in the mail a tray and he said he just wanted to share their story because they never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are report these huge dogs I mean right out of town to the ... you make that that comparison in your book as well as these\nGigantic cats and that you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal to skate from the new or maybe in somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the uh the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the dog when\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mom which kind of looks like a a dog like animal that's you know clearly is not\nWell in England or they get okay we have what I noticed find some black dogs now I'm Conan of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel to the ... he actually by his novel on a pre existing legit and\nI'm One of many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um typically a much ... much larger than regular dogs a base firing blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the elections and traditions if you would just say one of these um find some black dogs eat what are the main that you would die or a close family member or friend would die\nUm Mick unlike the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several\nUm reports of people saying the content black dogs\nIn the vicinity of stone circles in the ... not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller\nUm fall nations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses saw one of these large black dogs there and like they okay see going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and next second you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what based things all you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all eyes the spirits of\nDogs but once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nSpirit of that dogs would resemble their dogs by like in real life I'm\n... and then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cats lived there\nWell now you're right and in fact they become known as I said I Am big cats\nAnd I guess every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the u._k. now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where I'm wild animals actually have a guy from the shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there are these large black cats roaming around the K which simply by explanation because\nThe sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland needs hundreds every year\nNow for that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is a payoff flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomenon things that's the case\nYou know we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about who's the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could be the rock and roll theme song for Halloween a C.

I. L. and I'm In Wilmington Wilmington moved over here it's great to have you on board one of the things\nWe like to do is keep you up to date with all of the races across the United states because the United States Senate impacts everyone one of those races in West Virginia where the attorney general about great state pat Morsi is running against Joe mansion a Chuck Schumer supporting a Democrat and Patt Morrison joins me this morning from West Virginia morning general good to have you with us\nHey good morning you it's good to be back on your program\nAnd it's great to have you back give us a a run down and how the race fans eight days from the vote\nWell you we have a lot of momentum going into the final stretch early voting just started on October twenty four and we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm on our side as people come out to the old I said\nPeople across West Virginia were absolutely sickened by what they saw on full display in Washington this fall\nAnd they're coming out and we're feeling that we're growing in the polls we have some poll showed us tied to poll showed us up\nBut the most important thing is that we're trying to get our message out and get her vote out in the final eight days the president is coming back to West Virginia on friday just another big site for us and there's you know President Trump is very popular in West Virginia you warm with forty two\nPercent of the vote this is coming back each time these ... we've got a big boost to the polls are I think we're right there for the stretch where are we know that she worked just or rather gossip about a year and we're just after the site and keep our vantage over the next day day\nPatrick Morrisey it as my view that the desperation on the left the attempt to claim the president and it's all over everywhere this morning the president is tight submitted Kevin McCarthy and then I submitted the Republicans are responsible for violence\nThat there's not a bomb or a semi representative of Trump people I think that blows up in their hands and I don't mean the bomb I mean the rhetoric because the idea that\nThis crazed killer would be killer is somehow representative of Trump supporters or West Virginians is to me going to drive people to the pet more see a vote check what do you think\nWill look I think that's right and whenever people are seeing these Bob I think they're beginning to associate with the with the crazy what happened because people literally going nuts on the other side of the aisle\nAnd inside more and more people now is Joe mansion or to get elected again his first voters for Chuck Schumer that whole Schumer Pelosi Clinton obstruct resist impeach mob that's what it's all about and\nPeople can connect the dots now and there's more and more activity occurs where people see crazy behavior on the part of the liberal leadership and the people that are trying to gain control of the house that I think that's a very motivating factor\nMore and more I think folks are understanding but he's not West Virginia conservative values\nThey don't my record on the conservative fighter took on the Obama administration repeatedly it'll warn protecting coal fighting substance abuse at standing up for conservative values are Second Amendment and whole life\nConservative values are Second Amendment and coal lifestyle you Joe Manchin the opposite and even more importantly when he votes for sure it's a vote for the mob mentality\nNow now to finish on that point pat more as she does the average voter connect Joe mansion with Chuck Schumer because we all know what matters most is the majority in the Senate when it comes to judges\nAnd while Joe mansion may have voted for Brett Kavanaugh his party didn't they did everything they could to destroy him and he tried to stand aside from that records but to voters know that if you vote for mansion you're voting for more of the cabinet attempt to take out\nWell we just started a couple of commercials on that I think they are or are they do that at Boulder so smart they know that the craziness they saw that didn't come from the Republican side of the aisle they know that it's not always sure word polo see it's Hillary Clinton\nI mean Hillary Clinton said that they can't be civil I mean that's a quote from Hillary Clinton\nOr the people can connect that and obviously Joe mansion doubled down supported Hillary Clinton even after she said she was going to put a lot of coal miners coal companies out of work so I think they are you there bring it together because they know that\nThis side represents a complete a hundred and eighty to return to go back to the Obama era the Hillary Clinton era which they really hate it so I feel that the energy on our side we're seeing it all the surveys\nIt's growing and growing and do what Joe ... as a problem as voters up it was just going to be a big issue for\nHere it is an a long day but it will fly by good luck path more issues you spread towards the end I Believe West Virginia is one of those that can supply election night\nMust be very much mention is this your\nOf a nonstop action packed information [noise] she she was sure this coming right back [noise]\nFive year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American lives destroyed by our broken immigration

illegal immigrants and insurers only American citizens have the right to vote\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump nice\nThat's conservative God what is going

that but they really can't back it up and so it's unfortunate that we're in a situation like this now we're just gonna mudslinging each other\nNow let me talk about that I'm Talking with Anthony Scaramucci his new book Trump the blue collar president bookstores everywhere also a lower third tier on on MSNBC today again this is in\nThe people in the car runs aren't that people were talking so I Can't blame is on me courage oh it's just on their show Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans\nI have a Washington Post column today Anthony Scaramucci you cannot blame violence on anyone except the perpetrators of violence in his a ridiculous than I don't blame Bernie Sanders\nFor the Alexandria softball shooting I don't blame Maxine Waters for people chasing I'm I'm Mitch McConnell or or secretary Nielsen out of restaurants people who commit the crimes are responsible but what do you make of that lower third Trump's role in stoking violence among America\nWell listen I I again I'm In New York camp I totally disagree with that you have to finger the individual but I have said this is the president I said as recently as yesterday we had a conversation yesterday if some of my TV appearances\nWhy not try the toned down approach because you know you you're at forty seven forty eight percent of you could get yourself it in the mid fifties she's doing stole while\nOn so many different fronts I'm an ... why why have a head when you get\nUm and ... why why have their head when you can use these people um you know he's on the opinion that there's no to any of these people that they're just going to continue to come out and\nGuns blazing no matter what he does endorsed says and reference that yesterday me on the phone the speech on anti Semitism that he gave on Saturday and he said it is just kick out of that\nIn the mainstream media or and so and then I went and checked that went on that and looked around and sort of the criticism was while he was reading the prompt or he didn't really need it so it's just you know he he is right in a lot of ways you not going to get a fair shake that I feel perhaps you may feel that he deserves a as it used\nTo be whether or not that\nI played three clips of the I I played three extended clips of his Indianapolis speech denouncing anti Semitism I think it's probably the first than anyone driving to work this morning as heard them because this is where I wanted to get to the ... inside and you do\nA let's get our Harvard law school brains on here you know that the media has monetize hating Donald Trump you know that and that's a problem that's what's going on is that a couple of of cable channels have monetize hating him one is monetize loving him\nThat Anthony is bad for America it's just that I agree\nWith that well I thought I told you that I think that we see that objective standard and the business model of these companies now fragment thing to go to people that have confirmed biases that he gives a very big\nIssue you know when I go on time a obviously a pro Trump supporter of the three hundred and four page book about what I saw the campaign shorts entered the White House but how he was able to steal the base\nOf the Democratic party and I go on you know what I Would say are adversarial programming um and I just get lit up and destroyed on Twitter out and and people cry you the politics of personal destruction\nAnd the politics of dehumanization and you know you mentioned in my mother in law school degree but you know set fires was calling me like fat Tony in the White House you know and\nThat's what I don't understand your ear to the actual guys who came into the Trump Administration and nobody knows that\nI was I was a walking pinky rang according to Seth Meyers I was at a gym and laundry uh Jersey Shore cash member and so I mean it's just funny I mean you're allowed to do that to Italians are not really allowed to do that to other racial groups you know work ethic but that's fine I mean the point\nThe point I think the more important point you is that have to stop this nonsense um it's just bad for kids because the kids are out of the discourse\nAnd that they're going to put us in a position where they're uh they're no longer are involved and I think the politicians without so cynical actually lawful you like fishing\nI like Anthony before running on a ... advisor present you talk to them I think he needs to do more television with more adversarial people like to use to go on with Anderson Cooper and that's not my network\nOr they get to go on with Scarborough I think you had to go home with Matt I gotta go everywhere 'cause he never loses one on ones and they cannot not televised and but he stopped doing that during the campaign\nHe was ubiquitous on every channel it every moment totally interviews on radio what do you think\nWell you go back to my ... plan I wrote a seven page calms planned that literally said exactly what you just said I was about the apple event that plan on the thirty first of July and I got fired at nine thirty seven in the morning but had I had been able to implement that plan\nI Would have put a big dog out there in all of those situations\nAnd I think he would definitely be gravitating way more independents as a result that soil hundred percent agree with that\nYeah the scary but you go to talk to a good luck with Trump the blue collar presidents in bookstores everywhere you cannot miss a Trump the blue collar president come back soon Anthony Scaramucci let me also take a moment now\nTo tell you
