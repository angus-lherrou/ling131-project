they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them but it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\n[noise] yeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man that half of injury to it because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it\nBut a lot of people just ... sale you know it was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that when there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ended up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd they and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing it it's somebody wasn't just going to get in or when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big butt sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why wouldn't Ohio and Pennsylvania be so prominent than the numbers and it's because I mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties\nWhere the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived time\nActually and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction with a giant sightings\nAnd skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish civilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even weirder thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWhile that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year and the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter] Bruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime the fascinating guy are both in person and on the air and in his book or you know what it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of a meter and a again a surprising\nSurprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then end up ... they've there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about the present day sightings again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm\nYou know some of the the descriptions obviously I you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but Mobley the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect and uh I uh people always tell me well what about the star wars creature that looks like they could now I'm kind of strange\nThat it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it's it's a similarity um some of the descriptions I guess I Would have to leave the right here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing\nWhich suggests to me maybe they were humans may be read they really were literally wild men out there\n[noise] and usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about big for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier or if they're seen\nMaybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\n\nUm if you were to communicate with to try these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes who would say people that have a relationship one going with or whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's a famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where\nUh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spending that fact\nWhere there's this association between big for it in UFOs\nEven in the book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw big foot and the regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds and when you talk to these tribes\nOf the tribal ground and when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not what they have your trust that will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us from them and there are different kinds of tribe and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitation for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people to die hards don't like at\nThe UFO diehards uh like it even less or they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you out those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can't ignore it I thought the interest there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really unusual for years ago one of my best friend the parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my car\nSo they own a future for\nAnyone out there and talk to them and that's all I think he's ... years old this guy's dad\nAnd he looked at him and he said you know every once in a while my cat will come back from nowhere completely though and go I don't understand it [laughter] and then the same man told him he says you know\nEvery once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around get back on the horse or get back on my TV and Rowley and he does\nAnd then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property out there so I ...\nI think when you get the trust somebody a dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny story that they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're kind of particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit um\nDo they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take here or there an omnivore\nAnd many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods hurting themselves they'll come across it you're stuck up on a tree and like a two hundred and fifty pound here a native ... could have done it\nOn our way up in the tree and it's so tornado hurricane zone so how did it get their\n... big foot wild bend the giants as the book in a moment we'll open up the phone lines are with your calls and questions and comments white flag into the break your own coast to coast they\n\nI'm I feel like Rome or also at the way that we could find out more about wild land because there are Amazonian tribe network is discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like your ideas revolutionary and I feel like with them and I had years will definitely have an answer because of strong\nAnd my question is\nLike it's going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding that for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people are asking worked real well and you can't use the drone international park it's against the wall and there's a huge crime so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you could kind of touch on it for the people here\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big quake can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times uh it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers and we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers a patrol\nBut the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal grounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and uh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was\nA just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you can hear it that way I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans of your head alarms going off in the police officers chased it ah I think they've they've found some tracks it led to\nA there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared\nOr they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself I should call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin more courage and seeing\nWhat looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the off the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through the skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel\nStands up it's eight feet tall feature lists dark humanoid shaped like ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards skin Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but\nUh there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh uh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and uh\nHas seen it all over the you went to Beijing so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures are that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual\nPhenomena and we don't know um\nWest of the Rockies Kyle in Utah by Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind\nSo [noise] so I had a year and talking to David Was talking about Joseph ... Smith the one who talked the chain on his saddle um Utah they put\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five of us are Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another town logo ... then he was an awful lot of times the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran in the Cain and uh he described Cain as a as a tall a fear that was taller than a saddle\nAnd a silly topic Cain and he came to introduce it still is I Am a man I'm encouraged to launder here and there and my goal will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nYou brought that up I just thought the morning culture LDS coal ... that we have you know there's two story there really famous that story than a Joe's chili Smith who is chosen snus nephew\nKnow his brother had an encounter Leslie Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and the mentally Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one\nI came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand uh\nWesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and slowly rolls his hand and they just crashed a cash cow and came Ron it's interesting you say that we can and our church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted\nBut I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff I Do take it it's a big foot you taking like does he have any idea what's going on his like people are asking me you know like people do need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nI Will let me tell you a Kyle and everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are ... social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely the go to person in their own circles for information about these kinds of topics\nThey have to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big foot type encounter or is that something else\nWill the description that the Smith gave was ... but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nThat Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nThen the other thing like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a manner of facts all my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinion about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that there are no facts to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the ... world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nAnd I should point out that you know you did to address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible of stories in your view of big foot being responsible for we're cutting people off as far as you know\n[noise] ... no no killing them I I think all of them okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw the family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them a it's a it's a really really good story\nAnd individuals or time sign an affidavit I followed green ... this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how it came came to pass\nRemember that story now yeah that is a good one is it there are some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big foot type\nIt's about a witness claiming to see a big foot type creature carrying a person\nThrough the forest and ... you know so well there's a story out of Wyoming that I I don't\nPut much credence in it because the people didn't come forward and they were doing something illegal but a girl disappeared in Wyoming and to uh people who are poaching we're out in the woods and they claimed that they saw big for carrying this body under its arm that appear dead\nSo these people never came forward I don't know who they are a district was given to me but from another big foot researcher that it's a well well known and this guy was caused supposedly by these two guys and then he told me\nTo third hand down the line I Would say might be true might not but there's no evidence that it is\nWhere they talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM cake you in a press your belly and on Ninety nine point nine F.

us the house secrecy uh I ... which obviously was necessary military necessity\nOr lead to tragedy and how it it probably interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that help the Christian story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being held off that fee for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages where transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there\nWas a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that Indianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was and I had no McCormick and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know protocol said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indiana Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them you know that was one of the first thing\nI'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants ship the rival didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought while I guess I don't have to report that either\nAnd so he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship was in there and these were all put in place\nTo protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then beyond that you know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the\nReporting you know various subjects in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the coach had been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so you know he should not have been there without an escort he should have had and taking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to see in the battle quickly and hadn't gotten\nAnd so she should've had something you know first of all that sold our second of all that had any harm or ability\nYou know arm or two and a former I mean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her arm early exceptionally sending compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she sang so quickly\nUh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm and so much of that played into the secrecy of the mission and why she was out there and why this information and was it passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions\nKnowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTold me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I Know there's been so many ... wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nI think a big part of that they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families\nTalking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story and so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and\nPutting the story down on film or you know the screenplay and eventually as a book and lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell the accurate story however heart and however long that we take we would tell the true story\nWell he was uh it it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters so you you you have to know these people are a lot of the people who\nAre characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're beating them together I guess from people who did know them but uh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS\nIn Indianapolis oh Lynn talk about him a little bit he's ... he's a he's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat try one of the things that we tried to do is really call back the land on the Indianapolis story because really the man uh before I get pass and not as it is and you know\nCircle back and the man who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis where as an army named Robert an army major name Robert Feldman\nAnd who had spent the last couple of years after the war or renting down all of the material that they hear the Germans were you going to try to develop their own atomic bombs\nAre on the continent of Europe so once that messing with things and then burn and carry decision about components of little boy depending an island um status the final braving the editor of the Europe and and the conflict and so\nIn writing the whole book we try to pull back that rather than bringing in a lot of other a ferret fairs and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in addition to hide for murder we've had him for the call and tell me you've got the waste and ...\nAnd what we tried to do or where you\nHave to recognize it even a pair of men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and doing what\nI'll tell you what do we I'm Sorry to interrupt we have to take a break you know a will come back and you can talk a little bit more about ... some of the other central characters including captain McVeigh who took the brunt of the blame we'll be right back talking about the Indianapolis tragedy you don't go to go see them\nThe\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology and Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around banging on doors asking for radar and more technology for his submarines because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war\nAnd so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of his brother said commanders go down to sell the grave for lack of technology can be very caring you had a wife he has three sons um\nAnd eventually in addition to his um [noise] book which was called fun um we were also able to interview his granddaughter\nA and get even more information about his later life half before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because of the U.S Navy I mean you took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court Marshall per capita McVeigh and then uh\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of how things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to the moments right after the torpedoes slam into the side of the Indianapolis\nChaos breaks out of you know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a note distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there\nTell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes yeah\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind cloud that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know I don't know if he would say it's lucky for how she amount obey the clouds you just part in the movie came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship\nAnd so you know after it was struck getting the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the shift they couldn't communicate over the first time I see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle station they had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship\nSo with the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt\nFirst to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to his mix tape from their compartment and limit hadn't mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship\nAnd even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way in hell you know men went down with her\nAnd were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half is what they believe\nAnd you know those who went down on or went off on the Starbucks inside the low side\nThey would've and with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship 'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off that side and there was no supplies so they weren't in raft they were\nYou know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flatten them that they can find on the water as long as they could and how they could get to someone who can help them you know fellow ship made or whomever\nAnd others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead sailor and put it on them\nI mean this was\nIncredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year old that had just gotten on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission\nTen really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and there and just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nWe kind of a ... actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very thick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like par on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer I'm you know they they say that those who head injuries and didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering are from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this fuel oil\nSo no one really great shape you know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nAnd there was it says you know there were attempts to get a signal out to just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExactly and um\nI guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that the new ones coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding a because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right\nWaves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm Lynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit in this context but there is incredible acts of heroism that you described from some of these sailors\nWho were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nWell that's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned\nThe current they move about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that we'd be together in the morning couldn't be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve foot swells some days it's it's clear as glass says on the day the rescue but Sunday's there these twelve foot wells along with these currents\nSo over time over the course of the the five nights and four days demand become spread out over a twenty five mile area\nAnd I'm One of their rescue pilot later wrote that from\nAltitude I read the plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism access cowardice one one real hero was I'm a captain park he was the commander of the marine detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group in the water the the the as Sarah mentioned the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents\nThe largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd kept in park was in that group and he really than twenty four hours a day trying to keep them in together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets\nWas a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line\nAnd kept in park would uh help the men that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from a dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumbed to hallucinations and and he died\nAnd when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all going to make it [noise]\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite is happening with with and then being a selfish\nAnd men are even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse\nThere was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and they're with hoarding 'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThat's what I was thinking as a hearing these stories even without the injuries and the terrible burns and the\nFact that the water supplies are out there in exposed to the elements reducing they have no water and after\nDays they're just going crazy and then uh you know you have to deal with the sharks that's the that's the terror that most of us know about because of the movie and barely that is not exaggerated the ... not by much any way of Sarah maybe you want to talk about that part of the story\nYeah not at all I mean you know the the shark population in the Pacific at the time was much more concentrated and\nWe're to talk of the quad cities in the living room change you in a ...

enough to\nReally repair the damage and also he was you know and it's very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either\nBut I'm In later interviews Sarah handout from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted with that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had been kept in the day\nHe was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander bills or I'm Sorry captain bill Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned\nBill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do was talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a group of survivors and kept the McVeigh goes up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because\nHe was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from the family didn't feel he'd been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so we chose this like sixty event and how is he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named say city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dreading it that when he got there they actually um travelled out dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have jet ways the way we do now they would they would just stay with the plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines\nAnd when captain make they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the clapping and tears came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receiving him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion we can\nTalk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talked about going through archives and records to share with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get past than and if so what were they\nHad actually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and you know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and\nSure and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking so you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and actually this specific report and we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source to get in our contact said well we don't have an on redacted version doesn't exist and so\nInterestingly enough you know a a friend or actually at a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and same fifty three men\nHis and his grandson was actually I'm an inspector general sorry I'm trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really\nTestimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because\nIn the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how McVeigh was a weird and so it was was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so that new quarter of in Korea document was so important because uh Seventy years later stories can change your stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about uh the lights immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken um I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell a few did die and and if you can imagine how awful that was not only for the men themselves for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sarah yeah three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to face hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um come\nA time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS how ... how ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nI actually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back to their hometowns kind of that I made it got out of the navy kind of them had survivors leave and then got out and then stayed and made careers in the navy\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so that that majority of them and they just kind of put this behind then they went on to have careers and engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic\nAnd um had many many struggles and almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families um they held it in\nFor years and years and years and I'm I'm for sixty years um but mostly they didn't talk about that today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that Robert Shiller character a jaws you know you kept that story bottle up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm\nA that's a very moving scene in it and that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage him in the book or or or did you always have in mind keeping that in there\n[noise] we I had to really you know wouldn't let them have gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book\nYou know one of the things that really comes out every time is that most people learned about this story from ... so it's an essential part of the stories history is that you know the public learned about it this way\nI'm interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home\nSeveral accounts came home saw the movie were really impacted by it and especially this thin and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene is about so you know it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way but that's you know how your dad served in World War two so\nWe've been students or whether you know apple is the book when we come back we'll open up the phone lines and maybe uh maybe you've got some questions or comments or calls we'll be right back\n\nWhen he\n\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and some Sarah they found the ship\nAnd I didn't know what he was talking about it for the morning of and so you know dating my faculty in you know realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nA the ... group which has the vessel that we're slowly responsible for finding the ship and there's been several attempts than they were the first one is to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so bill and I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that their ships had been found so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened in that it happened in their lifetime or what [laughter]\nMostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day of the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies\nAnd so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money stock that his winnings [laughter]\nYou know across the board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but yeah there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt and\nInland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up to the information that ah you know were they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the book since it's come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is a is an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Koch at the survivors reunion and I believe it with money here ten or twenty sixteen and we and while there we'd really like to have your support and your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful in directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of the ship and\nAnd gave the entire history and draw new analysis about various things that happen in the story you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nA boiler we'd nervous about that that he really really has endorsed the story and as men than his full court since he saw like what we came up with\nRowland oh Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm a full big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but ah west of the Rockies Jerry in ... California has a personal connection to the ...\nAre you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one at a ride\nTo rescue those servers and the water and I knew that will be on one car being you know you you know she was discharged from school and I never saw my father used to have sweets years we'll never saw him cry and do you try to talk about that story\nThat's amazing with the uh with the on the USS ... do well or the fact that you know the name of the ship that I\nDo ... and I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone\nAnd I was thinking about that before I call not yeah what was the name of the ship and to me she was the first one who knew him and he was talking ... you ... you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the

Harvard law school graduate navy veteran deployed with the seals in Iraq is a terrific guy is up against the mayor of Tampa\nAndrew Gillum and they had a a no holds barred a doll house excuse me I'm mayor of Tallahassee data no holds barred debate last night moderated by Jake Tapper we played a little bit of this number two\nI Want to bring up an issue that is that it's been plaguing each one of you all start with you a merry go on the FBI spent investigating potential corruption in Tallahassee now for three years the probe appears to include lobbyists\nAnd former a campaign treasurer for you Adam Corey you've been trying to distance yourself from Korea but you've been friends with him for more than a decade and two trips he took together are part of the investigation\nHow plant can Floridians trust your judgment when someone under FBI investigation was part of your inner circle\nYeah well you know we all have friends that sometimes let us down and uh the truth is is let me be very clear about what the record is I Am not under FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government\nAre and what we've done is we welcome that man if there is someone who has done something wrong they ought to be held fully accountable for their actions we made every public record available on a publicly searchable website and our city a contrast how I dealt with the FBI by comparison to how Methodist Santa's deals with the FBI\nOr he has gone out of his way before he quit his job in Congress to protect a Donald Trump or to curb the inquiry by Mr Mahler\nHe is not even so far as to suggest that some deep state is that worked to undermine the presidency is a conspiracy theory if you will so if you take the way we dealt with their investigation as opposed to how Mr dispatchers have dealt with it I'll take our example every single day of the\nWeek the difference between a Andrew means that when I thought what the FBI is a prosecutor I was working hand in hand with them to bring people to justice\nWhen Andrew deals with um he's dealing with an undercover agent posing as a contractor who he was on a junket with a New York city and you went to a Broadway show without undercover FBI agent you went to Costa Rica with the same lobbyists and guess what happened\nThe lobbyists that wine and dine Andrew they got a two million dollar grant from the city government so to me corruption is when you're a position of power you're getting something you shouldn't have had he shouldn't have gotten the Broadway tickets he shouldn't have gotten a trip to Costa Rica and then you give something to someone in return he gave two million dollars to a Mario\nBam bam bam I don't know how Andrew Gillum wins this thing under sensors as a straight shooting prosecutor Harvard law school graduate navy veteran and Florida is booming now they've been hit very hard by hurricane including Michael most recently\nAnd they if they give their state over to Andrew Gillum who cannot run Tallahassee what to expect that happened down there\nThe election is turning towards the Republican President Trump's approval up to forty seven percent unemployment I I told you earlier that story Minnesota's amazing unemployment in Minnesota is too\nI I told you earlier that story in Minnesota's amazing unemployed in Minnesota is to point three percent excuse me two point nine percent that's not actually unemployment\nBut that's below full employment that just people you know people quit and move and do things like that it's it's remarkable what is going on in this country's economy do you want to hand it over to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer do not vote for one Democrat not one at any level\nThe country needs to grow it absolutely needs to grow and the president also we need the best military in the world he talked about that last number five\n[noise] we don't we secured seven hundred dollars and then next year seven hundred and sixteen million dollars to fully rebuild our great American military\n[noise]\nAnd our military well very shortly be far stronger far more powerful modern the best in the world and also it's jobs now when it comes to the military I don't care about the job so much I Want a strong military but as a secondary benefit every ounce of it is built in the United states\nChefs and that that\nThat's going to be keeping on like this for the next two weeks that I Will bring you every single update\nWindsor at the back of the Republicans\nAnd there's a caravan is under scoring you can vote for the party of law or you can

American citizens a Mac [noise]\n\n\nYou're in the middle of a nonstop action pack information but\nThe church is coming right back\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations and one ... gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps\nBut here's what's weird though sometimes we have a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save huge money life changing money if you switch to manage chair for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family it's five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just doing the math at six thousand dollars a year that\nThe significant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members and met a share and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save\nAnd why men is shared it's so popular go to
