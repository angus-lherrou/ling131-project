I like to talk\nMuch of a social life I'll just say that all admit that I I Do like\nYour lips your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the difference is now I think I found it interesting that you had said to me\nThat people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to the spirit were years back people would get ... why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family members somebody know true life you know\nNo that was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to me though is is basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history\nA but primarily through the the the Victorian era up and up at today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in the winter of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know young Lady Macbeth I mean bank close though there's\nThere there there there's no shortage of go see him in literature and history but you know typically go to war or if it's typically if people want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking\nDo you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to 'em and your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently\nAnd the idea that somebody would go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a Wally house or you know what what have you\nGo to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that just happens to be there and say\nHi can you give us inside and you don't know me but tell me about yourself that that that's a that's a relatively new phenomena and it's it's ... you know you go back to look at the the the onto that were held in in the Victorian era\nOff in an upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady day Crumpet some tea and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou had the the spiritual is era [noise] um and you have people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is to you know came to the states and Kate Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nIn your hair your privacy has researching all that and then and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record to communicate with ghost\nA through white noise and prove based broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day goes on her with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and what sort of techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't end and how do we know\nYeah and he could not you know it's already kind of creepy in Africa or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to the spirit\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you by\nPeople take that step further and they hope in a pinch and you don't know who they're poking at near I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up on that side of the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going looting or looking at the sky life I don't want something going on with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... it you know you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends aren't they should change along and changes like you know so quick provoking quit smoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they were there with that you're not doing yourself when you hear of thereby poll whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is that the people are not evil or what it is it All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that same typically\n[noise] ... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to the more science based a somewhat skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I just miss everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe any we're you know sound as that goes and so the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish\nA water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious sound or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is can we tested repeatable rises it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and create any TV reality you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV\nShows as you pointed out I was a so I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of goes hunting 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do with and do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking to it so I'll give you one quick centers on TV you and I actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is the typical engage in what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... you know you EMS or magnetic uh frequencies of water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment and looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these ratings and walk around a little ... sort of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at this at at three oh eight PM am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claims they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the clams are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on and we're going to walk around here and all these sorts of things\nAnd and and that that's part part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that\nThat in almost all cases\nThey don't they don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see a ghost town are going to location maybe there's team of him and bill you know they'll take readings for three hours or six hours wherever else and then they'll go home and analyze them\nThe problem is that that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal or abnormal you need to know what's normal and you know whatever\nReadings you get when you're walking around with the M. F. detector magnetometer whatever it is with reading and you get over that six hours that there could be normal variation that that's the only happens once a week or something\nIt's just human nature and that we're talking we're learning about how he is describing investigating theory inside his look we've got more than that come in at the same way in celebrating we [noise]\n[noise]\nGuy who's the minutes ... percent or more on motorcycle insurance\nSimilar to do a triple Garber on the on the recipient of of Chubb recover photos [laughter] usually mean dogs in Texas but I after you explain that to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the goes photos of them sent\nOur our ... by some fear people who just photographs something weird and they yeah they're not lying there not too much not top one over on me they're like hey can I owe him they're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise]\nUm and so you know I I go into each case um you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can answer one of the things that I encourage them to do and I can't always do this myself because you are if if someone some of the if a photograph I can just drop what I'm doing playoff to you know\nTo Denver so today [laughter] researcher goes photos much why not\nBecause I have a trademark we left wing and gun is out there [laughter]\nTo split it with me that's all I ask you\nKnow but it's also there's a couple of thinking more of them is is I Want one possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so you you mentioned earlier um one case of known for which was a fan of the courthouse coast case\nThat happened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing orb thing that the cost is this real EMS camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy ah so you know that there's probably [laughter] that would that make that gave\nHim credibility right it's a deputy yeah I'm a court of camera so\nThe likelihood of being a hoax was dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was I went to the story a it was made national news and people are all this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I I went up there and investigators night I went in and I went to the courthouse I look at the camera and I talked to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be um and I did some experiments I I've been actually solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and he tried to figure out what are all kind of explanations rights away\nTo figure out what or alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could it be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there are some I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I tried to list those\nAnd I tried to rank them terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify\n'em and you just basically go down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the seaport and uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicated so you know for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood and I said you know\nA ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said\nYou know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and try to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time a day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI T cell and I get I get that and but you know I get that thing whatever that might be in there like that and it might be people might think well I'll give you another example of one of which\nAre going to say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody\nA and actually I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this was the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of different you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one is looking into you know strange image to their left and so\nThat suggests that they probably didn't feed the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see where the eye and some things are picked up from a certain angle and not another angle um students\nYou know there's some things that are seen that he shot in the way the shadow is in that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are\nThat can mean it looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame place was hunting for sure so you talk about a Bill Clinton man has changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure sort of the things we're looking a measure that that we can't measure right now on science you know\nWell yeah I mean they you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know of ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there was some uh goes hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the go between the equipment and just you know there's cameras in him after all is like you know probably Seventy thousand dollars of all the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera out with this wasn't like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with were finished shooting Oregon America hotel I said\nI said why do you think why do you think it is that that we don't we still don't have good quality evidence of goes uh I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago so you know even\nThe the evidence of getting a better it's all these blurry or business not and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost\nAnd I said yeah but if that's true if you believe that that and why why they choose friends wise you bring in Seventy thousand dollars was a man yesterday\nAnd I said I got to be mean here but it's like you on one hand you're telling me that that oh well we can't leave it to go through all the gear well then why do you have all this gear and he he didn't really have an answer so you know one thing to keep in mind here is that\nIs that is that you know if it goes can be seen with the with the naked eye and of course they often are because they're reporting is being seen then then by definition we should be able to see them on camera and of course that's why you have goes photographs or videos and stuff and\nIf we can hear ghost and if you if there's a mysterious sounding voice or something coming from somewhere then that means that that by definition their their material because we you know\nSound is Adia waves and and you know hitting the eardrum and stuff and so you can pressing audio waves and so\nSo that's that means that they can be recorded\nUm on on you know audio tape and and and digital things and so so you know when we're looking at the different technologies that are used as that goes for the most part they are ones that the replicate what we can experience right we were well we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know if they're recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... dramatic filled with actors\nAnd the problem is that there's no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation but ... but no one has ever proved that you know the location with high EMS\nUm correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the God helmet\nA and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science or in goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me because I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome and if they're real and I want to I Want to be able to find them improve them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen to and he was looking for though the ... he was in a bag
