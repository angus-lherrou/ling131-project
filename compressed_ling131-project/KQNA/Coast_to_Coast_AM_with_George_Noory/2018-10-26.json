P. Morgan adding one million ounces to their stockpile of a hundred and thirty three million ounces\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build a huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes they have short are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's with that\nThat's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program in the community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it's starting to get exciting\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything you can send them so they can learn more\nWe do George we're going to make a special offer it's our latest sky high silver report the report the twenty dollar value but your listeners get a free just call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nAnd ... that a quarter of a light year oh no it's not even close to a quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light date is\nTwo and a half light games from earth is that the border between the kinds of rebels and the or cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border as\nWell why is it that made you an is drawn him or realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first plane\nHit the clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto they travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep off in one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly round the sky\nThe fact that they're all off in this one direction can only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headline in October of twenty Eighteen are about either one of the smaller object to being swept off my whatever the massive ... called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you use any two people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through the ... Marion in all of that because\nIt does come up a lot what exactly are rogue planet how can planet me wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rope planets and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that plant nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other\nAnd one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened a planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if if it had gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter could have been completely ejected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it\nWhen people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there's a giant planet that it's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracies stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something massive like a planet cannot sneak up on earth and the inner planets with out every ... on her knowing\nIf something like number I don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd he would have been invisible to every backyard astronomer with the whole scope for the past decade and it would have been visible to every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even out played out in the Congress about what would be the obvious observation all changing ... nation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers are being apart meaning the planets that we know of planet nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven now seven times the mass of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planet is in the solar system and nobody sits around in his worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter's so it's a fact that it's really minimal one effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nYou you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe it'll be successful this time would it be possible that talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers for\nThe way the process works as we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so if we have found what we're looking for we will\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then to that point will announce existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to a total scope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right of ways we won't make the world wait\nSo January of twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIt's possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue and my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know what you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it'll take a one year so maybe I mean still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nThat there you have it Oregon right from the man who discovered the uh in terms of those ... nations of those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy for ballot in the uh or cloud in that area\nAnd I think one of the most important part of doing this research project with these scientists is that I have no confusion about the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move in to our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the thought and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and you're on us our because Pluto is a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing that could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because\nGravity that that's the thing about gravity and that\nIt it would have an impact on every single thing and that's\nAbout all the way I would've loved those ... have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work that I had a discussion of face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting that even if she doesn't agree and some of the theories that are out there\nThe fact that there's this extra planets out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody knew about the stuff\nWell the idea that there could be a massive planet but when you read let's say about the ana knocking through scholar I Do the translation that we're a carbon done and you look at the carving from one thing that always is\nConfusing to me talking about a Trump planet but in the can of form or eleven has got\nTo hold on right there among the most come back we'll look for the set up in conversations\n\n\nEight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six\n[noise]\n\nBanned won't go back to coast to coast Georgian or what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change winter\nYou know Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world but it really kind of waiting not seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blanket around the yard\nAnd at the United nation many countries especially the worry about being I run and with the level rise plot and population\nThey came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change down in the eye can see and the object gave way to provide data about or changes on an ongoing thing\nTo help project impact on world politics and the economy\nPacked on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the PCC committed they're doing a twenty Eighteen report written by night and one scientist from forty countries\nThe question was should humans to restrict global warming to two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen IPC answer is\nStricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit\nShould be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's the only a decade from now because if we don't if I planet continues to warm up above that limit at one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn that will be a catastrophe of math die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs\nAnd if they die that kills outside their marine species dependent upon the coral\nWeather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires\nWeather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food and fresh water\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more island accounts populations to move but to where the twenty Eighteen IPC reports said the next ten years\nBetween now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations and my cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity\nCoal it as an end up three around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author or the IPC the report says quote\nThis kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington\nWhich seems to pretend that this climate change threat does not exist but this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen ... he\nIs professor drew Chanel PHD professor of earth sciences and the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those are Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana so those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where we'd be the five top nations in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by sea level rise\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report says\nCountries want to the United nations to investigate a lower warming target thinking the\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also ... from the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lying countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population being very close to sea level Nigeria has huge population level but you know showed us most of the world than the United states also has an enormous populations are right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's it's a combination of rising sea levels and melting ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the wage can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels and so a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already happened to be evacuated and moved to higher ground so it's not so much the north slope but this house\nIn the west coast and who is paying for that\nI Believe it's a combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground yeah\nAnd you can see that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina well\nThere's not been so much evacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events sooner now becoming quite common\nSo I think that there is likely to have to be evacuations in the next couple decades of at least some places there's an island is not to speak for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia more than half of it it was already going\nWe've seen the water come up through the dream skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance slugging it was very rare it's become so commonplace that governments have had to put a marker so that motorist can see how deep the flooding is it's so routine in Florida it's been some of the worst\nFlooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine ... has continued and we have seen an acceleration because both the Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than most expected just a decade a coke and become more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models\nAnd then watch the models has often been to conservatives and things are happening faster than the models project\nCan you give an example of one who's been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of the ice in the Arctic went like two or three times faster than the models project to\nUse the Arctic has melted two to three times faster than the computer's projecting already by twenty Eighteen ... that a harbinger of the fact that he likely the warming and melting them I Will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWell we've been observing from satellites that melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating so that is definitely ovaries\nIs extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized\nBased on say melting from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the bit below you know we were really because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater vulnerability is drought greater likelihood of pie fire conditions and we see flooding in the heat 'cause you get more extreme heavy rainfall events\nAnd the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd will even see sheet extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat waves that killed thousands of people\nThat kind of thing that would have been you know maybe every fifty years or so that will start to become more and more frequent and it'll begin to happen maybe every decade or so where places like Phoenix\nWill fill hits extreme heat for Phoenix\nFor the belly heating and

this very light being in fact a reptile snake\nI got more that it was more like in in fact than a snake because it had a texture to it ... it was like\nYou know what a insect wings look like they're kind of transparent but you can see those veins or whatever going through it when I Lived in Florida when I was a kid we lived there for a short time in Jacksonville\nAnd always always outside and I loved collecting animals and things like that but there are a huge plant manager says they would hang out on the bushes the standing assembled arms and the shape of its neck and its body\nAre you

had a lot of texture you\nKnow it was white it had like ... old I Would say you know how they would be like model skin like someone who had black holes are almost like an albino salamander skin\nIt sounds like you're describing it ... skin not a praying mantis skin\nBut actually it was like that yeah\nBut the swarm was like a praying mantis into\nThat time I Would describe it because of the army

positive and protective\nI Do absolutely do I've had many dreams only get past few years involving a lot of water mostly\nHow does the water emerge\nI've had many dreams as you know I mean he's from

glass that's the feeling I get from that I Am the storm boating feeling\nThat everything is going to get more violent and wetter\nYes now um last night\n... well\nIt is and things keep being more than they started with the issue of uh I was asking\nPeople if they had had any kind of childhood out of body in the ages four to six\nA which is amazing to me how many people have been provoked by that that seemed to overlay the appearance of whatever the white uh we'll call it ... smoker smoky fog than his period in my office twice\nThat led to my asking for a whether people had had these kinds of foggy white stuff\nAnd that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duck the an experience or meditate or out they had any insight about water a lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science we\nSaid that a kid work on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nWhen that it would cause tsunamis in tremendous amounts of flooding\nAnd I had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that is written about in genesis\nAnd that is how low and and a complex all of this seems to be going that every single question is leading to answer that people are raising more issues and scientists are also coming forward and saying that they have information about this\nAnd so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information\nAbout a huge water\nThat could end up affecting our planet\nWhere they shall never call much with Congress or Asians were window which is coming up later but we've got more when we come

from a retired us air force staff sergeant named Tony guy he also sent me daily to fourteen\nTo prove his military background which I have included at the end of my earth files news report\nTonight this email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in titled quote\nThe experience that made me a believer that we are not alone and it began Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw\nAs a black child I Am fifty seven now but at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty six\nI was in my bed one night and I have woke up and could not go back to only hearing now from Winston Salem North Carolina that tell any down voice\nLike that and him as a child and haunted him to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nI live in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she waited two bedroom apartment my mother had two children and my mother's friend had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment\nAnd Fitch two levels you have to go up the stairs we get to the bedrooms and bathrooms and I was in my bed sleeping along with my brother and two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night a trouble going back to sleep and not just\nThe earning in the dark and go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of it and I went to the window\nAnd I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet in like ... year cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up look up in the sky you know just looking around because it was really actually with a grassy field in between the apartment\nAnd so I look up and actually a light\nUp a light light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light that I was looking at because it was the only thing in the sky I noticed something was coming down and by the time my notes that he may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground\nThe light that I was looking at came down it was a new or\nWhat I noticed about it was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they had the glow sticks that are young green glow sticks right\nIt look like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all is if you got the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would have been if it were perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed the word it to light met in the middle a white lie in line green light there was no bleed over you can clearly see where the neon green ended in ... in this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the service was translucent and you could see through it\nYou know I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a seafood bloom so pretty and it's like you're looking at a seafood belong\nAnd what are you seeing what I'm seeing\nAnd what are you seeing what I'm seeing is\nA person standing in five the fall white part wearing down and he's looking up\nJust standing there looking up like he's looking up into the stars [noise]\nI don't know what are you looking at but I could clearly see this announcement and them myself look at that that's a purchase and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from like the\nOnly reason I incline out the window that night because of our lives like if you knock out the screen and go down there you go on to the\nBeach [laughter]\nYou know what I was like man I Want to go but I'm going to be do you know I Know she is but I just didn't understand it was a kid with significant for this\nOkay to this very close to you as you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time and this is the conversation I was having to myself\nMan this person looks like God and then I thought I'm not going to say that unless he actually pills please go out and ride and then I'll go man you sure looks like the guy who could at your church describe everything\nThe galaxy was wearing like when you're looking at the all white I notice it was bright bright colors and the white light you can tell the difference between fall blight and bright white\nI could clearly see that the gal was white very bright white he was looking up and leave those car cages and he had a brunette hair and it came down to say his shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWhat his hair straight wavy for curly\nI'd say we're straight dislike you see when you see these motion pictures are Jesus as well Ruth ... but it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color in his eyes\nYou know I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd what was the shape of the down\nFrom board I get free it looked like it cold over his head but all look like one followed piece and they went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his feet in this year a goal craft\nYou know I couldn't so how do you know it went down to ... feet\nBecause I could see that when we're the or where he was standing when he was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole atmosphere it's kind of strange because I could see him in it but I couldn't look in the green part in the apartment buildings on the opposite shot\nSince I'm twenty five to thirty feet and the four year old looking out your apartment second storey window you\nAre able to look through the surface of the white side of this year goal\nOr or craft and see the man inside the white side yes but you could not see into the lime green and you could see past the line and the white yes\nAnd the fact that he blocked out the apartment buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that even though it appeared very strange to you that he had to have been solid matter or at least blocking some times to have blocked out the buildings that were behind it\nYes it is the is floating down if you would blow up a blow into food in the air to about ... feet this thing was coming down and I was thinking that it was going to ...\nI Need to get down there he asked the person some questions you know but ah as it got toward the ground I watched it go on to the ground like it was it even the\nLike the ground was not there\nWe're to talk of the quad cities in the

I don't know if the word is dissolve a but transform into gold sparkly\nTo light what you were describing it reminds me and the the people who have had this experience they all say that it is a bit like seeing your skin your body your hand everything turning in to a like very fine gold sparkly dust\nThat is a phenomena that I'm curious about\nAnd if anybody listening to Kosovo night\nKnows anything about that specific it's not you're not dying it is a transition that is seen by The Mind's eye that the body is changing into gold sparkly dust but then after they have gone a unconscious or whatever the missing time is\nThey are back alive and remembering that memory extremely vividly I find that also a very interesting and wonder George if you ever heard of that\nWell what's what's happening to me is when you think about the biblical issues that we've seen paintings yeah almost all the characters and should huge orange run their head was markedly lunch with\nYeah sparkly gold often that's true and what is\nThis and I don't think that it is something being made up I think it is I think part of the universe and other dimensions that we had been denied or have never been told or ever educated about it's always been a thrown into the bin of missed solitaire or something else\nAnd that we've got to start looking at all of this in terms of a brand new cosmic understanding of the physical relationship\nBetween the now the universe we are in it could very likely be a projected hologram it would have to be projected from another dimension more\nAnd more physics papers are being written about more and more evidence of other dimensions and if we cycle if the soul is the important part\nAnd at the moment of death we transition into one or more different dimensions depending upon something having to do with the growth of the soul that not all souls we'll go to the same dimensions than recycling back into matter universes past it\nGoing back into matter universes has to be a huge and common part of that cycling and we have been left dumb and blind about it\nOur first time caller Steve interrupted Steven going that your\nHeart George Carlin do my question is do

there were people who are at risk about safety that we would not do go we'll take a hard\nTime into it and yeah I understand your question and I have had to live with it for a very long time forty years uh where I began my first investigation into animal needle Asian in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's twenty teens drink sharpest was one of the out strange harvest\nAnd uh it was a a well received a documentary it was awarded a regional Emmy uh so I was dealing from a pure as pure fact they journalism as I could in that film and I had to wrestle myself\nWith the question of going out into pastures often by myself together tissue in and various things at my vulnerable and having to decide within myself\nThat I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me\nA so be it and I am still here and I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I have been where Adam mutilated animals are\nNow what I'm trying to do is set up a different lens and framework here\nYes there are animal mutilation that were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago in many parts of the planet as well\nThose animal sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence that is today in the twentieth and twenty first century\nOr doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up to do an animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular I think that there are many facets\nI think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help from something else why the help does it make itself front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact\nThat humans have been abused and misused by a tremendous number I think\nOther intelligence is using this planet in the solar system now that doesn't the fed and human being cruel to each other\nAnd the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible but I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human creature\nThat we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution\nOf our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence is\nUntil all of us know all of the truth then animal mutilation that human abductions and all of the facets which seemed very disturbing may\nNot be understand ... be understood in a correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting and that is why I feel so strongly that we have got to

number two\nThe president's rhetoric senator I really don't see them in the enemy of the American people for example they lose my best do these violent tendencies at least in some people [noise]\nWhy I think that that's obvious I've ever concerned about this for a long time by a small crowd at her like in a set of starting in January about the president's rhetoric\nLet's remember we have a president who has talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against the media uh just last week talking about the assault on a reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that he he's he's kind of guy\nTo hard to see this outside of the context of the president's hostility hostility towards towards Mrs Clinton who tried to briefly speak towards unity tour to block Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies the need to dial down to the political rhetoric and they are making people laugh they they are making journalists last day and they're making law enforcement officer is less\nSafe but we don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive was\nRight but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but it's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros\nThese are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack demonize is caused by if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nAnd that but certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid\nMid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nI mean there are all people that Donald Trump pay they are all a people that he has used violent ugly incendiary rhetoric against uh whether it's journalists like CNN where there were John Brennan\nIt's a weather as journalists like CNN where there were John Brennan letter wasn't dressed or Hillary Hillary Clinton you know from the lock her up chants\nAnd you know I was in tax thing when former colleagues to CNN and they're scared and one highly former colleagues fat\nThis is what happened when the president called the enemy of the people are tired and I thought my gosh you know it's it's a tone and coming from the top and now fan and has become a target journalists that are simply Chinatown and we did\nThree hours ago the president is either a very later got up very early tweeted us\n[laughter] [noise]\nFunny out lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me will even blaming me for the current state of bombs in ridiculously comparing this to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing writes the president you know when I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential\nBut walk a lot of people are claiming Trump and that's silly we don't know who to blame you know we we can by members of the bombs and we find that out in the FBI with ten or eleven packages are going to have\nThat or if it wasn't so serious it would be like a holiday Quantico where the FBI lab as they got more leads and then they do points on my airline mileage 'em out\nSo there'll be finding and it's either going to be you know a professional alligator grapple or in Florida living in the Everglades boil the same Russian GRE ... types who used a nerve agent in in London on ...\n[laughter] and then said they were tourists Chuck Todd by the way agrees with me about this ... number one\nChecked I have this fear that it could be some shut affirmation to designed to do what's\nHappening now more of this you know ... and so in some ways we shouldn't rule out of\nYeah don't rule out the Russians also rule out Bob Hugin to New Jersey don't rule out Patt Morrison West Virginia don't rule out little book murder in Wisconsin when I went my run down that got us to a Republican night a plus five wins I'm not really expecting that\nBut I mean if the way it can I think there's a lot of discuss growing with the media right now over the non coverage of the care of it\nSo I I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about where we are\nIn terms of the uh the election way there is no blue wave that are might be a red way I think people are met the media I think there are rallying behind the president there running around some great candidates and this could be a real surprise election like a real surprise election night\nSo stay with me we're going to have a\nYear in the middle of an Jon ... author of Americans our mission right after the lights out because

of I guess what I'm saying is that [noise] and this will you on the\nPresident's ... such creatures I think they're wonderful man and extraordinary dressed and I do that too but when you say in this political environment I liked the humanize rather than demonizing you agree with me on that I\nDon't mean to I mean did not I don't mean to demonize them at all\nAs creatures they're they're just very very firm original as they are um ... committed texture was to the document as it was understood at the time of the framing\nRight but\nThe world will disagree is that I think that the Heller decision which I picked because that was a decision is two thousand eight it's the one on the second amendment\nAs you well know and um that a ... call that his masterpiece yes at the ... the the clearest articulation of originalism in the Supreme Court decision last year far yes and\nAnd so when I look at it and look at the actual behavior and thinking of Madison and the spring of Seventeen eighty nine when he's writing the second amendment and the debate in both the house and then in the Senate\nAtlanta debate in the eleven states that ratified what's going on there has nothing to do with owning a gun it has to do with whether or not the defense of the republic will be in the hands of state militias\nOr a federal army and their great fear of a federal army as big as a standing army not just a fear of what the British Army representatives that's primary even of the continental army\nYou're absolutely right that is the Justice Stevens descent and I think American dialogue exception expands on her way that he did not that might persuade you know people are undecided on the other hand I I Am persuaded by the general understanding in the states at that time concerning firearms in frontier defense that even beyond the militia people of course\nHad the right to carry weapons and Stewart discussion instead of what I wanted to get to what I really liked about American dialogue and I want everyone on my team the originals team to go and get as you explain how James Madison came to bed early at first and then\nI'm a resigned himself to and then maybe even a applied equal representation in the Senate and the necessary means of getting to where he wanted to get which was ... he didn't want to get the bill sovereignty\nHe wanted more he's more Hamel Tony than most people know and you lay it out there was no doubt in anyone's mind at the end but the state's would forever have equal representation in the upper body correct\nYes though he regretted it I mean ... but he knew that it was absolutely essential if the constitutional first to pass and then be ratified because it was a gesture towards a state sovereignty us\nAnd that the the the makeup of the convention and then the make up the ratification conventions was are filled with people who were very dubious about any federal government that created a consolidated power structure\nThat was the creation of the British leviathan they thought they were a gaping from and so if he hadn't made that compromise um it would've never passed and he was as I was saying earlier committed to a a a making those kind of compromise decisions\nAnd he later said you know that was the only thing to do and but when he first left the convention in September of Seventeen eighty seven and they wrote to a Jefferson he said we failed um because the Senate issue that you're describing you is it still gives the states\nI'm a stronger I'm of a subset of authority and power than we thought we we we could allow and that that will be a problem for us so\nIt requires a unanimous consent of the states to amend that provision and therefore I don't think I'd ever will be I have one suggestion Irene graduate\nI Know I agree that the the big decision they made was Nineteen Thirteen to make the Senate elected not by the state legislatures but but by the people at large and he would have supported that too um but there does come to be a problem here in the sense that\nLet's say north and South Dakota have for representatives with the total population that's less than half the size of Los Angeles\nBut if you look at Rhode Island versus Virginia the framing that sort of disparity in Vermont even worsening Vermont had the greatest disparity with Virginia at different\nThat's true although Rhode Island didn't count as a didn't show up\nBut Vermont did let let me give you a suggesting that hold you over to the break if I can professor at the suggestion is I always used or when Jim risky partner and some are committed
