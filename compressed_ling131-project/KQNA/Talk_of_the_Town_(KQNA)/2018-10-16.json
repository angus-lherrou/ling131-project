have we had Al Sharpton it attacks debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nDon't lead by example lead by example if you believe in what you're saying\nThere's no piracy here for Republicans\nTaxes sock because we think outside of our military and our courts you flush somebody down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste it which you prove what's right all the time\nWe would rather donate it to charity and let the free market and an charities handle it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big tidy ball flush and you flood shut down the ball and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise at all\nFair share not all they don't they already paid to was cut their taxes let them put their money to work in the economy grow jobs in the economy yeah\nWhy do you like them apples how do they taste\nI got some more numbers we be maybe after Syria where does this come from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component with Trump that we didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment\nThis is the first year of my life that my wife and I really you've done well um my show the book things just did well they did thanks a lot of you by the way that things just did well I mean they'll need to go into the details\nBut talking to my account and I was absolutely floored I couldn't really couldn't believe it when we found out how much money the government\nI was astonished I really was that will be a very fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for we don't we don't live of the frugal lifestyle at all I mean she's me at spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda were not cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot so we don't get to go out\nI'm telling you I was floored I thought he had a decimal point wrong\nAnd I probably had straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island straight so whatever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law steaks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was floored this is the first time my life I thought to myself\nI'm Serious folks and my wife is probably going to kill me for talking about this but it's okay I I mean it because I think this needs to get out there\nI grew up\nAt the low end at bats the middle class and being generous 'cause I'm ... I'm sort of sob story\nThe low end of middle class at best okay like at one point the bologna for dinner kind of you know what I'm getting university where I'm getting better middle class like yeah we will a mistake was not I was a hot commodity mind when it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis okay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go to\nI worked my butt off where there was that the police department in the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service and you finally get to a point in your life\nAnd for the first time you make it can be legitimately life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them were so yeah I mean we're going to be able to do I don't want to be dramatic about this\nBut you think to yourself\nI got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C to do was\nTo do what\nAre you serious to do what I don't mind my cat I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role in government I military guys take my money [laughter] is we need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but you weren't flushing your money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe need we ... we need to seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they're just burning it\nIt's the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and it said I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrat in D.C to flush down the toilet bowl\nThe worst unbelievable\nI I think it's because\nI grew up at the lower and middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class later on I guess I mean I don't know I don't know what the categories I don't care I'm again I'm not trying to make the story more dramatic than it needs to be\nBut I guess it said I genuinely respected dollar because I Know what it's like and then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over and they just mega amounts to the government for me at least probably not for anyone else who's really rich which I'm not [noise]\nBut I just I'm paying by every ounce of it it just sucks so bad\nBuild my business everything we can hire new people to write for the website and we can't 'cause I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C\nTo burn right sorry getting off track you can tell them kind of hot on this topic here's another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we pay\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers\nTop fifty percent pay Ninety\nSeven percent of all income taxes type ... percent the top fifty percent of earners\nPay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar\nSeven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar of taxes Ninety seven\nNine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter\nIt matters folks because the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers\nPart a logical event pay three percent\nIf the topic the pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than about fifty three percent of the tax code\nSo this Bloomberg peace they did an interesting analysis\nThey said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest end or is this will make sense of the second I promise\nWhat percentage or number of the highest and earners also pay an equivalent three percent of the actual like the bottom fifty percent of the yours in the country [noise]\nLadies and gentlemen the evil rich that the left talks about the Bernie Sanders tides\nI'm using their terminology show how the pure stupidity of their comments you're never going to believe is the top zero zero one percent of income taxpayers in other words judge fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one comment for ... for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top earners in the United states\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers in the country\nTell me again please with a straight face\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share for heat a hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the ... at the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or if so you're not paying their fair share really party do even though these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax code as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely you read it for the rich no no no no no no I made it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a fair share is\nFair so when you make up a doping stupid talking boy the rich do it or fish or they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of fired up about to say All right if you want to give us call it's seven seven three one two three and one more than eight seven seven three one two three one one of the
