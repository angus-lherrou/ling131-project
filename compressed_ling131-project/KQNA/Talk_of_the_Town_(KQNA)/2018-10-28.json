traffic traffic has on and on the other third degree felony and other parking violation misdemeanors recently twenty four houses guy not in prison\nHe committed multiple families but here's a bigger question for you ladies and gentlemen and this was sent to me by buddy of mine the New York times and other news outlets keep referring to this guy is a registered Republican right\n\nPretty previously been convicted of felonies according to their same store in these other stores so he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote in Florida\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states in the blue city to keep pushing for the rights of felons to vote\nAfter they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you're heard Gillum mentioned it and one of the debate summer even pushing for the ride of felons to vote while they're in prison\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida\nHe should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the writer felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it soon Mike by the way because the left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Arnie of ironies to do exactly that\nSo unless he had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I Would ask the news media out there the New York's slime constipated news network MSL or stay all of you\nHow did he become a registered Republican\nWhen that was supposed to be stripped off the off the rolls\n\nNow once again\nYou don't automatically restore the ride of Ellen's devote when they get out of prison in Florida even though the left has a ballot measure right now for this election to do exactly that\nSo that's not job would have had as right to vote restored Yvette past\nWhere we hear this holiday season remember to shoplift scratch\nMore with the Sixers holidays strategist tickets from the Arizona Lottery slaves were\nReally used

society cannot work quite frankly law enforcement can do is John [noise] if it does have a relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to a gun to all the time with either and they have already have to go too far [noise] by their very presence\nBy the very trusted the a fire in community and in society is supposed to be able to bring most situations you\nKnow this is sick and this man is sick from a a philosophical ideological perspective either a radical\n\nHe is sick from a philosophical and political perspective\nHe is sick from a philosophical and political perspective he knows this not to be true you have\nCriminals in society including in poor neighborhoods who cannot be reason with rapists\nMurderers would be rape is will be murders robbers wouldn't be robbers and so forth and so on at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon to a gun to a baton to a taser then they have already\nGone too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they inspiring community and that society they're supposed to be able to bring most situations the heel\nHere this incredible\nAnd Debbie Wasserman Schultz has no problem with this she thinks she's great because of the news conference today in support of Andrew Gillum here's what she had to say cut twelve go\nI just want to share with you [noise]\nHow heartbroken I was I had my incredible fast [noise]\nWho are taking care of the people I represent every single day\nAnd deal with that kind of her [noise]\nWhile serving like insects\nAnd so we're going to make sure\nIt's one of the reasons that we have to elect Andrew Gillum\nGot [noise]\nA story that we can stand up for the values of the community\nAnd the values of the community is to trash the cops even in the face of this\nThat's a press conference today\nAnd they weren't Debbie Wasserman Schultz to know that she's a victim that her staff\nHerseth victims\nBut so was Donald Trump junior a victim and so is Eric Trump a victim and so as Donald Trump victim\nAnd so as Lara Trump of act\nAnd so was Marco Rubio victim it's so Susan Collins a victim and so as General Mattis a victim\nAnd I just don't remember all the outpouring of anguish by the media I just don't remember it\nDay in and day out\nNow this isn't about moral relativism ever anything of that sort this is about absolute\nBold faced boy ten hypocrisy\nAnd Steve ... was actually\nShot and almost murdered\nAs others were shot\nLuckily this cook either didn't know what he was doing or didn't intend for these bombs to go either way\nAnd the New York times titled plus he's a registered Republican I'm trying to figure out how that can be\nI'm not saying he's not I just want to know more\nBecause once you're a felon in Florida you're not automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically the far like clemency board did he do that did he get approval I mean this guy two thousand two\nIn two thousand two he made a bomb threat\nHe made a bomb threat\nIn two thousand two he's not a clean slate\nThe way he wants or\nThe perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric and whoever was doing this\nThat was the insinuation\nThat pushed him over the edge and that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't there's multiple felonies in his past\nThe guy threatened to use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh\nLong before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States he was arrested in two thousand\nTwo according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place project or discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd it was pointed out in the Washington Examiner\nHe made the bomb threat because he was angry at a Florida utility worker St people do not make these threats\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum medical you intrusive Andrew Gillum\nWhats say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy clubs or anything of this or no no no\nThey should figure out how to make the guy he'll be more you know community relations\nMy community relations\nI tell you what\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would not from a conspiracy prospect or anything else just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slime so Washington compost constipated news network MS LSD and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that than I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first report it to tell us how [noise]\nWas because Florida [noise]\nIs not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is because um [noise]\nPeople on the uh Florida clemency board game as registration at what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one should be able to vote [noise]\nYou take one atom of nitrogen and bond with one

ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrats\nI think I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker so I'd be very very careful\nAbout playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so I'm we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't support that at all it's more of the case though you know you're you're asking why do we push the buttons why go to our anyway why ever attacked orders that doesn't have the right way to do things the way we're fed up\nWhile the media like to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr Zucker over at CNN and uh the clown that runs him and tell us they they've decided that they are political operations in that they want to um

normal right like the math on an\nAlly like let let's let on you say there's a moral issue here so\nI don't think people should be able to pay their way out of the illegal behavior or not somebody and and watch all also sees because many of them are and very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook\nWhat I'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax that well if that's already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how do how do you push them into that system\nWhile I'm thing even for legal immigration coming to this country we gotta have something going for the phone\nWhile we needed to limit the number of people coming into the country legally and illegally that's it\nLike this is not Nineteen Eighteen twenty eighth team it's a new ball game I don't know what that means I mean it's the new economy we can't whereby the fangs\nDown in the Nineteen twenties during college his presidency we had a during that period before and slightly after we had like a twenty year respite on immigration you wear that\nI Wish it was to some extent or a matter of us being able to just slow things down assimilate people within our system to take a look at how it's shaking out in terms of our school systems turns of law enforcement terms a local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but what's happening is the left is flooding the field\nMore and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never in American history we actually have a political party that you cheering illegality\nCheering so I I I don't but I appreciate your ... people come up with tax schemes and everything else it's beyond tax games it's beyond well let's have them pay three times and no no let's enforce the law\nWhich enforces the law and many people who come
