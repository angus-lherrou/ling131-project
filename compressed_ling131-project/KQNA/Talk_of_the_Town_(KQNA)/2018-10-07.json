we'll blow yourself after I you know it's funny because here you had Cory Booker decades part of gifts and and he told us he was having his Spartacus moment\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like actually wants to give up the hearing aids continued it's kinda like Lindsey Graham's like the grandson a difference and you know the Grinch is hard grew three ... three times a day\nAs let's say that a Lindsey Graham's\nIntestinal fortitude grew three times\nOver the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\nI Am very much based on information on the arguments the information that provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always tracked on Supreme Court nominees and you you may be a boon whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination but President Trump\nWe had four percent more Americans\nSay that he should be confirmed and not get to that debate find that's where we've started\nAfter we had the first here\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus\n... percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed but not in other words\nDespite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know what else is on them\nIt didn't change public opinion at all not at all\nNow it's interesting because\nAs consistent as I was we did see with Christine for delegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning now yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing\nWe did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory on Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw about what's in the mid shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed\nAgain prior to the testimony\nAfter after everything that the media\nAnd the politicians did to Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today\nWell it's kind of interesting\nBy a forty six to forty five marching\nAmericans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed\nNow they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as\nPublic opinion despite all the emotions all emotion the all the nonsense real Spartacus across the board to gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom ... in terms of the opinion about that\nWhat's instructive inside of that seven percent\nTo pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating\nIs when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nPretty much what the American people want to have happen near\nBy a slim margin wreck Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance to the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it\nSo that part I think is it's like a graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation\nIs where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically\nOne of the most common questions I ever receive\nHas to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it\nWho is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably the loudest people in your life that oppose you\nHow's that worked out for you\nOr the angry leftist\nBut you argue politics worth\nYou ever get anywhere you get angry\nDo you think they're one of these folks just poured that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place [noise]\nNow I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they're in our lives and our universe\nBut he wants to be open minded first\nAnd coming up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy [noise] Hi I'm Brian Mann\nThe gray one more global\nListen to what David ask for Illinois has to say about his experience using

opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right\nThey're getting the wage growth\nThe bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this Kavanaugh situation\nTo articulate\nWhat's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of St sexual assault mean that'd be awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad\nRight I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know have it on\nThe anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience so that tells me why\nMark what attracts you to do a show that speak well of you and I wanted to say that ah I live in a very carefully to the who is in a column senator Collins is a [noise] a ... about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a\nQuite impressed by it she laid it out very precisely he was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and build she ... her diligence all the time\nShe had been getting a coming to her up a conclusion all the interview he did and all all the meetings he went to [noise] until I found it very at applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me [noise]\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this\nProcess I mean she\nWas on ... and point by point by\nPoint from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations who are going to oppose regardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't\nEven filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned that even senators got out ahead to one of them even got out ahead of the main being announced when they were saying that they were opposed\nAll the way through\nPoint by point by point\nWind Christine Ford was not credible in terms of her allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims\nNo evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eye she could have been the top of joining in the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them it was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must have view if you\nMissed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating\nAnd again I have never heard a senator deliver a better speech not ever\nI didn't agree with absolutely everything she said\nMoney was principles it was details it was well thought out\nAnd almost everything there was inarguable\nI just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWho goes to go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nHey Brian thanks a lot harder to a premature echo what the last caller showed up about a my respect and admiration for senator callers I mean that's increased by what are the ... girl gr [laughter] for about ten minutes after that I knew her vote was going to be a year\nAnd I'm a sticker driving down the road that you know the only other thing bigger than what Susan calling from food ah today was\nWhen the ... main author Joshua ... protected the ... ... your your army Gettysburg little round top cross preserving the junior so am I really admire her and I'm Glad she do what you did\nWell that's a pretty big moment in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way a how are the folks in in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] oh yeah the skaters are kind of a ramp butter in big bucks a a sort of the cold weather gets in on her I think er I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington\nRobert Charlotte but uh when I was in the marine corps are facing over that area than I've ever read was pretty good they're recovering pretty good for Jacksonville you or your real third areas\nThere all the water repeated in a couple of areas so I talked to a friend over there everything everything back hopefully slowly but surely Beck normal\nAppreciate your service thank you for listening to and sharing your thoughts as well and may God Bless you know the folks there I Lived in Wilmington for a very short time and when I saw what was going on and heard that it was an island are pretty unimaginable so glad that the folks during the get back together after the hurricane in North Carolina All right let's go to\nJake Jake ths in California Welcome to the show\nOh hey yeah yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about work it up ... and Ford and as far as their allegations are concerned but I had all of their for take out I'm not so much\nTo go after her but to ah go after anybody in the future that might think that they can ... people up to putting out false allegations and not have to pay a price\nI think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a pass even though Kavanaugh is going to clear this thing because he's always going to have that stain that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not in\nThat he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe\nThe allegation regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principles\nAnd again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise that should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to the\nBeach and the Judiciary Committee pursue her for perjury at conducting investigation that would be necessary\nTo travel down that path but it doesn't mean that it should go unchecked what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your or none of your witness a\nWere known to win that says period that cooperate any of that information I mean that's a problem that's not acceptable in this country appreciate you are you listening and and checking in\nComing up we'll continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on Brett Kavanaugh on the situation as we get ready for the vote are now under a day away will be approximately five o'clock eastern time tomorrow because at once again this whole process has been much bigger than break out on the Supreme Court it's become about all of us\nWill talk about it next time probably mud and for the great one month\nHim no\nDoubt pollen bearing we
