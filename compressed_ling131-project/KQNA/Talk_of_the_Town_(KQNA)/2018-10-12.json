makes sense about outsourcing our jobs and just remember the black Democrats will say that about you tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read\nThere it is [noise]\nThat's what happens now when Kanye West's was ripping on George Bush after Hurricane Katrina this guy was brilliant\nSo revolutionary mine of the black community this guy was unbelievable he was he was the love of the Democrats white because he was a powerful black man with a lot of talent who was challenging a white president United States of America who clearly doesn't like black people\nBut now oh now you're just to buy new that didn't read\nKanye West\nMet with Trump in the oval office he also talked about his childhood and when he was growing up now again in the ... there's the new line is the president is taking advantage of a mentally ill black man and exporting that black man as a token black man\nOf his racist White House that's the new line that we've seen come out in the last half hour\nKanye West as a black man that can't thing for himself\nAnd and clearly the only reason why I think for himself was because he has a mental issue\nAnd so then the ... the United states of America is abusing this black man and I guess the Democrats than we need to bring you back to the plantation to the mental hospital right\nThat's what we got to do that helps you\nTo know\nYou know\nMy I I Love and he said that he has he was talking about Maggie had his make America great again how you doing my own friends tried to bully me people would come after me they attacked me they threaten me\nThen in a way it gives me power to where the ... of course now that definitely means that he is a negro that they they can't read or doesn't read I guess since that 'cause it's even more insulting if you say the nigger that doesn't really tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read there it is yes yes that's what it is\nHe talks about that how he explains that he likes wearing the make America great again hats he understands that America should be something we should be proud of that we should stand up for that African American job unemployment rates all the time it was a good thing\nAnd then what the last administration was doing was clearly not working\nFor Donald Trump now what a what a terrible person he is exporting this man\nHe is exporting him\nHe is exporting him and he's

place to be literally this kid\nA fishing is on it not on his medicine oh that is horrible he's going against the African Americans um he can't get a break uh it's just it's despicable what to do with the guy now because there's a Trump fan and it's it's horrible but these people do\nIt misses this is the public shaming and the assault which is exactly what he's explain what explains so well\nI mean you you look at the last week he read two celebrities that have gotten into politics right you had you had Taylor Swift who comes out for a Democrat and says she's terrified of Congress woman running for Senate in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and it terrifies her what would she would she would do\nIf she got elected to the U.S Senate\nAnd Democrats came out and said this is a brave independent woman they threw down the woman card right this is what is a brave independent woman she's brave she's a role model every woman should or should have should look at her and teach your children\nAnd your little ... daughters and your and your grandkids to be like hey we're swept because this is what a strong\nBrave role model of a woman looks like them on the west comes out for Donald Trump and now he's a token negro that doesn't read he's mentally ill he's an Uncle Tom\nTerrible and and and the things uh that these guys they say about it it's really really bad I mean it's

I don't think we'll all pull off group like the Democrats will laugh so hard to say that\nWell it was real it was wrong it was unscripted and and and I you know where where the Democrats by the way last week saying that NBC a and inside why do the terrible thing by putting a mentally unfit man on their TV show exporting his popularity\nOr yeah than there were there were nowhere to be found were the last week nowhere to be found me last week was the week that they should have been out there saying how dare you take advantage of Kanye NBC Saturday Night live how dare you put him on stage and his mental state 'cause that's what\nThey're saying today I didn't see anybody at NBC News saying this is what happens\nWhen it when it went a negro doesn't read we take 'em on Saturday Night live Saturday Night live I tell you that's what happens\nYou know you you this is this is what you need to understand this is a year or the educated ignorance\nTo tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read there it is\n\nYou just don't read you don't agree with us we will try to destroy your life and say you need to be in a mental hospital ed you're on the mark of an show than Ferguson we did and I go ahead\nMan this is from Minnesota just up to the city's listen as an African American I'm really really just disgusted by what the Democrats did\nI shouldn't be surprised because sisters are played book [noise] see I like Tania it used to be you know democratic a party believer until I fell off the Democratic plantation just probably three years ago she\nSaid well you don't think in the black community like they want us to think when Tom where sellout were or whatever they want to call us we don't think we can't read but I can read and I understand I understand exactly what's going on\nWhat's going on here is when we don't do what they say they will do it whenever they can to be loved to destroy us to try to uh to make whatever it is that we have to and and make it small I support the president\nI like what he's doing I liked the fact that I'm African American unemployment is as long as it's ever been pretty much I like the fact that we have jobs in our community the nation is driving and I don't like what the Democrats are selling\n[laughter]\nWay I look at the Democrats and I'm like what are they selling\nAnd and I did it I didn't talk about this the other day\nUm with some college kids and I said All right what is it the Democratic party can run on this time ... they they they can't run on the economy being bad right 'cause they're using the party of doom and gloom they can't run on health care\nThey can't run on unemployment they can't run\nThey can't run on unemployment they can't run on on race\nOr an African Americans being left behind or Hispanics being left behind so they have to make it personal\nAnd the way you make it personal is anyone that you don't like you turn them into a racist for a gang rape is Brett Kavanaugh\nYou you turn them into a mental a ... a mentally insane person Kanye West you you turn Donald Trump into some sort of unhinged individual that out of control and can't be trusted with nuclear codes or the economy but you can't say economy more because the economy killing it\nAnd so what you do is the only thing you can run on this time it because you can't fear among right it's hard to fear mongering country\nInto saying you must smoke for us because we're gonna make the economy better that doesn't work the economy's killing it right now and everybody knows that you can't you so so the only thing you do is you have to undermine the legitimacy of the person\nYou have to undermine the legitimacy of Marsha Blackburn intent and Tennessee by the way the Taylor Swift it you know she terrifies me I cannot imagine thought\nA it scares me it makes me want to get in a fetal position because she couldn't attack on the issue so you have to attack or on the I'm I'm afraid of you you you you attack the president the same way you say that well the president's really not in charge of this country if the Russians and they looted together and we're going to sell that until we can't sell anymore anymore and this man needs to be at peace\nAnd then you do the same thing with Kenya and then you don't like the fact that Brett Kavanaugh's when the Supreme Court so you scream and yell and you'd throw things at centers home then you surround them at dinner and you and you look like an angry mob and then you say it's ... it's it's unfair to call this a mob that we are not an angry mob\nBut you are an angry mob and Europe are scary person and I should be afraid of you and everybody else should be afraid of you\nKnow that's what they're running on their running on personal attacks and emotion because there's not a single issue\nThat that the Democratic party can run on right now that they can win on you I mean the main core issues you can't tell us we're in an unjust war and innocent people are dying and we need to come home because we're not in a big war right\nRight right he had that they had that for years that they ran on you know you want to get to that you want to stop spending all this tax money in Iraq or Afghanistan you want to get kids a good education and you want to stop spending money on the fence and stopped seeing these poor boys over to be killed and these women to be killed and census wars you don't have that this time\nRight you're absolutely right\nThat the playboy kids make it personal undermined the individual turned the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh's rail here's my question to you\nLike what you're interrupting regret what we do conservatives and especially if African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide track I\nWell I Am a crafts Democrats I Do believe would have taken control the Senate\nIf it wasn't for them over playing their hand with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I think Democrats are angry they're inspired they're furious and they realize it another four years of a Donald Trump being president could destroy the Democratic party as we know it because if you have an economy that's doing this well\nAnd it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements are being changed and you have American Jobs coming back and you have one in pointed numbers it's extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified but what what I Would say is is that we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive and I think the Brett Kavanaugh is what's going to wake up a lot of Republicans who say that character assassination\nThat character assassination of a good man trying to turn them into the worst thing you can call them and when there's only there's only one thing you could do that would have been worse\nSay that the child rapist that's it right it's child rapist and rapist\nAnd they went all in against Brett Kavanaugh and ... and he was collateral damage it wasn't about it it wasn't about honesty wasn't about fairness it was about a true investigation wasn't it was about trying to destroy a man keep them all the Supreme Court to inspire democratic voters and I think they ever played it I think well hold the Senate and house I really do if we go out and vote\nHad I appreciate the phone call thank you sir it's nice to talk to you by the way I just got back
