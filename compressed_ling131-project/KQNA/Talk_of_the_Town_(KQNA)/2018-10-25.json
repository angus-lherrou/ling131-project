know\nNow why comment beyond that because we don't know anything else and yet that's what's taking place now\nAnd there's something really grotesque about the media in this country\nGoing on and on today about the heated rhetoric\nThat hateful rhetoric because the media in this country understand that they are leading the charge on the heated and hateful rhetoric to you know yesterday alone Donald Trump I counted for four times was compared to Adolf Hitler on MSNBC and CNN\nSix times he was called a racist\nAnd that they they want to have Donald Trump is responsible for the heated and

got a beautiful book out there a terrific book Spygate you tempted sabotage a Donald J Trump I cannot recommend it strongly enough and we will link to it\nAnd I was not on the air when it was released so we'll bring a damn back to talk about it with Dan former Secret Service former NYPD nobody better to talk about this than anybody else you've been watching the coverage what do you make of this\nMarket seems like a very amateur is operation I mean just look at some of the all marks of these devices that were set I mean number one is the obvious one Mark I'm none of them thank God I'm actually detonated it and and explode again thank the lord that happen um but certainly not all\nAnd thank the lord that happen um but certainly not the hallmarks of of of someone with experience in this in this space but\nOther things as Well Mark which seemed to indicate one of only two possible options it was either a really amateurish operation or someone seemingly wanted to get caught um outside of the not detonating also when you look at the photographs we've seen of the devices mark\nYou see a just all march of of of of just the rookie tied ... like excessive postage which is a all I mean it's all over the front of you see the be pronounced hype\nOn the on the label you know if you're trying to create a device into a mail system to God Forbid detonate in front of a male handle or the target\nYou don't use hype that's going to draw attention to the package you see the um one other thing mark they had uh one of the packages was addressed the John Brennan the CNN well\nI mean John Brennan doesn't work at the end and that's quite obvious the basic Internet search would have produced that information he worked at NBC which I mean is it it's really a there's something not right here it's a very suspicious operation very amateurish right now\n[noise] so let me ask you this question is it possible he has such a a devious minded work that somebody wants to look so amateurish\nWell it's certainly possible I said there's only one of two scenarios here I mean either somebody wanted to get caught um for some reason or it's so amateurish that it's ... it speaks to some kind of a you know motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre\nAnd then the the selection of the of the targets um you know of course there's people want to you know if people all over the media right now are given out these ... especially if you go on somebody's other networks who are desperate to prescribe a motive for this would have no idea\nWhat I Would encourage all of them take this very very slow or because I when I when I see a market in my experience in the space especially with the secret service and all of this mail processing system is people who are Syrians who have these Savage animal minds want to do this kind of stuff\nThey are very tactically efficient in the way they do it and none of the marks of tactically efficient up planning where you are in this is a highly highly suspicious or operation I mean none of them even detonated again thank God but that is that\nCertainly doesn't speak to some expertise in this in this space\nTo investigator and you're looking at this I Would think you would make no a imagines a scenario so that you would just try and get the evidence and follow the evidence and try and cigarette out that way rather than\nWhile this mode of that motive and the other mode and you really you you're just getting down to the forensics\nYeah and that's what guys like you when I Do um we're always hesitant to jump to a voter before we actually have the facts\nAnd the data there I mean this is what comments that reasonable people do but of course when you know with the with the current environment and and the media hysteria they immediately want to prescribe them a motive remembered mark the most important of all the W. using this right the who what when where why and how\nThe most important thing obviously is who did it who the actual person it we'd have no we have zero close right now at least publicly as to who that person that I suspect\nKnowing how these investigations go and the availability of the initiate are on these devices which usually leads the signature\nThat they're going to get someone relatively quickly but you have no idea who it is and when you don't have to who you have no idea what the motive is and I got to tell you it's grotesquely irresponsible for these people out there already were absolutely convinced\nThat that that they know exactly why this happened it's just it's it's been Saturday\nYou also find it a really\nGut wrenching sickening that every time there's something a terrible that takes place in this country they trained tied to Donald Trump\nNow rose Donald Trump yesterday was compared to Hitler multiple times on cable TV he was said to be a racist multiple times on cable TV because they use this word nationalism and explain this later in the show\nI'm aware that where it actually comes from comes from the progress has actually comes from Theodore Roosevelt his new nationalism speech but I don't want to jump all getting into that later just shows you how ignorant people are but they were going on and on and and now the same\nHosts the same gas the same contributed call them whenever you will are talking about the rhetoric too hot things need to be coal do they understand the media have led this this this battle with the vicious rhetoric\nMark they've they've accused the man of being a Russian trader a a a guilty of trees and we've had we've had so called air quotes you respected commentators accused the man of treason\nAccusing him of being a Nazi and there you have Maxine Waters and others talking about getting in people's faces mark what other things you\nSean and the people in this industry of always been clear on on the conservative side people are responsible for their own actions that maniac who shot up these police and the baseball field\nI that guy's responsible for his own action but having said that the people who are out they're calling for confrontation and aggressive confrontation and public\nHave to be more responsible but that's not conservative than the fact that they're trying to turn this around immediately and painted on Trump and make it some kind of a political issue without having any of them and how these factors disgusting ...\nOne of the key advisors to Hillary Clinton during a campaign some fringe name sleep whatever his name is this guy yesterday on TV I think it was on TALK shows refuse to condemn people getting into the faces of members of Congress and other public officials in restaurants so it was just yesterday\nI heard it I saw the exact same what you're talking about but that's who he is I just hated him before mark ... who he is I was not surprised one\nAll right my brother well we appreciate having you on then you're great friend God Bless you we'll be right back\nIf you're like most people and you'd see to gas stations in one cell gas for a little bit less you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps but here's what's weird though sometimes we have a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save\nHuge money life changing money if you switch to met his share for your health care it couldn't be massive savings for you the typical savings for a family is five hundred dollars a month\nI think what you could do that over time just doing the math of six thousand dollars a year that\nSignificant and yes people love it and they love it because it works it's believers who share each other's healthcare costs more than four hundred thousand people are now members of medicine here and it's growing like crazy fight on how much you could save\nWe know this president is\nAll I Do want to be precise a congressman you're making comparison between the primary in the United states and Hitler I'm and I want you to explain exactly what you mean 'cause obviously when as soon as this is controversial\nWell what I'm saying is that using the word of nationalism and the national was meaning that you know when you listen to him he was talking about German from the Germans are and that's it I'm On\nAnd Franklin Roosevelt was looking at America for the Americans\n\nThese are historically illiterate human beings that we have to listen to these not alone Max Boot on CNN yesterday cut Eighteen go\nDisturbing historical echoes somebody well now nationalism has meant a lot of things over the years and in the nineteenth century it was primarily associated with liberal movements people I feed\nOur hearts all the founders ... who helped to create a state or federal air boulevard who helped to create those states a Colombian run as oil but on the twentieth century nationalism is taking on a much darker much more negative connotation bingo sort of a sense of fascist movements\nAnd you think of national as to think of people I've Franco and Mussolini I'm Hitler and Pinochet not exactly people at the president of the United states which can be everywhere and that's why it's very hard for me to think of people and he was history called describe themselves as nationalist says not popular term with Kay\nOkay well I'll explain one very big one who was on the twentieth century in a moment and then we have Joe Scarborough really low some\nReally low some individual cut Nineteen do want to read this this is\nKind of a this is who is referencing nobody\nPlease my my love and viewers out there and do not\nDo not draw parallels between what is said here and these anybody\nSo he's doing this to attack Trump\nAnd he thinks he covered by saying don't draw parallels forty be doing just to give us a history lesson on Hitler\nGo ahead isn't that would hurt me\nHurt me very deeply and you don't want to hurt me deeply I don't want to leave on the shows\nThis doesn't relate to anybody whatsoever it's just [noise]\nIt was going through rains and rains and volumes I Love World War two and ... they don't bring Churchill fan love what Rosa\nSo I was reading this this is\nFrom um ah the United states has a strategic services in describing\nThis happened to come across as late as Jim because when you take a Joe Scarborough you think of a historian particularly when it comes to World War two don't you\nNobody sent this to him or put it under as rather huge\n... knows no no he found this on his own go ahead\nBile and this only pertains to Adolf Hitler paints and nobody else I can I just said that enough is enough I mean this is what they have for Adolf Hitler's psychological profile and for those of you in the midst of reading World War two\nA government reports you'll find them fascinating as primary rules were never allowed the public to cool off\nNever admit fault or wrong\nNever seen that there may be some good in your enemy never leave room for alternatives never accept blame\nConcentrate on one enemy at a time and blame them for everything that goes wrong\nPeople will believe a big ally sooner and a little one\nAnd if you painted freon daddy enough\nSo there you have ... comparing Trump the Hitler even though he denies that that's the entire purpose of this\nAnd Don Lemon on CNN cut twenty go\nI'm a nationalist\nJune that we're we're going to talk about that word tonight it is a favorite of All right and is loaded with native is and racial undertones and global as well global is I've been used as a slur\nOf sorts sometimes even against those in the ministry of often with anti Semitic overtone\nOkay now keep in mind user media figures\nThese are hosts\nSome claimed to be reporters\nAnd listen to how they talk it's cooling down the rhetoric is is bringing the country to get is this news isn't even news at all\nThen there's Peter Alexander White House correspondent on MSNBC I'm getting somewhere with this folks please stick with me I Can't do that stuff and quick soundbite cut Twenty one go\nAnd Peter to do also about using the word nationalist that saying you know out loud I Am a national and how does the president have conceive of that term because it doesn't in any way have racial undercount\nRacial undertones racial overtones the word nationalist\nGo ahead\nAnd tell them that are not just racial there there's enough over because this is something that the president and sort of shied away from in the past obviously nationalism was a phrase that Steve Bannon a obviously embrace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to ... you get\nThe draft and there's many others so yesterday\nTrump is compared to Hitler he's a racist he's ... he's all these things\n\nAll the this is the media were the ...\nAll these this is the media\nOr the media using selectively guests to say these things they know what they're going to say\nThe media\nAnd tonight they're out there saying toned down politics as divisive it's to hit\nNow they're reporting and they're not really reporting slowly but surely\n\nI'm not a national is ladies and gentlemen I'm a constitutional is I Believe in Americanism not nationalism [noise] and to correct Max Boot and everybody else who heard speaking\nOne of the leading progressive so the last century progressive he ran as a third party candidate is the head of the progressive party\nWas Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd on August thirty one Nineteen ten those of us who actually do study history Scarborough he gave a famous famous speech\nYou know what in title to speak\nThe new national is\nThe new nationalism\nAnd in this speech the new nationalism Theodore Roosevelt borrowed\nFrom a gentleman by the name or Herbert cruelly if you have my book rediscovering Americanism you know what I'm Talking about\nAnd it's that say\n... famous essay in something called the outlook magazine promise of American Life this had an enormous influence on Theodore Roosevelt\n\nThe progressive movement was really borne out of the Republican Party early on\nAnd it's great leader would become Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd then there's a new nationalism speech I said he called it his new nationalism speech he spoke about the new national as the object of a central government\nThat need for a ubiquitous federal government\nDidn't need to be interfering in the private sector\nA rejection\nOf market capitalism in many respects a rejection of the deck while I'm telling you the truth I rejection of the declaration of independence I has written a rejection of the separation of powers that confine the ability the federal government to help people\nAnd it was on the left\nOn the progressive left new nationalism\nWhy do these people in the media compare Trump to Hitler\nWhat do they call and my race it when he uses the word nationalist the criticism should be\nThat's a progressive term\nThat progressives own work\nIn the twentieth century\nBut Don Lemon is a moron Joe Scarborough is a moron Max Boot as a fake Gregory makes is a moron Peter Alexander the White House correspondent a more on\nThis is a phrase a word\nThat is central to understanding progressive as ... and the central location of the American government they're intellectuals wrote about it all the time\nIs up the president's to be criticized softly\nIt should be using the word out of progressive isn't but no the progressive so run the media for the most part I watch\nThis they want to compare him to Hitler\nHitler\nHitler who rounded up millions and millions of people and slaughtered them", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Talk of
