to watch a radio address I can talk on\nHey we'll get back to live stocks or file a squeaky and Mike I got an update for ya Maria got I got a Boston three yeah the Yankees nothing and the first ... and some guy named mark Tina's hit a three run Homer\nHousing is when you said three nothing that's my finger and I thought I had if I if I had a feeling that Boston might be a little bit ah rusty but not the ... around\nHere is an interesting thing to know the red Sox won a hundred and eight games which is awesome and then you have the Yankees wanting a hundred so you know that it be to my games or what\nWhat have you uh but season series between the two was ten nine with Boston ahead so they were pretty evenly matched and\nThe Yankees and left to post season or seven or no at Yankee Stadium having lost lost the game so what do you have to see today is how Chris sales going to pitch because he was on the radio\nAnd since he's come back like he pitch\nHe was on the radio and since he's come back like he pitched a game against Baltimore or I guess was his last start before the post season it was only throwing Ninety miles an hour and there was a guy that on his average you get set up about Ninety six and he can hit Ninety eight and what have you\nSo people are concerned that his shoulders and fully ill and he's starting a night so that's three run leave them what have you but if he's not on is a game with judge and standing in what have you uh the the Red Sox they need a few more runs than that\nYeah they definitely do because ah he's normally throws Ninety seven was down to Ninety a lot of concern but yeah\nHe got through the first inning and the Yankees\nDid what are the are the red Sox did what they had to do in the bottom of the for so long waiting on every warrior early but uh the mighty Red Sox who we were talking before I went to break how they were one of the top in fact they got to get my numbers in front of me they might be the top\nTeam when it comes to when it came to the teams are for for um pitching the red Sox actually the third best rep third best ER re in the American league but of course the number one batting average\nIn the American league in all baseball with the ... believe it or not whether to sixty eight batting average with the way we bend averages are down so much it was ten points higher than the next best team Cleveland Tampa Bay and even the Chicago Cubs\nSo a good hitting team good pitching team and so far early on first inning three nothing red socks on top of the Yankees in Fenway Park what about the Milwaukee Colorado game any updates there\nAlthough let me look for that but I don't know if you happen to see this I think it was the last game a\nYankees played against Boston you know we before the U.S a this playoff series and what have you know it and John Carlos Stanton hit a home run up into the green monster so some guy makes it pretty good catch up there he's looked at me like I'd say twenty five to thirty is a year or so and so\nHe turns around and he throws the ball back of it wasn't like a really throw the ball back in the field I mean he just got into it and stands going around second base\nAnd the guy hit them and even stand now to smile I mean I was probably the best for oh I don't know if the outfielders on the red Sox could have made that thrill but it was kind of humorous moment because\nWho wasn't afraid and he wanted to be the guy and uh I think he I I bet you if you have maybe only admitted to his brother or if you got um drunk\nBut he probably was really pie or what have you watched the tape and you wash the body language he didn't want to get hit even if it helped the team he wanted to get that base hit the when the world series\n[noise] well it turns out good anyway ...\nBecame the biggest folk law ever ever ever ever I mean bigger and bigger so and I got I got a dog on a dock tell us about\nI Know we're jumping ship here but I got to go see Susan here in the office about something it only took me about three or four minutes but I'm going to let you go off the Arizona Cardinals whatever it may be and we haven't really touched on that we've got to some cardinals or an action tomorrow or not tomorrow but Sunday at one twenty five games on the road\nTwelve o'clock to pre game show All right here on K queuing day\nBut your thoughts about the Arizona Cardinals past present and future going ahead and I'm going to be right back in about three minutes right\nNow is good alright yeah let's talk a little cardinals\nAre right now they're horn for which are definitely is the start they envision or that the fans of vision and uh the quarterback we brought in Sam Brett forever just hasn't really lived up to what we had hoped\nHe would do and I think the original plan was for the number ten pick in the first round Josh of\nA ... Rosen to actually sit for a year maybe like Holmes did with Kansas City learned something from a Bradford and then next year we'd turn them loose well\nOr is he looked pretty good that is to outings out there and uh he did start the game last week against the Seahawks said it could very well been a victory and that's kind of interesting\nI was I was reading something on pro football focus\nAnd doesn't this is following Josh Rosen's first career start we're not going to start you know count that four minutes to an ad against Chicago but he had an eighty seven point one rating for his first career NFL start last week\nThat was the best starting debut for a rookie quarterback since they began this grading scale in two thousand and six\nThat's twelve years so a lot of people are really pretty high on him a lot of people think of all the quarterbacks that were selected in the first round you know from\nA Baker may feel to you know I'm the kid from southern Cal I'm Sam ... what have you that actually Rosen may be that the best guy and the neat thing about him if he is just like how\nEither the mask I and the nice thing about him if he is just like how Seattle had Russell Wilson well you've got them on a contract for four or five years that's very manageable they sign Rosen for\nSeventeen point six million dollars so you divide that by for only for a million dollars a year for maybe your quarterback of the future you're franchise quarterback that allows you to go out and get other pieces for your team maybe similar to defense maybe some wide receivers\nAnd really build up a little mini dynasty that's what the Seattle do because they were able to\nBuild off of Russell Wilson and they just paid them I think a year or two ago but I got four or five years out of Russell and I'd say the cards or or oh bunny are hoping to do that\nAs well with Josh frozen so I was I was impressed with them his numbers would have been even off the charts more I think where Tom Brady had deflate gate where they accused him of letting air out of the balls I think we had inflate Kate because it's above that to errors too much hair in them and they were hard because\nI receivers are dropping balls like crazy\nA I think Jay Jay Nelson dropped the ball would have been a touchdown\nA Christian Kirk dropped a bomb that would've been inside the twentieth uncharacteristically Larry Fitzgerald drop one or two as well so you start throwing those balls in there as completion ins and yards he might have had over three hundred yards passing so I think\nI'm very interested to see how he does we have to decide what's more important that Josh Rosen looks good\nNext to a game which is Sunday or the team wins I like to to see both things happening and right now the forty niners are probably the perfect team for the cardinals to play the forty niners only one in three um I think\nThe team they beat maybe was Detroit\nAnd uh they've lost all their games that were on the road um which was the Vikings Kansas City and then the chargers so\nAt home maybe it'll be a little bit different story of course they lost crop low as their quarterback he had to have season ending knee surgery\nAnd uh they've got a kid from Iowa on CJ bath or who's going to be their quarterback and this is the chance for the cardinals to tee off a little bit\nThey should be blitz scene cause like Chandler Jones on the edges and mark is cold and it should be picking up some facts that need to put some pressure on CJ bathroom because he's\nPretty much a rookie quarterback so let's get in there and do it in the problem that uh we've been having a defense which was supposed to carry this cardinals team\nIf you'll watch running backs that go out side not straight up the mental not north and south but they go outside they've been getting huge gains and so that has to be stopped\nThe forty niners have three offensive lineman that are ... that are probably going to be out for this game so that all should allow our edge Rogers to get in there and maybe stop that running game and get to the quarterback so that's what I'm looking for\nI Hope the wide receiver step up because that's a weakness of this team to a site of Larry Fitzgerald who's been doing much of Christian Kirk looks like he's starting to to get it a little bit but that room of wide receivers need some work\nAnd um that's got to be difficult for roads and then the other thing is David Johnson last week they finally given the ball a little bit I think\nMemory serves me correct maybe he out twenty two touches something\nLike that and they need to get them up to twenty five plus and get them involved in the passing game too because a lot of people don't realize this but he was a wide receiver for a year or two in college and then they realized what they had in him as a running back\nSo he knows how to go out and catch the ball and sometimes maybe you should flank him\nFight them out and they'll make him a receiver make those line backers have to to cover him so that's what I'm looking for as well and I think this is a chance or\nThe cardinals to get their first when [laughter] and let's hope that they do we don't want to go over and five so\nIf I had to make a prediction on this game and uh definitely don't go to ... one or Las Vegas with my predictions but if I had to I'm going to go with the cardinals I think those games will be a low scoring affair I don't see us lighting up it's probably gonna be an ugly game in many many ways\nI'm looking for like a Twenty one to\nTen Twenty one to fourteen when for the cardinals left to see how that works out\nAnd one of the reasons I'm saying that to Josh Rosen impress me with is poised and he was able to if there's a rush it can get away from that a little bit and ... for you know he had a pretty much looking at his first target an and launched the ball where\nI'm rose and doesn't have to do that and I was kinda surprised how where he seemed confident he was\nAnd he really throws a nice ball so uh we'll see what can happen heavy blitz by the cardinals on San Francisco ... quarterback and then hold down they're rushing\nAnd then turn David Johnson lose and especially the sides rushing the ball get him involved and receiving the ball as well and I think the cardinals should come back one and four so up to see what Mike He thinks\nA prediction wise and what have you but that's how I see this came going\nAgreed doc I'm here and uh when you listen to you and agreed San Francisco's favorite my four and I'm thinking Arizona plus the four points yeah and with rows and I think that's something they might be able to pull off like you missed some of the injuries the over under was forty one it's down to forty people are betting the under I'm very tempted except for the fact\nThat ... and even though Arizona doesn't score San Francisco's been in some scoring they've scored a hundred points given up a hundred and Eighteen\nSo that's where I Would be wondering worry marine and wondering if they're going to be having some ah some points put on the board or whatever but you know they've got their quarterbacks her and things like that now San Francisco is one and over and home we've only had one home game and they wanted\nTheir own three on the road because every one in three overall so as bad as San Francisco kind of is Arizona and being on for with new coaches and the and you know hey at some point there sooner is going to figure it out and their line and everybody's going to figure it out\nYou know it's one of those deals where when you've got a bunch of ... and that their rookie but when you got a team with a bunch of rookies every game let alone for games can really help you well these guys are all somewhat new new coaches all that but every game\nIs a great learning experience and they learn more and become more as one\n... the is brought you the season by her show\nBrown bag murder rescued belly heating and cooling\nCowboy country oh do you feel\nAt least it was the Saturday it's already been I mean I can you do belly and Ninety five for the rest of alliums got us\nWhether there's a car

welcome back that was a little bit of doc rock I'm object nicknamed after all these years yeah docket rocks\nThat's Grammy material of yes\nWell maybe if you're the dead of the guys just rock band that singing that even though it ruins accomplice was pretty big in their day down in the Phoenix area in Tempe and used over for Jimmy world and I think they're still kick around once in a while but the good stuff and uh that's all about doc doc and let's talk sports\nAnd let me give you a little they look interesting chips and things kind of a funny ESPN all of us each week comes out with this and F. L. power ratings and they write all the teams and the NFL or the you know the west\nYou know for our division is interested in the number one team they have rated in the NFL the LA Rams we just got to\nTalk to a little bit about that right I think I'd have to go along with the rams have been pretty impressive all this week there's a new number thirty two team the worst rank team in the NFL and that's your Arizona Cardinals who move [laughter]\nSo what what they say is a rookie snaps leader of offensive lineman Mason called the rookie center auto Michigan\nHe has played a hundred and Ninety eight out of a hundred and Ninety eight snap so that's a hundred percent it says a third round pick out a Michigan has yet to miss a nap on offensive line that has allowed only two sacks\nSense fellow rookie Josh Rosen took over the starting quarterback job\nSo that'll neutral I was saying before where Sam rap for once he was there he was there Rosen can get away a little bit he can make guys missed so he can extend plays and that's a huge advantage in the NFL he's not like\nRussell Wilson worries and I whipped off twenty yards or whatever but he can get you a good age yards or you can find maybe the third receiver and the progression or sand Bradford I think it was always drawn to number one so anyway you're Arizona Cardinals\nAre number thirty two out of thirty two teams and the team they're playing the forty niners for some reason or number twenty seven\n... one of the only thing the only thing are correct John doc correct you on is this isn't the first week that's three weeks in a row\nThat they've been though I thought we were next to last last\nWe know when I guess that's one thing I grabbed was my on my USA Today remember I was just flying in from overseas and I got an a case of\nThis is the ESPN writing\nMaybe oh okay well the u._s._a. today maybe they are more with the u._s._a. today and it was even the Europe edition but the u._s._a. today that I bought in Germany or in Prague or somewhere along the way had them thirty second last week and it showed them the week prior to that thirty second so they are even more with it\nThey they've been thirty seconds for three weeks in a row and I don't think they were much higher than that the\nEuropean edition that they don't even know what football is well yeah they well they they they think they have a different football will they actually\nPlay football with their feet and it's all the fun of the Americans because we play\nFootball basically with our hands and rarely kick the ball so but anyways we've had this discussion before I got to throw this out and then you're right I think the cardinals are going to do just fine against San Francisco I like it or maybe of San Francisco was healthy and they had their real quarterback I wouldn't be so hopeful but this could be a a real\nThey had their real quarterback I wouldn't be so hopeful but this could be a a real good game to bet and take them plus the points and here's another reason\nI don't know if you brought this up or somebody else I was talking to the other day out of senior softball is the schedule and we're talking a little earlier in the show but she had a tough schedule and there will tested yet they're you know to into and ready to go in there and beat the Twenty one ranked Colorado or whatever who's played nobody but a bunch of wanting sixteen team\nWell you look at the teams that the cardinals fed to play the Redskins three in one\nTwo and one I guess 'cause I got the Monday Night game ah ramps for now number one and the whole power it bears have been just not just a surprise but like awesome and their three in one a sea hawks or two into and probably could be better they are they're really solid team so add it all up\nThe four teams that the kernels of played or Lebanon for Lebanon for so they've been playing some really tough teams and they've had some you know they almost beat the bears course they choked it off they were right there back and forth with Seattle of course the first two games are not competitive they got their butts kicked by\nWashington and the rams but they've played teams or Lebanon for and our city three of those teams are sitting in first place in the NFC\nSo they're not losing to bad teams are losing the good teams and they're probably going to play a bad team so the problem\nWas that they were even you know no matter who you are playing when you're a scoring the amount that they were ah it wasn't good and they were allowing a lot of points on our defense and then for whatever reason\nAnd the coaches and I don't understand it they weren't having David Johnson touch the ball much so I think those things now are changing and that will help them as well but you're right yeah that's really an interesting thing out of the teams that they've lost to have a good record so that's encouraging right there\nYep that they've ah you know they're not they're not losing a bad teams are losing the good teams and here they finally get to play a bad team is injured\nWell I'll tell you this though the one victory for the forty niners was Detroit they're horrible or their role losses they've lost the Vikings good team they lost to Kansas City good team they lost to the chargers that's a pretty good team too so that I you know I Know that are what their regular but it's probably pretty good to\nKansas City for no charges or two into and you mentioned a Vikings\nVikings who aren't doing quite as well as they thought because they've but they're one two and one so some similarities there the San Francisco is played some pretty good teams they beat Detroit who's one in three what are the injuries I I like this game this actually is becoming\nToo um I'm about ready to head up the last winter uh do a little speed dial it some of my buddies and take the cardinals plus for\nNot sure if that's come down a little bit but ah it looked like cardinals plugs for over under his forty one and and I am I'm not I'm not convinced the under the best bet because the cardinals could put a whole bunch of points I think it's going to be that's going to be a little more iffy that could go either way and you when you said twenty something to\nSeventeen or whatever so I don't want anyone to tend to forget that might be too close for comfort I'm starting to like Arizona plus four and I gotta feeling even forty niner fans might not be showing up and grows\nUp there with a you know what's what's with the injuries and being one in three\nMen and they have to travel so far to get to that new stadium one uh we were there we saw the last week for the cardinals at Candlestick Park which was they were getting ready to close it\nAnd we talked to a bunch of fans that were really complaining about I think it's out near San jose\nThe new stadium or Santa Clara I'm not sure what they were not happy that they would have to drive or take over or whatever to get out to the to the new stadium so maybe that will keep fans away I Do have one interesting thing for Larry Fitzgerald fans\nIf Larry gets one reception just one\nHe'll have a hat or at least one reception that two hundred and sixteen consecutive games and that's the second longest streets them streak in NFL history", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Talk of the Town (KQNA)", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "06"}
