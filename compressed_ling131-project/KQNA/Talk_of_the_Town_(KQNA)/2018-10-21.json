the can down over there and I'm In this is it's a big one a anybody who's saying this is the most important election of our lifetime or is it just blowing it up your you know\nYou know what's a ... they say that every time\nAnd it it starts to sound ridiculous and people on television in Manhattan and inside the beltway here in DC they start to sound history on like\nA ... and it's all a reason to sort of try to inspire their base I suppose to step forward if not the most important election of your lifetime\nUh but but it's important for the next two years\nBecause of the Democrats do when the majority in the house we're looking at obstruction even more so than what you've seen we're looking at the resistance movement holding the gavel in the speaker's chair and in ... chairman share of every single committee\nYou're looking at impeachment you're looking at investigations [noise]\nFor as far as the eye can see your looking investigations of the Trump Administration and the Republican Party and conservatives in this country in general I and if you don't believe me if you think I'm speaking in hyperbole\nListen for a moment to one of the shining lights of the Democratic party probably this guy's going to be a running for president he is on the intelligence committee he's Joaquin Castro he's a congressman he's a Democrat he's on the intel committee which means that Democrats taken very seriously\nI this this used to be a committee that that you know transcended party it was about the most important sensitive information that this country or could ever waded into\nA ... that that it it shows no politics there's no red there is no blue there's just red white and blue on the intelligence committee and then the Democrats brought us Adam Schiff as the ranking member\nBut let's take it a little further I mean I like to defer to you on the state's seven seven three one three eight one one I liked the Democrats produced mobs\nRepublican produce jobs but let's look at this thing in a uh entire holistic way shall we let's look at exactly what the next two years are going to be like with investigations with impeachment\nWith the impeachment of Kavanaugh that they're promising with the obstruction with the resistance with the impossible task of this president this administration getting anything done at all\nWith Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the house if you were advised Republicans right now if you were advised in your local congressman right now to come up with some kind of message to flip those votes the people who still aren't sure how they're going to go\nTo warn them off of what our next two years will be with the Democrat majority in the house how would you make that argument if you were sitting across from your brother in law who isn't sure how to vote if you're sitting in the cubicle next to your co worker and they're not sure how to vote if you're exchanging ideas on your Facebook right now\nAnd you're trying to persuade them what argument are you making right now is it Dems produce moms\nRepublicans produce jobs is that is that the good approach [noise] uh what are you doing right now eight seven seven three one three eight

Wisconsin Josh here next up on the market within show I'm Larry O'Connor\nHi Larry how are you I'm good I I'm concerned though because if the Democrats do get the majority in the house this is going to be a rough two years\nAnd I have an idea I'm Talking to your street car and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show in Detroit when it's ran by businessmen like Donald Trump say in Henry Ford and the strength that Detroit once had and then what Democrat liberal take over\nAnd all it just falls into corruption in squalor and just show them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they'd on how they ...\nIf you let politician fake over you get your choice if you let Republicans take over and have ideas you get Foxconn any doodle for jobs that we're getting a shock that I yeah I Wish that more and more and more and they don't\nYeah and I you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great job than it is an incredible turn around what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been phenomenal\nYeah at least some Scott the number and Madison there were all yes that matter and that took on our capital and we fought right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that ... is the second half of the terrible Donald Trump if it if we fight the good fight and vote on November ... that'll happen\nThank you Josh thank you for the call I appreciate it thanks for calling into the market within show ya I vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of the Scott Walker or the governorship but that was back when I was working with Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Andrew got on a plane\nThe next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison\nIn the winter in Southern California guy who asked her why are you going in Madison looked at what's going on there look at the mobs look at the riots look at the ... ... look at Scott Walker needs us Republicans need us conservatives who are trying to bring sane rational\nGovernance to the state of Wisconsin need us and he sure did go there by the way right next door to you there are Josh over in Michigan this is a remarkable thing\nYou know everywhere you go right now on cable news broadcast news all over the Internet who do you hear about running for Senate this young upstart appealing good looking guy\nWho's who's a define the odds and has a real chance to win all you're hearing about is this guy data work they don't work doesn't have a chance to win a Texas better and better work is not going to win\nThe Senate seat in Texas\nAnd it's all made for TV we've seen this game before every two years every election they tell us about the new rising star in Texas was finally going to take paint Texas blue you know when Hillary Clinton\nWas a deciding not to do any sort of polling or appearances in Wisconsin Pennsylvania will not Pennsylvania she did appears\nIn Wisconsin or Michigan\nOr that she was actually at that time\nContemplating spending more money in Texas because she was so sure she was going to win Texas and Georgia in Arizona and she ... she wanted to to this was going to be a transformative election with Hillary Clinton and the remaking of the map\nWe hear this all the time but it's not true and meanwhile in Michigan there's this guy John James last poll\nShowed him in single digits now this guy a running against Debbie Stabenow I mean he is he's a former military [noise] uh the the combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues are they here I Want to play a little bit of of him because because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing that's fake narrative that the Democrats are really you know I've been to the Texas is moving blue Texas is going to be a democratic state Texas is not the same Texas because it does\nThis is not the same Texas because the Democratic demographic changes because the because of all of the radical conservative policies that have heard that they would have it I mean\nPeople are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas because of the economy there is one of the only state to persevere through the eight and ... years of Brock Obama because they had Republicans in charge of that state there's no way that people are Texas would reverse that trend but also because I hate Ted Cruz\nThe media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're pumping this beta will work guy up and meanwhile listen I got a little bit of a John James this a really impressive guy in Michigan\nReal leadership is what's needed in Washington in order to ensure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity American exceptionalism is not entitled\nAmerican exceptionalism his sons\nThere was a time in America we still don't always right without any sort of political motivation of reservations we waste wars on equal amount on each other services for self we they're greatly policemen wisely we love deeply in a man's world was on this is what our president means when he talks about making America great\nAre you kidding me about dreaming I mean do you hear this guy about doing the heartening African American young handsome odd articulate as as a perfect on the issues perfect on his love for this country full support of the president\nI mean I come on if he if he were running against Ted Cruz do you think we hear more about John James\nIf he were a Democrat do you think we'd be hearing a little bit more why why is everyone obsessed with better work when he was basically running\nJustice far behind to cruise in the latest polls then John James is running behind Debbie Stabenow\nAnd you know the answer to that question you know very well the answer to that question\nHow about GM down in a hurry men do Florida I'm Larry O'Connor you're listening to the mark within show what does a gym\nI just don't want to tell you what the Democrats or Republicans should be talking about yeah\nIs what the Democrats are not talking about gun control the economy jobs unemployment people for one in case you know the media is driving a narrative and they're doing that in the pocket of the Democrats\nYet Jim you're right all the Republicans need to know what they should be talking about in the next to the two and a half weeks you're absolutely right all the things that the Democrats are avoiding and that includes the fight over judge Kavanaugh now justice cabin on notice how no one talks about that anymore it's completely disappeared why do you think that is Jim\nOh geez I Wonder that because the media is driving it there are saying okay well that's not important anymore because that might make the the conservatives rushed to the animals and you know [noise] disregard they're what they're what they're trying to do\nThank you Jim appreciate the call thanks for calling the ... I got a little bit more in fact I Want to play a little bit more of this guy John James he has not gotten enough national exposure or I Know that all the great listeners on an W. J. are out of Detroit Michigan my hometown my birthplace where I'm originally from\nAh I I Know you know about this guy but at the time we gave him the national exposure that he's not getting\nFrom broadcast and cable here's a limit on play a little bit more of this great great candidate John James for Senate\nIn Michigan and I'm going to juxtapose that with Cory Booker\nCory Booker another rising star in the Democratic party Spartacus oh he's our great hope for twenty twenty he's running against Donald Trump and he's young he's handsome and he's articulated he's African American he he's everything that John James really is\nIs what they claim Cory Booker is and I want to play you these two side by side\nThat the John James message bit is lost right now and the Cory Booker message that they just can't get enough of", "show_name": "Talk of the Town (KQNA)", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "21"}
