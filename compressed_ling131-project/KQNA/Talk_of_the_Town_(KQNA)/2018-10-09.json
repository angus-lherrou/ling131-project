I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president Utah I I don't remember one of those George Bush ...\nListen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond not trying to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was the secret service agent ... I'm not being hyperbolic I mean that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we add Medicare part D I like George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nIn fifth thing he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis that's like saying that's like me coming out and saying to you\nHey Barack Obama was a moderate out he was that he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your point your point is that the economy went south under George W Bush because of conservatism now\nLet me ask you a question if you don't mind\n... like an assertive ideal whether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy caused that recession\nOne work deregulation\nBob how how exactly do you figure that when deregulation or the repeal of Glass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\nThe bank where all deregulated ... you're actually right 'cause I I I mean\nI Know I'm right but but the reason I'm right to find this number one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one\nThe number one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one and number two oh tell me the commercial banks that went under because liberal site this talking point often they said was deregulation and it was the splitting of investment banks from commercial banks so I always say to them okay well explained to me what commercial banks want under as a result the recession I\nDon't have out here without all the problems with the stock market and the mortgage industry and allowing\nCalled ... I I we can't get past the first for me and you have a back and forth you can't just bypass uncomfortable question\nYou said that it was a conservative president that had the last recession I disputed that it was a Republican president now at what I'm trying to suggest you with the recession was not caused by what you said it was caused by and I'd like you to acknowledge that the deregulation happened under Clinton that's just the fact\nThat well the last now in the coffee or right was under Bill Clinton and it happened for many years before that because what happens is when you have regulations right what happens is the the in suing administration left and right who were bought and paid for by special interests over the decades years in\nDebt yeah but but but Carl your point you're making isn't even true I'm asking you if the deregulation\nThat commercial back to the the skill some of the commercial and the majority of the commercial me investment banks was the cause of the recession then what commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because there there there there's no way of sort of do it\nSo I was an article on that it's all day because it's it's a walkie talkie on what the audience to that I'm just trying to make the point you I appreciate your call though don't hang of it\nI I think you're a reasonable guy\nI just wish that whereas I can criticize some of the the policies by George W. Bush I thought were wrong I Wish you'd open your eyes to you can't just throw out something like oh deregulation that Bush was terrible and then not follow up at all and present any facts and data that's totally irresponsible that's not what happens\nIf you see what what happened is under Bush right at the very end of his ... year in power when everything fell apart just prior to Obama being elected All right\nCarl listen I gotta run we're up against the break I'm Sorry but listen thanks for the call but sorry folks that's not what happened I could go on about this all day\nWe we lost because we had we added a cheap money problem we had a bunch of GS these government sponsored enterprises in Fannie and Freddie than incentivize people to buy homes they simply could not afford that was the genesis of the housing crisis that ripple through the economy\nMaturity mismatch is it was a very simple problem to observe looking at it in retrospect and claiming it was a massive deregulatory after that happened other Clinton therefore the Republicans caused a recession I'm Sorry is just completely utterly absurd\nAll right up there but you know in from work when I got to take a break we'll get to some other callers I promise you eight seven seven three one two three one month we'll be right back [noise] month\nHim make\nYour data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and sharing your information these are legitimate companies but they are putting you at risk and now you at in all the crux since cameras and the risk of ID theft it's insane look the best thing you can do is protect yourself and your family it's why I switched my\nId care for identity protection they're the best in the business for playing starting from less than ten dollars a month and only my id care offered say one hundred percent money back\nRecovery guarantee you can sign up at my id cared dot com slash mark my id care has taken care of fortune five hundred companies for years but now\nThey're protection is available to people like you and me and you my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my id cared dot com slash marks enter promo code mark learn more and then let my id care take care of you my id care dot com slash Mario Cuomo called mark that's my\nId care dot com slash marks enter promo code mark", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Talk of the Town (KQNA)", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "09"}
