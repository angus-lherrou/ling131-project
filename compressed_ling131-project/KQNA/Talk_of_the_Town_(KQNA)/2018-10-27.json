Africa One taking the day off but I guarantee he will be back friday\nNext friday mad dog all the ... billion barrel pushing the button that you've got dark night 'til six will keep you abreast to all the happenings in the world series game first pitch coming up for about ten minutes are we doing pretty much a pre game show going over all the ins and outs doc I don't know if I ever put you on the spot\nBefore we get to the interview at local kids ski who do you think's gonna win tonight's game I think I told your biggest thing or at least the better I think the Dodgers are gonna win it they're basically a tutor one favorite I feel is anybody's game only because\nOf all the things we pointed out what the Red Sox how dominant they are how great a the American league was this year how the red Sox have already gone through a couple of hundred hundred and four when teams are nine and two so if anything I'm probably leaning towards the red Sox but it is at home\nIt's you know a whole different whole different coasts over here in Los Angeles a viewer against ports L O G H actually know da a different lineups out there\nWho do you think's gonna win tonight's game three match up in the world series\nI'm going with dealer and Larry King heckling the red Sox hitters\nLarry King the guy that looks like a snake well of\nCourse you know you know the gals name she gave her credit are very very hard she's every game she's a real true fan so she'll be there too but we'll see a flurry shows up but up first off\nI'm Still going with the Curt Schilling thing which of noise me so I'm going with the Dodgers and being at home I think it's going to help them a little bit and hey just like you said we were you you and I were had chase and then we went to New York one of the few people a\nSense stations that did and we saw to victory at home than we went on the road and the Yankees took three straight and diamond backs came back and fortunately they add Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson to to sew up the world series so I think it's not all of the question that the Dodgers are\nCould make this a series after all the red socks look very formidable but I'm going with the Dodgers tonight\nI'll go with the red Sox and you're talking about a year or something like the old one World Series where you went to\nAll the home team won two and two and yeah it was only three back in New York and then to when they came back at the same thing happened uh they got land in Minnesota and Ninety wander so Kirby Puckett it was all the home or a series or so we'll see what happens here you and I\nGosh in the last Twenty years or so we've been at probably\nFifty sixty Seventy percent of these things I was hoping to be in LA\nToday calling in but just didn't work out but it will be like everybody else enjoying it on a on the tube and for those that can't third drive and we'll keep you abreast of what's going on again there's no local coverage I think up in the valley are up in the\nQuad city's snow no radio broadcasts course we would have the ... we always played the diamond backs when they're out in the world series games with a force it didn't happen this year so uh\nWe will get the hell you mentioned merry heart and Larry King and all those kind of people there's about a week late but a lot of people were asking me about the gal in the front row in Milwaukee who was sitting next to them Marlin man who'd they weren't together Marlin man has his own crazy Marlin man\nAnd he has his own problems and issues and the more or less to like I'm ... now Milwaukee guy and he wanted to give them a quarter million dollar as person seat in Miami but they wouldn't do it Bob la but anyways the gal was sit next to him a lot of people noticed because she has a low cut shirt on but she is front row and Amy\nAnd ... at the brewers games\nIt is a true fan she keeps store she cheers and drives down from Osh Kosh Wisconsin to\nTo Milwaukee and it tends to lead a season ticket and she turns at least fifty games a year and she was there all those playoff games so case you're wondering who that gal was because I tell you a dog a lot of people ask me who is it\nOne or two that gal was you tell your dog a lot of people ask me who is this girl she just some groupie or a ball player's girlfriend or whatever but she was a huge Milwaukee Brewers fan you know what I'm Talking about by chance\nNo I don't know left to notice up the next time well\n... it's ... he's done but most people noticed this girl was hard not to issue with the right or she would be like we're merry heart sits in LA too you're watching the batter to the right jeeze a little bit to the left\nAnd then the screen a lot a lot of people noticed her low cut a outfit so to speak and how she was just some bimbo but she actually is a huge Milwaukee Brewers fan and\nAnd you can see you're keeping score enough there a baseball coming up we'll keep you posted in the meantime we mentioned on the first hour how hot the comedies are ... there was the hottest team right now in Arizona they want to back to back games or to one\nHad a NICE Road trip they've got a game tomorrow they just couldn't beat in Vancouver fantastic third period a good again tomorrow against Tampa Bay all the action can be heard I Believe right here on K queuing age\nFor for that action in it so I Would say it's a six o'clock was double check six o'clock against Tampa Bay and then they have a game also Tuesday at home against Otto at seven o'clock they can pick up some points between these two teams not\nEasy Tampa Bay is a pretty good team but they can pick up some points they hot day you can almost say they're right back in there and sort of going for that number one draft pick they might be going for a playoff spot there really planned well and uh you know in the crowds then okay and there'll be even more as the snowbirds show up hopefully\nThey'll have a ring to play in next year but for right now doing good and you caught up to one of our favorite guys Luca Pinsky tell listeners a little bit about Luke and they go ahead and set up this interview\n... of course he's with the euro zone a coyote radio network and a few listen in he's even been doing some play by play stuff with them as well you know these are also do some of the shows\nFor the cardinals after their games in ... which which probably is a pretty tough gig but he's popping up all over the place and I'm\nI'm sure there's a lot of local a talk show hosts around here that are a little worried because he's very articulate he knows all the sports and I'm not really like Luke a lot so let's rule of thumb loophole Pinsky\nMy I think he's just said it I mean there's there's so much up in the air right now and all of a sudden these last nine weeks mean a lot I think for the the franchise in general because if things don't get at least a little bit better then you have to wonder if you're keeping the Wilkes if they do get better then you can and if we can make my points they maybe he was the majority of the issue so\nYou know we got Josh frozen you got all these these young pieces coming through you don't want to be changing coaches every other year so they they've got the decision to make your over these final couple of months of the season this weekend\nI just I kind of feel like you know the cardinals here at home they're playing the one team they seat and this year Josh Rosen is\nHe's he's better than than Bradford I mean that's the way it is and and I I think that he thinks it's better than they showed on Thursday night game against Denver but I think the witness games I I think that there's gonna be a sense and you get out there and the seals where you can\nYou can put that last game behind you you can put the first frustrating seven weeks behind you could put all the Patrick Peters and stuff this week at the end the Mike McCoys up you can kind of put all that of your mind to go out there and just ... and sort of distance yourself from it\nI think that they're going to be motivated by the release of that more than anything else\nAnd I know like I tell my in those a lot of that's the one thing that worries me is of they didn't really blow San Francisco away even though they got five term or so I'm not sure if they're going to get five turnovers again now here's the other thing to look and I are both uh\nHey you guys and what have you and it's been sort of disappointed I mean I guess you can say for losses I Will just a touchdown and I'd sort of see the W. use or what have you instead of falling back on that scenario but they're going to be playing southern Cal at the coliseum I think they're\nFour point underdog something like that or how do you see that again going and it's probably it's a must win for both teams actually if they want to do anything bowl game wiser content in the south or what have you so what do you think the devils chances are this weekend\nYou and I have talked about this this team a lot of the year I'm I've gone back and forth with them this year because I you know the season started I was just I'm just hoping they'd get the six when I was hoping for six ... six get some ... ability your first year with ... and and you\nYou know you can everybody's looking at your nationally and you can go out there and and win six games against a pretty tough schedule then they started out the way they did and they beat Michigan State you start degree and you're thinking maybe seven or eight when I'm you know\nThere's the reasonable part of me is\nHappy with the fact that they're in all of these games like you're going to USC this weekend I think the costs and we'll have a chance to win\nBut you know the guy that went the ASU that that version of be\nLike you said wants to see some W's here at some point and um you know they've lost what now or of their last five at a certain point it's not good enough to just be in the games but I Do think for a year one of this whole project ... as long as as long as they're in these games and and they find a way to win a few of them you know I still have it\nJames and and they find a way to win a few of them you know I still have to compromise expectations a little bit ... seems to have to go in there and when I think too I just want to see them coming out one of these these clothes losses into aware\nCome with you and you know maybe quarterback many welcomes will come through a little and from what I've been reading\nA southern Cal is down to like a third string quarterback 'cause they're highly touted freshman like just Daniel says his last name I may have that wrong but you're going through a concussion protocol so he may not play that might even\nOut the playing field right there I guess what disappoints me and I'll probably talk about this on the show a little bit too as\nThe hunter utilization them to kill Henry I still\nDon't understand that at all when you got a weapon like that and you know he's not going to be your next year I mean you got to get that through the ball but not enough of my standing on my little preachers a stool or so and I think we've probably feel the same about that well the hockey stuff\nAs usual is great and um you know we do carry all the coyote games as well as the cardinals and the diamond backs to so everybody knows who ah local ... plus somebody I really appreciate your joining them in the fans\nSounds good thanks a lot [noise] All right we've talked to assume maybe I'll see you I'll see what some game at some point alright\nYep thanks live right\nThere we go Luke Lipinski and of course I meant to say the keel Harry not in the ... Henry I don't know where that came from\nBut it just shows that live radio but Lugar's grade as usual I think it really makes this point as well as speaks well and there's no ... what have you so what'd you think on his takes on the coyote like well\nWe'll get to that and a second because I Do want to go on that but first off on the world series or not missing much yet three of ... down the a Red Sox are three like I said three batters up three down viewers throwing Ninety eight to a hundred\nAnd doctors will be coming up here in the bottom of the first uh you're you're right Larry King is there is actually Larry King\nVery hearts husband and then merry heart so\nThey're All right there together where he couldn't stand up when they were cheering fact Mary said now but the husband stood up so uh Larry King is there\nAnd I'm sure there'll be other celebrities and a place looks rocking abuser so far doesn't look too much like a rookie got um three of three dollars shoot at the doctors can do back to what Luke had to say a number one would be the coyotes were going to get to the football here in a second you and me coyotes I'm a believer too and only because\nWell we talked about earlier they've been playing very well they've been out shooting teams they didn't get the victories and despite all that they're four and five\nAnd if they would have maybe had two of those games go their way which they could've because they were out shooting teams big time playing pretty well and it's even being a little shorthand now they're getting healthier they could very well be six and three and six and three that's what their first place in the Pacific division so it\nThey're only four points out as it is from the first place Vancouver three points out from San jose in Anaheim\nSo they're in the thick of things locked independent what they do tomorrow night against Tampa Bay Tampa Bay coming in a very good team there six one in one and then there next game will be Tuesday at home or at least they're home games in Ottawa not bad for three in one so we'll see if they're for real what they can do there I think there's a very competitive team I think they do have a chance to the playoffs\nAnd their gold tenders are doing well ah what you guys alluded to in the conversation is ran by how the ... one towards the end that was because he was healthy when he wasn't healthy and they didn't have a very good backup goalie they had some problems\nSo uh Arizona Coyotes or for real and alive and unlike some of the other teams in the valley could get it done I Know we're heading up to the break but you were talking football and I want to get to the pack twelve stuff with you in the last quarter of the show\nAnd the next thirty minutes but when it comes to an NFL number one there was a game last night Houston took care of business unlike\nLast Thursday's home team which was Arizona Cardinals who got their butts kicked forty two to ten\nI was out there for that mess but Houston did get it done throw me five touchdowns and they posted to a forty two twenty three when so Houston took care of Miami or we are going to definitely get into the left which is the new\nOffensive coordinator be at the Patrick Peterson back office trade DiMaggio leases method that he did have some trade demand will get docks maybe points or thoughts on that I Will talk definitely some cardinal football\nAlso want a little weird side note and ... and you document alerted me to this an ... player Chad Kelly who was actually here in the valley is the backup quarterback for the Broncos yup he um\nI don't know drinking crazy this guy went to a party ended up at a neighbor's house or the party on their couch at midnight scaring the crap out of these people he was arrested on suspicion of criminal trust past Tuesday he's been let go\nBy the Broncos which means third year pro Kevin Hogan is now the backup to Casey Kasem\nAnd they've actually signed Garrett racing as their practice squad quarterback so a real quick yeah exist you brought up to me your thoughts 'cause I I mean as weird as it sounds to me and obviously the guy's got a drinking problem or some sort of substance problems is Chad Kelly he\nI mean it wasn't like he showed up naked or killing anyone he foolishly went into these people's house drunk or high out of his mind and sat on their couch but\nIt's something the NFL can doesn't like you know they don't have to have a court hearing they can just say listen you you're done at least done for that team but your thoughts on ... which is a little embarrassing thing is it Jim Kelly is like nephew right\nYeah it was and he's had nothing but problems now he he basically broke into those people's house I mean they didn't know and it wasn't like he went oh there's my neighbors and uh I guess life was with a little child on the couch sit there and then he came in and sat right next to her started mumbling that\nFinally the husband how to take apart is vacuum cleaner and heat on him on the ... not a lot of the house then they called the police\nAnd the police scoured the neighborhood and the two blocks down they found him in ... in an SUV just parked there are kind of maybe Tony La Russa style I'm not sure but he's had problems all along he was a pretty high recruit a what the Clinton and he was a four star high school recruit he had a\nProblem there arguing with the coaches and tell him he was a liquid if he wasn't named the starter and blah blah blah so basically they kicked him off the team and then he\nI think when he went to a whole mess he actually got in a fight or I don't know if it was you know there are some a bar or whatever it was some police officers so that didn't help things up for him at that old miss either\nYou buy my model do all the rage on Capitol you can tell you we're going\nTo me why they wouldn't let us know why the ability to go with you and I\nCame out here and ... are you interested in buying a home and just have a million questions running through your head to change team at Wal Kimball mortgage here twenty four hours a day seven days a week ... even if you need to meet on Saturday morning because of your work schedule\nWill be there called the change our team that for four or five eight seven three zero wall ... mortgage lucky here and there when you mention I find ones in each of them are equal opportunity like\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nWelcome everything's perfect but I can let me stop my foot from tapping okay go ahead and we've been over we've been over playing that but dock has been filling in like crazy Sanford going has been taken a week or two or three you off but he will back mad dog going to be back next friday\nIn the Three Stooges will be reunited meantime you've got me my costs with Dr Iran as the song\nSays and bill Monroe pushing the button and a World Series nothing has happened yet nothing nothing nothing it is a Red Sox went down one two three in the first Dodgers did not score and the bottom of personalities the top of the second two outs and the red Sox have nothing going so this was looking like\nPotentially a pitching match up yes between ... cello and a beauty or who's been drawn Ninety eight hundred\nSo what can be posed reading habits we now in six and it was like the red Sox are going down one two three again so bottom of the second zero zero in the world series game three dogs taking the Dodgers I took the red Sox\nAnd we'll see how that plays out before we get docked takes on the Arizona Cardinals won last side note I set a producer whisper in my ear something about it'd be nice to get to some of our picks probably give you a pick right now\nThat I might have made a mistake on personally because I just got some good information on a football game\nTo Sunday Morning there is going to be a game at six thirty in the morning and it's a game in London it happens to be the Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl champs overnight and cold very hot and cold this year they're checking out in Jacksonville I initially thought Philadelphia minus three be the way to go with the chip that I just got dark\nAnd any gamblers out there is Jacksonville has actually played\nIn London three times not finish your mind you but three times so their organization is used to this other players are used to this which is big when it comes to London we've seen it with the cargo that go over there and you know maybe make a mistake or they're not acting minute or they come too late so whatever the case may be\nJacksonville it's got this figure it out filled out is never played there and the number that I was tossed was any team that are showing up in London for the first time\nAnd played a team that has been there before it was always last\nSo you might want to for your money on Jacksonville ain't gonna get three points I'm Still rooting for Philadelphia now because I got a couple of bucks on them but uh I kind of like the eagles and Alice I'll think of a bit if I were going to bed to launch I'd take Philadelphian lists are\nSomehow it Jacksonville can find a quarterback for the walking around London\nThat's uh that's true so maybe where we'll from London but I Will say a bad that plays out and we'll try to get to some of our picks for the meantime the biggest pick the biggest game for local fan still you're rooting for draft pick or he ruined for cargo victory and like I said before the break\nThrough the next three weeks or only chance really to maybe get a victory against San Francisco or three weeks from now when you play Oakland but not Kansas City but in the meantime Sunday one twenty five\nRight here on Kate you in a you can tune in and get new and they play the games are all that kind of fun stuff but one twenty five will be the kickoff San Francisco forty niners committed town\nDoc not only do we have a newer friends a quarter of that we wanted a we have a mixture Patrick Peterson wind we traded than back in office trades\nWe've got the forty niners were playing pretty good we are a lot of things going on and what do you think of the drama and the debacle happy in Arizona cargo land and who do you think's gonna win there's basically pick 'em game\nOver under is about forty two I'm like in the under I'm like in San Francisco and the game even though it's adult coin toss\nBut your thoughts about Sunday's big big toilet bowl game between one in six forty niners no one in six car\nWell it's more a interesting when we argue about the picture on I'm going to San Francisco\nRusty and when we argue about the picks I'm going to San Francisco too because I just look at that first game and granted that was a win but\nThe cardinals got five turnovers and some of them were kind of freaky turtle over the ball just bounce right above Lyman or a linebacker pick it up and lumber into the end zone for the touchdown so with all this transition going on as well with the cardinals\nI just have to think that San Francisco's the more logical pick now\nAs far as Patrick Peterson goes I remember last year deion Sanders was saying the cardinals even something on TV you know\nGo in trade Patrick it to the team where he can has a chance to win a Super Bowl or a nothing was set of it and then I think with the one in six start\nIn a whole new coaching staff or Patrick Peterson probably do get a little frustrated at ah I Wish I can remember that he has a cousin who played in the NFL and now he's a commentator I think\nFor CBS of on the games or what have you\nAnd I heard him he interviewed and he was like for sure you on any Patrick wants to he he had no doubt about it and one of the points he may which is true is that a lot of these number one draft picks that they were going to try to rebuild the cardinals team with having panned out like\nThe car Assad Reddick for instance and I'm like ... from old miss and in this new system that Steve Wilkes the new head coach is supposed to be a defensive coach\nPut in his day on the candidate was one of our best players he can't even get into the game so I think Patrick's looking around going I don't like the system either and I don't see in the near future we're going to be able to rebuild but\nHis problem is I think he's under contract for two or three more years\nSo he can wine all he wants it at the cardinals don't want a trade or they don't have to trade 'em so I think it did make a lot of drama but maybe it pointed out some things to the ownership maybe there is a problem with the coach and the coaching staff and Patrick's not getting along with them because he always\nGot along very well with Bruce areas they were uh you know kind of like a father son team\nAnd something is up you know whether it's just the fact that there were wanted six or he just doesn't like this whole scheme and what to do coaches are presenting of course\nThe person they fire might McCoy was an all sense of coordinator not Patrick side of the ball for defense and we'll see how that works out I think he did a terrible job I mean they couldn't score and he points so I'm hoping that by Ron a liquid since\nHe did learn some areas maybe he'll kinda\nOf boiled things down and get a precipitous of easy system instead of making it so complicated for here we got a rookie quarterback and she got twenty different variations of play maybe you're better to cut it to ten and see what can happen and then uh I was also reading\nAnd I think Bruce ... mentioned this Mike the\nFor whatever reason when he had good success with David Johnson and it was run in between the tackles and all of the middle and then Patrick bounce out and what have you and I guess I haven't been doing that as much so maybe we'll even see a David Johnson break out too but I'm with you I'm going forty niners on this one\nWell on a Patrick Peterson lots of things you're correct I think it does signal a lot of problems the coaching staff\nThis was coming from the captain of the team right who's not acting like a cap and also which hasn't been mentioned and I'm done with Patrick Peterson is Larry Fitzgerald you know if you're going to trade Patrick Peterson if you feel sorry for Patrick Peterson\nAnd what's going on and he's twenty nine I think he has either two years left or he's in the middle of two years being less I don't know for two more after this I think there is and I think there is now\nBut Fitzgerald\nYou know you gotta feel sorry for this guy's thirty five they keep for I don't know how many years one more year one more year maybe should go to Minnesota they should go wherever you know and he's been putting up with this stuff hoping at least he played in the super bowl you did", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Talk of the
