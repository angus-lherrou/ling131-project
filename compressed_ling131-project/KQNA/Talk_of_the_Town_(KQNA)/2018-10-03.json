or these faculties is the first object the government\nFrom the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results in from the influence of these on the sentiments in views of their respective proprietors named shore is a division of society into different interests in parties\nNow he goes on you can see how brilliant these men are now what you're getting it he says this is the nature of man\nNeeds factions\nThese passions\nThis is the nature of man the late and causes a faction or that's shown in the nature of man\nAnd we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity according to the different circumstances of civil society\n... for different opinions concerning religion concerning government and many other points as well as of speculation as a practice attachment to different leaders ambitious league contending\nFor preeminence and power what a person's of other descriptions whose fortunes had been interesting to the human passions haven't turn divided mankind into parties like political parties\nInflamed them with mutual animosity and render that much more disposed of facts and it'll press each other than to cooperate for the common good so strong as this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosity that where no substantial occasion presents itself\nThe most frivolous and fans of all distinctions had been sufficient to can do their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts but the most common and durable source of factions has been the various an unequal distribution of property\nThose who hold and those who are without property have ever form distinct interest in society\nThose who are creditors those who are debtors fall under I liked discrimination and landed interest a manufacturing entrance I mercantile interest have money to interest but many lesser interest grow up a necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes\nActually hit by different sentiments in views the regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task modern legislation involves the spirit of party infection the necessary in ordinary operations of the government\nNo man is allowed to be a judge in his own case and it goes on\nNow what is the solution as are now move on from federal is ten what is the solution\nThey say if there is a solution it is Republican is\nThat the cancer is democracy and the pure the worst because that leads to mammography and anarchy and ultimately\nAutocracy\nAnd so you see ladies and gentlemen defending the constitution they explain what they've done\nIn order to present this faction which they viewed as a cancer\nWe've created divided government\nA divided federal government and the federal government would divided powers of the states have federal government with specific to numerous powers and all the other governing powers left to the states why\nWhy because you have a diverse people a diverse geography a diverse pre colonial history and diverse populations and the way you bring them together\nIs to not may I say molest their diversity that is attack their diversity\nHits to celebrate it and you celebrate it by creating this\nThis national entity\nAnd yet by controlling it\nWith checks and balances within ... powers\nBy controlling the factions and how do you control the factions you heard Madison well you don't destroy liberty\nYou create a government\nThat is not a government based on pure democracy you'd see the founders of this country feared little D democracy as much as they feared monarchy because neither respects the individual neither respects on the island of Iraq's\nGovernment as a necessity\nBut it's not the priority\nIndividual liberty is\nSo they created this this brilliant document this constitution\nThis constitution to protect each and every one of\nThese imperfect men as all men are\nAs all human beings created the greatest governing document mankind is every now\nAnd then we have this force it's opposite force that is literally destroying the greatest document mankind is ever know\nThe greatest governing system mankind has ever known a governing system that is set up\nTo control itself\nLet me repeat that a governing system that is set up the control itself with checks and balances specific powers is already left to the states and the people\n\nAnd yet we have this force imported from Germany\nThey call themselves progressive all\nTyrannical movements called themselves something they are not the People's Republic the people's revolution\nThe progressive movement there none of these things\nThey all overlap\nAnd what gets under their way is the limitations that are placed on them through our constitution\n\nAnd our constitution is I hold a lot of barriers\nIf you're of a different mindset\nHagel Marx Engels Russo their modern day progeny\nBernie Sanders in his book the constitution is a problem the constitution needs to be destroyed or you claim to be supporting it it needs to be destroyed\n\nThis is why they talk about precedent and they never talk about the text of the original meaning of the constitution this is why they trashed the authors of the constitution\n\nAnd this is why we have a we have today\n\nThis is a battle that is much bigger than Brett Kavanaugh he is the latest casualty any as a casualty and I feel very bad for him and his family what's taking place here is a national disgrace\nAnd yet and yet\nThis force has revealed itself it's revealed itself in the media it's revealed itself and academia it's revealed itself and Congress\nAnd it's revealed itself and Hollywood these are
