Florida dirt or you know I don't know where all colors you are you near the hurricane Joyce\nI'm here now I'm a I'm OK on it I just have to say that these people are so disgusting and ... how are they teaching their children and they traced back then the president of the United states the cops\nAuthority I don't understand like how do they do that and are they happy about that that they teach their children I have three kids I don't care how well they are even if they were fifty doing that in the streets I Would I Would flip out that joy when I taught them\nI'll tell you I think there's two aspects of this first of all I mean you saw this with the kids in the high school that had the shooting last year down in your state where you know they almost immediately it looked like they were media trained professionals with the anti gun anti Second Amendment narrative\nAnd that didn't happen by accident this is what they learn in school in our public schools they they they learn all of these talking points and tactics they literally do\n'em but secondly ... for those who are not so plugged in and so organized and so uh you know the sad into the ... tactics that we're seeing on the streets Joyce just for your average person who leads to the left\nThey've been told for the last two years that America just elected Adolf Hitler they've been told for the last decades the Republican Party is this close to being the Nazi Party\nIn this country if they truly believe that the Nazis are in charge of it makes sense that they would protest the way they do doesn't it\nThey're dividing the country they are they are yesterday are higher absolutely right through it I think and the stress disrespectful\nAll right so what are you going to do to make sure that Rick Scott comes to the U.S\nI I tell every you know my friends my family because everybody watches CNN and everything else less so against him I Can't even believe that their fellow from Fox\nNews everybody talks about that but you know what they tell the truth they talk bad about him or read about him but they tell the truth most\nMostly joys All right well I Hope you're energized out there I Hope you realize how important this is I Hope you do what you can to make sure the Rick Scott is a plus one for the Republicans down there in your state of Florida now so if you stay dry and safe\nHow about a Peggy also
