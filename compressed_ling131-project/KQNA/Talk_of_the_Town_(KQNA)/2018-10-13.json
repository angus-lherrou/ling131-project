{"month": "10", "state": "AZ", "station": "KQNA", "content": "Kind of always interesting the national you'll already have two games under their belt before technically the American league play the

all that kind of stuff a dock oh we've got it's five o'clock\nI Want to I Want to put one thing in there and maybe this will be the bow on the whole situation talking about Chris sales so up to see how his velocity and he's pitching the first game\nAnd this astounded people our score a named David Price to pitch the second game for the red Sox in ten post season starts this this is crazy\nOr his his record as Olin nine with a six point over three he or re and he actually has some bullpen history in the postseason where he does very well so a lot of people were really really surprised that he named David Price\nTo go against ah the Astros so I found that kind of interesting and that doesn't seem like it bodes well for the Bo Sox\nWell that's another reason why we're taking the Astros in that series the starting pitching nominees Chris Sale question mark new to some fatigue and some injuries that he had late in the year But Dave price like you said it's got a terrible record\nIn the postseason so we'll find out a lot more on that one come Saturday and Sunday of course a lot of action tonight or any minute now will keep you posted on on the Dodgers and the Milwaukee Brewers but

for us to the scores but ah miracles never sees the\nArizona Cardinals picked up a win last week\nAnd they're going to be an actor in this Sunday in Minnesota against the Vikings a team that beat the Philadelphia Eagles last week and eagles actually won last night done nicely thirty for Thirteen over New York in New York but the Vikings are a pretty big favorites between ten and eleven points\nDock your thoughts about the Arizona Cardinals last week beating and I think you and I both had this one called we felt they were gonna do okay again San Francisco San Francisco had a lot of problems but in some ways the colonel's got a little lucky in that game and uh ended up\nA lot of points were scored at the end to make this game look a lot different than it started out to be what your thoughts about the game and the win against San Francisco and then there possible\nPossible could they upset the Vikings this Sunday in Minnesota so your thoughts on the one in four Arizona Cardinals stock\nWell they were pretty fortunate to win that game and San Francisco the very first play the game after San Francisco just\nDominated the ball and Joel was down the field for a score that missed an extra point the very first play the cardinals tried was the Seventy five yard touchdown pass from Josh Rosenthal Christian Kirk the local ... product or\nWho I don't know why I went to Texas saying them off to talk to them about that some time and I was thinking wow this game looks like we're going to be pretty good well I think\nThe rest of the game passing wise\nThe cardinals only gain a hundred and forty are\nWise the cardinals only gain a hundred and forty are sold first place Seventy five yards the rest of the game they only went ahead and in a racked up a hundred and forty some odd yards a disappointing thing was\nIt without the defense causing five turnovers and I don't know how often that's going to happen because they were going up against a rookie quarterback because well for the forty niners that's how they got the points at the end\nA couple of times they knock the bottoms hands admitted formal recovery ran one one back for a touchdown so it wasn't the often it's\nPutting the numbers up it was the defense and they went ahead\nAnd you know it was nice victory and I'm Glad they did it was in the division twenty eight Eighteen looks like wow they really romp them but a game was pretty close and I think some of those turnovers were\nI Will say fortunate in Chandler Jones who actually causes one of the ... are you recovered the fumble Anna sac and whatever I think he was named the NFC defensive player of the week off of that came so that's pretty good but they still are having trouble\nHooking up with a wide receivers for some reason David Johnson just isn't running the ball very effectively um I think\nIt's the colonel's arranged on doing this off the top of my head like numbers thirty and points scored in the last in yards and time of possession now catch this against the forty niners\nThe cardinals had the ball for the whole game Nineteen Minutes and forty nine seconds so let's say twenty minutes out of sixty and San Francisco had the ball for the rest of the game they just couldn't punch it\nIn so it's a it's really the kind of kind of sad that running game oh through five games might they gain three hundred and twenty three yards\nAnd that used to be maybe a couple of games for a David Johnson and pass I'm sure all the people that have him in their fantasy league are are a little disgruntled right now so I I Do know that Minnesota was embarrassed by buffalo and their\nRookie quarterback a few games back and I believe that was that Minnesota they really got worked\nSo I think there are going to be coming out with a vengeance and they're going to want to go out and put it to Arizona so I really don't see the cardinals beating\nYeah it's kind of like our human but no ah San Bradford realistically was the number one overall pick out of Oklahoma in two thousand and ten is was the last like bonus baby 'cause now they've got it more\nLike locked in at a certain price but he got a six year deal for seven eight million dollars that year\nHe also earn thirty six million I'm from the eagles where where he went to the next and then they were trained they train them to the Viking so you got thirty six million from the eagles slash biking Seventy million is a national contracts\nSixteen million so far from the cardinals so\nIt's been estimated that he is earned up to this point a hundred and twenty nine million dollars so\nIt's real easy to play it cool and just can count your money but in the meantime at least the cardinals were saving three hundred and twelve grand because I thought it was interesting to not at least have him dressed and be the backup in case Rosen failed or got hurt but\nYou know they've got to go through that next back up and they figure why not saved three hundred and twelve ... twelve thousand dollars I don't care how rich route NFL you know loaded onto our\nYou know but if you said if Rosen or the backup does get her brand for we'll be dressing and he will be in there but he did not come through as people hope to at least the cardinals hope this year and they've already turn this thing over to the youngster\nWell the thing was is there is nice I mean the guy would have been a fantastic\nNFL quarterback but he's how these surgeries time after time\nOn his knees and you could even see this year when he was in there\nHe was just dumping that ball off for like six yard passes and he was throwing the ball down field because he knows one good hitter and boom he's going to be out for the year with surgery on his knees again so a ... like you said he made so much money with the signing bonuses and then\nYou know things the cardinals gave him Fifteen million which at that time it looked like they had to do because they certainly are no\nA print edition that they were going to get Josh\nFrozen but the number ten pick so that fell into their lap and then they had to deal with the situation but oh it was an investment they had to make that I have somebody in there to play quarterback for them this season so\nIf something happens to Josh and God Forbid that or at least we got somebody we could we could stick in there but\nYou're right I mean I Hope he has a good financial manager I probably his own financial manager because he certainly has a geared as career to to have a boatload of money from a ... teams well\nBy Arizona taking on Minnesota this Sunday ten o'clock Arizona time all the action right here in Cape joining eleven thirty AM or to FM stations whichever one comes on stronger for you and your area of the quad cities\nOr the over under forty three in this game I'm not touching that but I kinda like Arizona actually gone up plus the eleven points to a lot of trouble and do it again it well\nYou've got a plus the eleven points to a lot of unemployed again us well and it's down to ten but it's a lot of points in the NFL and maybe with the players coming back\nAnd Rosen I felt he played a better game two games that go into the statistics to bear because all the five drop pass it and I felt he would do better against San Francisco on a ... so it's a little bit worrisome but I think\nEvery game this guy plays is a huge learning experience that he's only play two or three games in the NFL so he's going to be jumping by leaps and bounds\nAnd let's hope this coaches that figure it out and jumps by leaps and bounds too because at some of the problem so we'll see what happens in Minnesota with the Arizona Cardinals at ten o'clock on Sunday all the action right here a couple of their games of note\nThat the I actually like I like the bears are there they started off I I actually got him as a pick on but now they're favorite by three and a half points are going to Miami to play their bears I Believe in week off\nA very good team they really really performing well so I like the bears pair of Seattle's kind of game in London against the Oakland Raiders which despite their new codes or a hundred million dollar coach a you know open to only got one way in Seattle is that a good scrappy team it just depends on who prepares the best over there you never can tell\nWhen I got Seattle's a pick on but now it's a their favorite bike too in that game against Clinton basically a neutral field so I like them in that game\nOn New England on Sunday night it's up to three and a half I got 'em at three by like New England at home against a really good Kansas City Kansas is going to be a great Sunday night game and then Monday you get Green Bay Packers\nI got 'em at seven and a half of the lines up to nine and a half now they're playing the same crazy San Francisco forty niners team in Green Bay has been\nUp and down and all around this year they still got Aaron Rodgers and Monday Night in Green Bay kind of got to like that so any thoughts on those games are doc you happen to have anything I Know you're more when you talk to you about colleges or anything that you like when it comes to the NFL\nOne one game my life because the rams saw or seven point favorite over Denver and Denver's been evidence struggle so uh unless it's snowing there or what have you I think the rams are\nDefinitely one of the best teams are not the best team right now in the NFL and Kansas City New England game I think that's that's a tough one to pick I probably stay away from that I just enjoy watching it but I heard some crazy stab\nWhere Bill Bill check when he plays of Michael rookie quarterback for the first time he's like twenty five I Know so I think that might say something for what's going to happen to Kansas City but they've been playing really really well\nSo that's a game I'm just going to uh pull up and just to observe but I I Do like the Olympics I think\nSo I'm very reasonable that seems to me the rams over Denver\nWould be a pretty good bet if you were going to be betting games\nThe scares the only thing that scares me about that one is I actually took the rams and against last week over Seattle\nSeattle's a little better team in Seattle and the rams I Believe arrested and they were minus seven also and they luckily scraped out a victory for rams fans they were almost going to lose that game they won but they didn't cover\nSo that's why I think it scared me what you're probably right or go with the ... rams have got some great numbers in great players and they look at this point you have like a great coach to let me tell yeah you've got to say if you're if you're going to pick anybody to go to the Superbowl this year on either side you enter the idiocy I think the rams would be you\nKnow barring injuries of course would be your pick of your life depended on it rams are in the super bowl so at this point in the season and you know they were looking looking real strong and beating people generally by more than two points are usually beating them bad except for the game and see but that's a tough place you know Seattle except for the Arizona Cardinals it seems like\nYou know Arizona Seattle whoever's on the road has been winning the last five or six games between those two teams with the wind in Seattle is topping the rams did they just didn't cover last week so you know some good games going on in the NFL let me ask you real quick about the game but tonight\nThere is a there's three college games or one that kicked off with for South Florida in Tulsa there's a six o'clock game air force at San Diego but probably the biggest one for local people will be the seven o'clock ESPN game which is all packed\nTwelve and this is the Arizona Wildcats too I think you called that they did pick up a win in Tucson but now they're traveling to Utah and I remember you always telling me that is a really hard place to be a deal they shouldn't be getting their the fans\nIt's really hard to win in Utah even when you tell it's not very good I think they're pretty good this year so\nYour thoughts on that game the line I got to tell you the line was it's been jumping around you opened up as Utah favorite by Fifteen and I went to Thirteen and a half now it's back up to Fifteen actually took you a ... minus ... I took what you've told me in the past I took Utah\nMine is Thirteen and a half this is where fourteen fourteen and a half mix kind of a difference I liked the minus a Thirteen and a half\nBut to your thoughts on the game regards to the point spread Arizona and Utah tonight it's seven on ESPN your thoughts about that pack\nMatch up that is a tough place to play I I'm Still waiting for the new way to unleash a quarterback who will take but he must he must legitimately be injured a horror else a Kevin some on the new coach just doesn't want to play that style of football worries he turns it over to\nA tape and let someone with a ball because like the last week\nHe was a high school in Canada last year so a tough place to play Utah's got a pretty good defense so and what have you but what what did you see the point spread was on that well it's about fourteen give or take but it is I think it's back up to Fifteen ...\nType of deal and again Arizona did win last week twenty four seven scene over cow as you kind of predicted that was down to San Utah one last week against Stanford forty to Twenty one pie which all shocked shocked by that\nWell that's a big one Utah's wanting to in conference three in the overall Arizona's actually tooling won believer not in the conference ... in Oregon State and cows so they haven't\nPlayed anybody but they've got a better record than a few of the conference so give them credit but uh I think ah how I Would take you in the Fifteen points where I think Utah when the game\nAll right well I'm but I'm I always feel that it's Thirteen and a half so I've got a shock so there you go well they do play very very good defense and there's a lot of teams are\nThey going to Utah and because of the altitude and they've got some pretty good fans they'll that place will be packed in in Iraq on but uh it will take if he's finally turned loose that can be the difference maker and the game so we'll see how that went pans out\nAnd that's the way a lot of time here till the end of the break but the the ... one thing I Want to do and will do this you know maybe five minutes left or something but\nI did go to ... to a wasn't a media day but you can go to a practice of the basketball team with Bobby early and I got to see some of these hotshot freshmen and there's this one kid coming in lieu door\nAll the action right here on cake to an a\nAnd a guy who's coming off of a win against the Anaheim mighty ducks a good team of mine Dr three oh and one in first place in the Pacific division or the coyotes could have beaten and the other night I was at that game document that game show they were the coyotes out shot the ... like forty one now Fifteen or something but they ran into a high goalie\nAnd which has been par for the course of\nThe Arizona ... shot their opposition all three games but I've only gotten one victory and that would be a Wednesday night against the Anaheim a three to two in a shootout so up there on the board there one went to losses and playing pretty well\nAre there are some of their youngsters are are trying to come through Dylan strong got a got a goal in fact I think you've got the first Gulf War the charities are for the whole season little on Wednesday night but what's that about that as one of the many players at the cat is of missed out on the by\nLuck of the draw via by birthdays but this Boston mass use I don't know if you saw this the maple leaves\nAre one of the best teams in hockey early on foreign warranted got nine points\nAre eight points I'm Sorry they're on the top of the Atlantic division\nIn Austin Matthews he scored two more times\nAway just will be last night he has a lead leading nine goals are reading nine goals the counties have three to their old team awesome Matthews has nine and this is ties in nature record after five games for anybody Bobby all Gordy how all that kind of stuff Austin Matthews local kid\nHow could I got 'em but you do to his birthday being two or three days off he was too young they could have drafted I'm of course they've missed out on some other guys one coming in Mr I Will be coming in tomorrow night are awesome math these nine goals dock\nAnd that's already in just five games this year by comedies and action tomorrow night and that'll be against the buffalo Sabres and we'll see if they can or I'll shoot another opponent and maybe I'll score the our favorite I checked the early line there actually favored by a little bit to win that game\nSo fingers crossed for the coyotes and we need somebody here in Arizona to have a good season\nBecause uh you know we can kind of let down by everybody else including the sons that you're going to talk about one last night on the ... and will maybe get you a little feedback that you actually were at the game\nThey did spend some money on a really awesome I don't even get excited about these kind of things but they have a fantastic upgraded\nBig screen in the center rises kind of a scoreboard but it's got it's like a giant HDTV I mean giant like Dallas Cowboys giant HD if you're punting you'll be hitting this thing but it's um four sided\nAnd it's got fantastic color and it does help especially if you're in the end\nAnd the action is on the other end you can watch this big screen from the end of the four sided but that was really a cool edition and I'm surprised we had heard more about it probably costs a couple of million dollars but before we get to the sons and\nAn issue and a few other things dot what did you think of the hockey game it and I do want a nice thing I think it was kind of a joke we were there there was a pretty good attendance maybe ten twelve Thirteen thousand people\nBut if you look in the paper they claimed over Seventeen thousand people and that ... that allow it so that kind of shocked me also but your thoughts about the hockey game the other night that we attended against the Anaheim mighty ducks\nWell lose interest I Can't say the ... like crazy and then they blew it out the end they actually ended up with a six three advantage and I don't even know if they got a shot off during that time so you know it was disappointing loss and I actually went down into the locker room and there\nWas a not a lot of cherry faces eggman Larson tried to put a little bit of lipstick on it and what have you because they chop them but a lot of anti Iran to he was not a not a happy\nCamper so ... it was too but they they lost that game but then came the other night which I think was Wednesday we send a two for one player who stood out and we've been waiting and waiting and waiting it was doing strong\nAnd he actually played well and he scored the very first goal for the ... season and then of talk it put them in a I think a power play and he he did very very well fending off for a couple of uh players for the ducks and what have you so if he could start playing well\nUm he's been he's only Twenty one years old or something like that right now so he's a kid that could end up helping them maybe like a late bloomer so that's kind of what I took out a lot of that and uh I'm with you the the highlight of the evening was the big video bored\n[laughter] exactly [laughter] well the quick notes on the NHL early on Carolina\nIs in first place in the metropolitan division three oh and one uh over in the central division which we know well that's where the Blackhawks side they started off pretty good they drop a little bit but basically tied for first over there as Colorado Nashville in Chicago\nWas kind of a surprise and the Pacific divisions not just the Anaheim mighty ducks in first place\nWith the Las Vegas nights\nOne who is in the Stanley Cup last year after five games there only one in four they've been out scored Nineteen to ten if you remember they got off of that great start last year one the division one to the Stanley Cup but they are they're obligate one and for the last last night the Pittsburgh on the road the last four to two\nSo uh they're actually\nWorse off than the Arizona coyote so you couldn't say that at all last year counties are one and two and three games Vegas was one in four and five games and being scored badly so that's kinda the updates the NHL you're right Dillon strong Twenty one years old let's hope he does something because\nWe had to take him third behind I call him ... David Tune into place\nTake him third behind I call and make David students who players\nThat have really done well and I should be an action Saturday Night barring any kind of injury with the buffalo Sabres now moving over to uh some basketball we wanted to get your insight you had something you want to tell us about the Phoenix Suns but I think we're still pre she's an action here sons are playing a Dallas on Wednesday\nOr they're at Denver on the twentieth and gold and the twenty second not sure if that's the regular season starting out maybe\nYou need to Dallas games that first came to the regular season if I'm not mistaken but I you know really pay that much attention to pre season and what have you what I was paying attention to was the strange timing of firing general manager of Ryan McDonough and a\nDevil made the playoffs in eight years and he's been around here for a while oh I think he ... them one grade year and then they went really really bad uh and he's had some misses\nHe he was responsible for the flare up scoring Roderick\nAnd one of the nicest people I've ever met in sports and he threw him under the bus and so it was a problem and that's why he got rid of them and there are ... that was so far from the truth that it was crazy then he also got rid of Isaiah Thomas\nWho then went on to the Boston Celtics and wasn't MVP Canada and did really well for him and the situation now is which I think is not good as those sons don't even have a point guard even though it may be Devin Booker when he gets back from the reason I have to play the point and that truly not\nYou know terrific situation\nHe had some Mrs ... Alex Lanny drafted him and we can go through the list of his failures but in the middle of all this\nRobert Sarver the owner gave him a three year extension first of me Pam this guy sort of like twenty twenty but they let them go nine games left in the season oh James Jones who is kind of like his assistant and ex player very well respected in the NBA looks like the hair apparent I don't know that he's been\nNamed to that position yet but uh things that that we're going well for the sun's he hired the new coach so they want to go ahead and hire new coach he he did a trade war he picked up a oh\nWhat three guys from Houston we we traded over I'm\nBrandon Knight who then tore his knee up so we got Trevor ... a and a\nCouple of other guys Ryan Anderson who's a good three point shooters so they let them do that then he handled the draft\nAnd they took the number one overall pick which I think it was a no brainer anybody would have taken on D Andrea eight and any range of trade and got this kid mckell bridges who I think is really going to be a a great player and then he took a bunch a rookie\nFarther down in the draft up point guards so it wasn't that he did terrible and then they let them kind of spearhead given Devon book or a hundred and fifty eight million dollar maximum signing a four or five year contract would ever turned out to be so don't let him have all this responsibility and big time decisions\nAnd then they fire and with nine days left and you know the series going around all you didn't get a point guard\nSo that's why they fired him I'm even wandered up maybe something else happened and they just don't want to announce it Neal behind the scenes maybe some of the things happened and I don't really want to cast that out because I've met Ryan I think he's a really nice person and a seemed like a good guy and what have you but I just felt\nIt was very strange the way the firing was handled when the firing came about and within why they let him make all these fantastic ... big money decisions hundred and fifty million dollars is a lot and then why you would give him a three year extension and turn around and fire him so go figure\nWell start or the owner of the sons might be one of the craziest owners in Arizona history", "show_name": "Talk of the Town (KQNA)", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "13"}
