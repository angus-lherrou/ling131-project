I think it's important for your authorities to see what they can do to prevent the next attack\nAnd you and says armed guards at many of your ...\nYeah that's that's a reality that unfortunately Jews face around the world if you go to London and the kind of God you are more likely than not to see actually a policeman\nOr a police car outside same thing in Paris same thing in Brussels and other places around the world that you don't want to see that happen in America I Do think that on high holidays will Sean and you'll keep poured many synagogues you do have a local law enforcement authorities at least since nine eleven\nBut this is just choose going about their business praying\nAnd in a synagogue on a on a Saturday morning and to think that every single synagogue in America needs that type of protection protection is\nIs sad but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population are but to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak up for very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear\nFrom President Trump I thought he had\nYou know what the strongest combinations frankly I've ever heard I've never heard of non Israeli non Jewish leader say those who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that mark from any leader\nAnd not only was it did I did uh did was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the calls he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he said that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them that David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the train as like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there is no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nWell you know mainstream conservatives have never consider themselves for writer embrace David do we ... people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing or college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which is\nIn mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and and political organizations in Europe and even somewhat in the United states this again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic Jew anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero Francis Semitism and holding Israel up to standard holds and all of the nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the ... general assembly U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined\nUm that's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past if not a it's a very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with accused we have always been seen as the canary of the ... in the coal mine\nOf ... of civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the Jews um it's not going to end there\nIt's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put all the politics aside\nAnd stand together whether you're on the right a conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat and and say no to this kind of hate and and the lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sank in the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely putting politics inside but I've been watching as I'm sure you have in the United states and our media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this is Trump this Trump this is Trump the\nAnd the killer this mass murder this this Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump beside you too many Jews around them now you have in President Donald Trump in my view the the greatest supporter of Israel but any American president\nHe's the knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital no president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before\nHe took the Iran deal which was passed by Congress and the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to the terrorists regime which has the United states in Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American is a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\n[noise] yeah I mean I I've said this before or we've never had a strong supporter of Israel with President Trump\nA and frankly it it hasn't even been close in terms of what he's done I mean you believe that some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the decision to do some [noise]\nAnd the case to be looking round the most anti Semitic regime and the planet they call for the annihilation of the one and only two state and you have Hezbollah uh care proxy of Iran did actually one of his ball as leaders said a few years ago that he hoped all the Jews will come to Israel so we can wipe them out there so this president\nDo you hope all the whole company Israel so we can wipe them out there\nThe president of the United states put up to the entire world it was from the nuclear deal with Iran has storage tank tense and against Iran and in doing so he is still this anti Semitic terrorist regime of hundreds hundreds of billions of dollars that would be honest to pick\nA Israelis a and adults with the front and all of our Arab neighbors and everything else one good thing that came out of that that nuclear deal with Israel and the Arab world closer together but we we've had very much in a very grateful for that support it like I said I'm very grateful\nOr that the president forcefully\nA condemned or the anti Semitic attack I I think it it is a very very important I think people think it all of these things happened\nUh because of President Trump's election they're just getting themselves they don't understand the history of at the Semitism it's not only the world's longest hatred all these sacred it's the most malleable hatred I mean Jews are are\nHad been attacked and killed for being a capital for being a communist for being the biggest dogs were being the biggest hawk for being called for being called you know ethnic separatists\nHaters can always find a reason to hate that has been going on for a long time and I hope one positive thing that can come out of this horrific act can't stand together against at the cemetery as President Trump is not the reason why you are but Jeremy Corbyn\nIn Europe or the head of the British Labour Party and anti Semite if it's not but when he's in a while you have all these attacks have for many years and Europe against fortunately this thing is\nHas come here to the United states and ... and is now eleven worshipers and hail a Pittsburgh but if anything can come out of it hopefully people can stand together and put the politics aside understand that there are people who were anti Semite thoughts\nAnd people staying together against is an all out the anti somewhat on the side of the political wild that's\nNot just calling it when it's on the other side but calling it on your all said whether it's David Duke was fair con wherever comes without a college campus with people trying to think about Israel and the fame and demonize Israel and make all these charges that Israel's apartheid state races state a perpetrator of Canada\nWhich I think triggers a lot of apple put a level of hatred towards Israel but could not see of any other country is the minute they wherever it is people have to stand up to it I think in protecting because I think they're going to be protecting our\nAlright ...
