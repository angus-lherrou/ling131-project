we'll see how that develops but first of all I'm trying to watch CNN that Clinton news network last several hours and\nI'm suffering from projectile vomiting and then explosive diarrhea then I Believe from eyeballs thinking what the hell am I watching here\nOh I was thinking what the hell am I watching here\nDid Jared Kushner\nAnd the president himself decapitated and kill Jamal ... somehow didn't we didn't the American people have something to do with the apparent murder of a journalist who's in Saudi Arabia and citizen who finds himself in a in Turkey\nAnd they're constantly and somehow I think objective evidence to show that he was brutally murdered and that somehow America is necessarily involve somehow we did it that were responsible how's that possible\nFor my way of thinking it's not going when someone gets killed\nAnd it wasn't good when Kate Steinle he was killed and it's not a good thing when hundreds of Americans are killed every year through the actions of illegal aliens inside of America is not good when six or seven hundred Chicago's Southside residents are murdered every year or six and seven hundred murdered\nAnd maybe four thousand shot you know it's really a bad thing when a half a million Syrians are barrel bombed by a by Assad\nWho is called by Hillary Clinton at one point a patriot none of those things are good and I'm not saying what happened to a show is

to live especially if you're a woman or at this than\nIt is common in Saudi Arabia for a woman who was wearing certain western attire to be beaten half to death on the streets and it's quite common if you a tweet in Saudi Arabia something negative\nAbout the leaders of that great country that you're going to be put in prison for months or years until you're a pen and it's quite common to uh be hanged\nBy the neck until you're dead or going through a firing squad for demanded his behaviors inside Saudi Arabia and that's still one of the best countries in the middle east compared to Iran

Michael Moore during his weekly general audience and the St Patrick's square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers\nMaybe didn't know Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and huddled with the pope as if he was having a meeting with him Michael Moore is a left wing radical extremist he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood that kills about three thousand developing babies every day\nHe's a ah certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country so if the pope knowingly and wittingly met with Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless\nUntil I find out if the pope knew who he was and it's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly big fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin always largely over\nBut I did some statistical work on what was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead\nThe Supreme Court which I've not had the honor of repairing before\nTakes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court two sides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously\nAnd they normally take cases where there's a conflict between the Thirteen circuits that is if the second circuit as a conflict with the sex or the night with the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year they take for oral arguments eighty cases here\nBy contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a ... month period fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the ... district courts\nYou're talking about maybe a million cases below the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court handles eighty cases\nSo whether it's the hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever it might be\nThe the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the ... circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent so to break it down even further there's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals\nOf the Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges\nOnly four by Republican in one district is split\nAnd so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which is the one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees they're seven at three majority\nSeven three one vacancies now available but that can be one of the three so it's going to say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases are resolved before the Supreme Court level and all of those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges\nSo before you get to fired up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to hold those figures in your mind Supreme Court take the eighty cases\nU.S Circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict courts about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're\nThe only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans as for Trump to be in office another six years and if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent\nOf those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court and those that do generally deal with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are there or not it's certainly a great thing encourage more of it\nBut it would take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent and the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats\nAnd only about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely and should two weeks from Tuesday\nThe Democrat to win the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen he's going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term\nFun becomes available we have two lines open to recall now have seven seven\nThree one two three one one\nPay seven seven three one two three eight one one bill Cunningham the great American in for the great ones are Columbian\nListen to what David aspirin Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk and how much time and\nI have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done David ... absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me why don't you feel how much support the ex chair provides\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ex chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ex chairs on sale now for a one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's ...

there you don't have the factual information record the factual information when both thought a cloud though I don't know how it's going to get them because they're that when the member grow\nThat when the member you cannot deny what you're saying about your own eyes and a lot of going\nTo hold on Cape assuming those things happen and and I certainly except they're true or not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by illegal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and all it's happening inside of our own country\nBecause we don't want I Want to fall on it because President Trump which I voted for planet down he's trying to change the narrative the course\nOf course I asked that when I'm buying jets lab that part's Jeff came out that the Saudis filing the pot heartland dollars worth of weapons that they order something\nGreat to put a lot of work to\nKate Kate there's ten thousand Americans killed every year inside of America do care about any of them let's investigate cage dialing let's investigate about seven hundred murders in the south side of Chicago not solve how about investigating those murders but they don't fit the political diatribe against Trump right\nNow I'm told that the corruption out of many Americans were investigated somewhat not just like so I just got killed by the hour ago and Kurdish hiking on ice if we're not like that and you asked me if I'm Talking about one hundred percent on your side we just need to get\nLet's say how come the murder of Assad citizen in Turkey it's such a big deal here why\nBecause way complicit with\nThem or not to say we're not complicit were crap we're not complicit with anything come on man come on we're not in the ... are you one of those\nCharacters whatever bad happens in the world America is complex and what does that mean complaints it what does that mean while still but was it for the sides to kill them in that fashion almost on videotape that was stupid that was real stupid and I hope we're not stupid but even if it happened the way we think it happened\nFrankly my dear I don't give a damn\nCompared to what's happening in this country every year\nHow many cops are killed two hundred cubs are murdered every year in this country the CNN go into the murder of police officers and one that's a horrible thing how come CNN will not cover the murder cops but they're covering some such citizen in Turkey why\nI totally agree with you just like we have three hundred and Seventy five thousand and watch it every year I don't you talk about you\nKnow big doing what they're just using this as a country will there be trumping the head with as if we care and I don't care compared to the murder of cops\nThe murder of the innocence ten thousand murders cage timely hundreds of Americans killed by legal aliens rapes in robberies how about investigating and those things that make sense\nIt makes perfect sense that we want to investigate the friday to bone up innocent children in this way for us made weapons saying we're not going to investigate that so that\nYou you mean in Yemen and I just got killed their life and you know as weapons with Saudi Arabia so\nWait a minute these are you saying we're complicit in that too because we sold a weapon as somebody Smith Wesson complicit in one of their weapons killed somebody\nBombing you know they're not coming under fire bombing them corners country in the middle east with weapons\nComplex than in any of that is correct complicit of one of their weapons is used the wrongfully killed somebody is Beretta complicit\n[noise] but a lot of money is the root of all evil\nYou know the the air out of here thanks for your call hope the Dodgers lose this afternoon but let's continue is more aware of let's go to Chris in Atlanta Georgia Chris in Atlanta Welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead Chris how are you\nI'm doing well are you a\nGreat day to be an American please go ahead\nAmen to that so just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um [noise] I don't I Can't paraphrase what you're saying about the specifically about him being at a price or what have you on that you have a problem with a meeting with Michael Moore hell yeah\nOkay well I mean just just out of curiosity I mean I'm just some sort of playing devil's advocate with is so because I have an issue with it too but um if if we believe I'm Catholic so I Believe him being the vicar of Christ justice Christ man went with centers um [noise] what what is your what is your what's your\nI I agree with that to criticize the difficulty I don't think Michael Moore went there to get the pope on video\nTalking to him as if he was a center wanting to be confessing to Henry saving grace from the pope\nI think Michael Moore went there as a student to capture the pope in a moment that he could use for his own political purposes against Trump and it Michael Moore has had some ... sources like Paul and the road to Damascus\nAnd said okay I've seen error my waves I've seen the damage that cause the police officers in American Soldiers\nI see the damages caused by three thousand innocent babies killed every day in this country and I'm going to the pope for forgiveness for what I've done I'm with you but I think Michael Moore probably went there with the pope today in order to get a photo opt to use politically against them that's what I think\nGet a photo opt to use politically against them that's what I think\nI agree with that just shows you my personal background\nWell you know Chris suppose give an interview to what you said as soon as I read newspapers and it's not watch television\nAnd it came from Argentina now in Rome and we'd like to think in America we're the only country that matters but I guess if you spend your life in Argentina Brazil and Central America South America and now you live in Rome\nYou probably don't read newspapers or watch TV how would you know Michael Morris and do a you know I guess I could work my way to the front of the line and get a picture with the pope but I Would like to think that Michael Moore is not one of those characters the pope would be familiar with\nAnd if he was I Would hope Michael Moore was able to convince the confessed as many since\nSure no I I think about people and maybe I'm just a little bit about him that strikes me is\nUm you know I like to be there are there are a lot of things that really strikes me is not it's not surprising when\nThere's\nNo question he is not the last pope now he's not Benedict he's France's and he's a socialist he's left wing er and er\nAnd this whole uh precisely scandal or something that I Hope it's not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but what he did with Medicare and what he did with the world didn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I I just hope there is no there there are what Chris we gotta go thanks for your call let's continue no calls from Texas Virginia New York coming up in about forty five minutes I spent some time with the president when he was in Cincinnati, Ohio I broadcasts from\nA couple of days ago and I'm a share
