with all his books\nHe asked me to write a little\n... to them [noise] and um [noise] here's what it says\nGrowing up as a young child and then teenager in the streets of Philadelphia in the twenties and thirties\nMy father Jack into found appreciation for the role of the police my parents taught us from a young age to respect the police and they're difficult job in fact two of my uncles served in the Philadelphia police department uncle willy was a motorcycle officer an uncle Jack was a traffic officer\nMy father is a deeply patriotic man with a great deal of common sense you understand set in all walks of life and in every profession\nMan's imperfections present themselves but having witnessed recent events in related news reports painting police officers and police departments and extremely negative light he felt a book especially geared to our young people was a central so that they learn to respect law and order\nIf you could imagine that America without law and order there'll be a place where people will be free to create all kinds of trouble endangering our lives families businesses in lifestyle\nIn other words America which seats being the America we know and love a civil society with a life liberty and happiness of the individual arch average to protect them and I might add right now\nBut it's all keep in mind those brave police officers who rushed into the synagogue while at mass murdering subhuman cockroach was slurring parishioners\nTo walk into the United states senator Lyman Trumbull chairman of the Judiciary Committee any powerful supporter of

come completely within our jurisdiction or subject to our laws that we think of making citizens and they're going to be no objection that proposition that such person should be citizens\nOf this was familiar language the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six\nDefined citizens the United states has quote all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power excluding Indians not taxed unquote\nNot subject to any foreign power it is universally agreed that the immediate impulse for the passage of the fourteenth amendment was the constitutional lives constitutional eyes the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six\nIt was an attempt to put the question of citizenship and matters of federal civil rights beyond the reach of simple congressional majorities that's it is clear the idea of allegiance not subject to any foreign power quote unquote was central to understanding the jurisdiction clause of the fourteenth the\nBacklog what is the bottom line here what's number number this they wanted to make certain\nThat former slaves\nWill be treated\nAs citizens of the United states\nBecause certain states we're still resistant\nThey wanted to make sure\nThat former

Seventy\nBegins extending a offers a citizenship to Indian tribes or most of what you agree so you're a citizen of a tribe and the citizen of the United states\n[noise] there's a Supreme Court opinion and Eighteen Ninety eight United States versus one Kim arc we've talked about this I've written about it\nAnd that declared the fourteenth amendment adopted the common law definition of birthright citizenship [noise] um but the decision conferred birthright citizenship on a child of legal residents of the United states\nNow the majority is broad enough to include children born illegally in the United states as well as legal immigrants but that's not what the court decided\nIt wasn't even presented to the court and so of course you have individuals who are trying to read it in to it\nThe court has never decide\nThat is the children of illegal aliens for automatically\nCitizens of the United states think of the absurdity of\nThose who passed the amendment specifically rejected the idea\nWe know who would apply to\nThe freed slaves\nAnd we know that in the Nineteen sixties at some point the interpretation change for the executive branch\nIf you or someone you know he's

hundred three nine o nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight [noise]\nExactly it's like saying prove to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that\nFor most of our history we didn't have too many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow and there was never an active decision what happened was because most people are born here who who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens\nAnd we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants hospitals never asked any questions and H H death on the Social Security administration never clamp down on it on the back end how do I know this is true because everyone agrees that children of diplomats are excluded\nRight I mean that's the whole point that they are not subject to American law they had read about angry\nChildren a diplomat tourists\nWho just come to the United states I mean real tourists not not the the shame that we see taking place in some of these places but just because you're a tourist in the United states you have to give birth doesn't mean that you then a seed a birth birthright citizenship to the United states if you say from Canada\nExactly exactly I mean that's that's the point so you know there is evidence that there are plenty of children of diplomats that are also being handed a citizenship papers and the path administer agents had been extremely lax\nAnd in that case everyone agrees they're not entitled to it so again this is a passive act\nTrump is actually restoring\nThe real law on this dates back to the use this as grants attorney general\nOr just a couple of years after the fourteenth amendment half he said very clearly\nThat this means people subject to complete jurisdiction not aliens with parents born abroad um there were two other cases before then it said the same thing this justice pray overturned that inexplicably and this is just the stuff that nobody is willing to talk about\nMm now let's make something very very clear about this they say it's a dubious legality for the president had to do this with an executive order let's walk through this together\nSo in the Nineteen sixties and seventies the bureaucracy starts concerning citizenship when the children of illegal aliens not based on the statute not based on the constitution it takes hold throughout the federal bureaucracy who's in charge of the federal bureaucracy Daniel ... it's\nThe further than\nThe president you know so it presidents and you know what\nI I I'm going to stop that some of the river then including the leader of the Republicans in the house they say you can't change the constitution by executive order you know that's what Obama was doing we don't do that kind of stuff\nYour point earlier he's not changing the constitution by executive order he's not re interpreting the constitution by executive order he's getting the executive branch under control and saying this is what the fourteenth amendment means\nThis is what I wrote my book stolen sovereignty literally we have stolen sovereignty the executive branch made this decision I imagine if the people would have voted or Congress would have conducted a vote\nWe're going to give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of people every year who break into our country against their consent no one would have ever voted for that that was a bureaucratic creation\nAnd again the let's zoom back to asylum to many other changes Trump is making he's merely merely restoring\nThe constitution and the statutes he's overturning the other administrators\nA lawless acts of previous administrations you know very well marketing and you do this as well as conservative or view we are not in lockstep with everything that any party does we'll call it president if we disagree with something\nBut everything he has done an immigration is actually the base statute its past administrations have done this a verdict that he's changing\nSo I mean is the head of the executive branch she doesn't need a statute\nOr to reverse what the executive branch did without a statute does he\nKnow know unless Congress the only thing that could happen if Congress with their naturalization power could explicitly say thou shall give a citizenship to all legal they they could do that but until they were at ...\nIsn't the problem though that the courts might aren't the courts out of control even these so called constitutional is on the court\nUm you know to stay my on popular opinion here I mean this was my concern about Gorsuch and I think we've seen that in a very similar sovereignty case into my of these sessions um I I don't know if we have five votes I I doubt Roberts will be with us but\nI don't I I don't I don't think a cabinet would be with us\nI I think yeah I mean I I Know Tom it would be based on his past writings and his understanding of sovereignty but but here's the broader question issuing citizenship birth certificates that is an executive power\nWho's to say that the judiciary has the final say this is not something you know IBM versus Microsoft case or controversy this is the most foundational national question\nAnd the notion that we're going to see that to the courts\nBut the problem is the courts sees it for themselves look what look what they did to the president when he was simply trying to have a six month respite so we could vet people coming here from six\nMajority Muslim countries that are spreading terrorism in those countries where there's civil war in those countries it didn't even included majority Muslim countries with the vast majority of Muslim population and look what happened in these federal district court in circuit court you you have to hold your breath\nOwned by the way since Trump won in Trump V. ally and the Supreme Court\nEither way since Trump warning Trump veal I and the Supreme Court subsequent lower courts have come back and basically we're appeal that Supreme Court decision\nThey're just totally disregarding it and putting injunction on very similar policies visit what happened and I I don't know the answer for this one as a society at the body politic both the executive branch and member of Congress that both parties say let's see what the court say well I mean if the courts are not a concurrent power\nSide by side but standing over them we have North Korea and there's no elections\nSo this is the problem yeah I don't think this will do well in the courts but again they would stay the same thing if Congress or to do it just last week a district judge said that a statute of Congress making it illegal for local communities to thwart federal immigration law is unconstitutional\nNot the president statute so I don't know what you do with that\nMhm [noise]\nWell here we are but one of the things I'm very pleased about is it sounds like the president is taking this on now I hear some of the race ... on cable TV well actually the cable TV filled with race matters and I heard one of them say recently that today the president brought this up\nThe crate division president even bring it up he was asked about by by a reporter who was interviewing him who got word that they are quietly looking at this and the counsel's office or maybe the department of justice even said I don't know how you got that information and they turn it into what race issue\nOf course they're going to write\nMark you know it's tragic about the race issue\nAnd it's really ironic and really said the fourteenth amendment was crafted to ensure that the declaration of independence would actually the vision would actually be actual alive men the bare bones minimum writes life liberty and property would be given to black American citizens that should've been citizens for many years they were here for centuries\nAnd instead that is being bastard dies to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise all American citizens black and white and everything else at the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a ...\nMinute let me just say that I have to go some Len let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans adamant that amendment was for former slaves that's it done and it was to make\nSure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil the post civil war amendments was to protect\nFormer slaves had nothing to do with illegal aliens same sex marriage this one not one of the nothing whatsoever so the left pours the agenda end of the fourteenth amendment which wants to do Daniel Horwitz keep up the good work we much appreciate it\nMy friend and ... and God Bless you to listen to this\nThe iris hired a small army of private
