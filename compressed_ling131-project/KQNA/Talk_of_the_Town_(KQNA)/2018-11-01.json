to you know I Want to swing back into Florida\nThis Florida race is particularly important as far as I'm concerned because it's a lost her to the what the Democrat Party is up to\nAndrew Gillum is repulsive to me\nAs he has dipped his toe repeatedly and the anti Semitism and anti Semitic actions and yet\nHe's tried to turn this campaign into a campaign of race\nTo try and turn out the minority base in Florida and it may well be work\nHe's a radical left us he wants to destroy Medicare he wants to destroy all your private health care systems\nUnions out there who've negotiator for your health care all this stuff goes away if you have quote unquote Medicare for all they use the word Medicare because they know many of your love Medicare so they're using the word Medicare to destroy Medicare Medicare for all\nMeans a iron fist that top down health care program that's what they're talking about government run\nGovernment ... we don't need a government run health care program now this guy Gillum\nIs making\nAgainst his opponent run to scientists\nWho served in combat\nHe's now saying that the sentence wrote a book that support slavery\n\nSo I I went back and I read what this guy Gillum is talking about\nAnd it's also up at hot air if you want to check it but I I'll upon them not supporting slavery and the least\nHe's explaining one happened here's what he wrote here's what he wrote\nHe wrote and I'm paraphrasing that what happened\nAt the constitutional convention\n[noise] was that they couldn't push the issue of slavery as far as someone or to push it although some wanted to push it all the way\nThat is the abolition of it because you wouldn't have the United states under those circumstances you wouldn't have brought in South Carolina Georgia and some of these other states in this there's no question that's the history\nThat's the history of what took place\nBenjamin Franklin was an abolitionist\nAlexander Hamilton was an abolitionist several of them were abolitionist but they voted the way they voted because they felt they needed to have a union and then from there they could address the rest that's exactly what took place you know who else took that position sixty years later\nSeventy some years later Abraham Lincoln he explained it exactly the same way that they had to leave it to their progeny their children and grandchildren to fix the citrus slavery\nBut if there hadn't been a union that wouldn't have been a civil war to eliminate\nThat's what the census rights for all intents and purposes taking up the position that Lincoln took up taking up the position of Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton took up so this guy Andrew Gillum\nSays that demonstrates that the fed this wrote a book defending slavery\nNo\nThis man is repulsive\nAny that demagogue\nHe's alive is way through this election about the undercover FBI investigation not only the city but him\nHim it was just shut up when they gave him that chicken to Hamilton oh what's that set up when they gave him a a a hotel room I been set up when he got a trip that Costa Rica any pretense\nThat he was an honor is not under investigation and if you get a raise it you're attacking all African Americans that's highly stretch it out\nThat's totally shut you down but I Want to tell you a little bit more about this man who the Democrats are hanging their hopes on rock Obama's in Florida campaigning for Joe Biden's in Florida Hillary Clinton how can they back a man like this\nI Would ask I meant NBC and CNN how can I buy a man like this who has a history like this\nAaron Klein over at Breitbart the good man\nAaron Klein over Breitbart the good men\nThat ties between the Israel boycott\nPromoting an anti police dream defenders group\nAnd the Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum run deeper than previously reported\nGillum work at the George Soros finance people for the American way you remember that Norman Lear group\nWhere he served as director of youth leadership programs from two thousand five until twenty Seventeen and over it that's a long time and oversaw a radical training out for calling itself young people for or why pie for\nPhilip Agnew the cofounder of dream defenders remember that name dreamed offenders is it two thousand five graduate of Gillum former why pie for group\n\nNo guilt it's why before he gave Agnew than Norman Lear award named after the producer and activists who founded people for the American way you know that group hardcore left wing trashes constitutional is nominees to the court\nDeal on his face controversy over his refusal to disavow dream defenders which is engaged in activism to promote the boycott of Israel\nAs spouses anti patriotic anti capitalism airtime military anti police ideology with which Gillum has already been associated\nThe dream defenders website refers to the Empire State of Israel as quote the site of a continued shetler colonial project on ... said this is\nAll about anti Semitism\nAnd laments US military aid to the Jewish state they large section of the site promotes the group's anti Israel activists now why isn't this being reported on CNN\nAnd MSNBC\nInstead they're promoting him\nGillum his dream defenders allies compiled an education tool for us teachers about quote liberation movements and that glorifies the popular front for the liberation of Palestine PF helped me a deadly terrorist organization well I guess he has a lot in common with Obama\n\nRepublican challenger Rhonda sent us has repeatedly called for them to distance himself from the dream defenders\nAnd during a debate nine days ago going claim that he had no idea what to say it's a source of referring to when he brought up my dream defenders pledge Gillum reportedly signed that supports a radical manifesto the fact\nIs Andrew signed a pledge with a dream defenders pledging his support this radical manifesto decided just said during the debate I have no idea what pledge he's talking about Gillum reply so he's a liar\nAnd that's a pattern whether it's tickets to Hamilton a hotel room Costa Rica is a pattern a ball\nFace lie because he thinks his supporters and his would be voters are so stupid they're going to buy is race baiting his ... they're going to buy the Hawaiian\nIslands claim of ignorance about the pledge came despite is already known close relationship would dream defenders\nGillum has talked about aiding the group's activism and has written and strong support of dream defenders ... cofounder this fellow Agnew to whom he was a mentor and turn\nAgnew himself recently described a long and close working a personal relationship with him and said he considers going to be part of the movement quote unquote\nGillum was tape that he June debate saying that he is pleased I'm proud to have sneaked food to dream defender activists growing it's thirty they sleep in protest at the Florida State capital and I can go on and on with
