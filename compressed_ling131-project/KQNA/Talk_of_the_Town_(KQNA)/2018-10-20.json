it's a critical of the new staff\nBecause their credibility with zero winning any game was good for us when he can only prove that you're going in the right direction or the also use the quote a firm

from that so he's got skills almost like a forward and he probably could shoot threes I Am sure they don't want 'em to\nIn our new coach the one thing I'll say about him to as he won some European Championship or in fact that Luca ... kid was on his team and he was a star player for them uh over in Europe so ah he's been an assist in the NBA with many many teams but I think I think he was a

coordinator fired and a lot lot more heads to probably rural going to be a long season and hold the one that all at least bring them a high draft pick\nAnd uh but locally we've got some football going on in the quad city areas and a lot of home games and some teams playing very well I won't be Bradshaw amount even though they were upset a week or two ago by Prescott Prescott high it when that big grudge match in Prescott valley but both teams are highly ranked and trying to make the playoffs\nIf you're looking for something to do tonight weather's pretty good seven o'clock kickoff will hobby at Bradshaw mountain Lee Williams replaying at Prescott and seven o'clock makers travels to Flagstaff\nCoconino attacked us these are all teams that are playing in that same conference I'm not I don't have a mayor\nAll teams that are playing in that same conference I'm not I don't have mayor I actually I might have the valleys planet river valley\nAnd I don't see mayor on here so but the two big games going on branch on my own kind of home game Prescott high it's got a home game so hopefully they'll go out there and support those guys are both doing very well Prescott itself for no in conference sixty two overall Bradshaw mountain three into seven into overall\nSo and of course right up there to check post games out and a dog you are going to tell us a little bit about the\nBetter football game last night of course the the Arizona Cardinals was not a good showing on national TV but another game was on national TV ESPN\nStanford Cardinal came in and played in their ranks they played the issue Sunday I've also been playing some pretty good games you of course we're out there and tell the listeners of course we saw the score twenty this Thirteen little boring and the first tap I happened to rush home\nAnd watch the last eight ten minutes thought you're going to may be polite and overtime type game but uh your thoughts on last night's game in Tempe\nYeah what was it was disappointing and this is the fourth came to sun devils have lost by a touchdown and they're almost like you know well that's great we only lost by a touchdown but you know I'm I'm at the point where I Want to start winning some games there are three and four overall one at three in the conference\nWe beat team they beat was Oregon State which is a horrendous team in Stanford this was the game they really should have won\nA they held Bryce Love running back we went for three hundred and seven yards last year against this bill though I think he has a sore ankle but they held them is Twenty one yard so our defense\nReally played well but gosh when you started watching the off chance which I thought it would really be good this year they have a senior quarterback and many Wilkins of probably\nOne of the top two or three wide receivers in the country in the keel Harry they project him going in the first round easy and maybe even at the top ten as far as picks go but many is just having trouble throwing the ball Mike I Can't tell you how many times\nLast night guys would be less wide open and he'll throw the ball six feet over their head I mean there is no way they can catch the ball is just like\nA if you look at the polls there's you know anything can happen it was moving weeks so to speak so a lot of teams going up and down I foresee a lot of the pack schools went down very few in the top twenty five a lot of the SEC ... teams are are up there a Notre Dame a few of the independence are doing OK\nAnd like you mentioned they issue there an action next week\nAgainst us see it's October twenty seven at USC twelve thirty the kick off we don't know about TV who's going to be carrying it\nThen they got home games against Utah UCLA or other games I Want to key on that are on TV and maybe get your predictions on a few of the other pack games including you if they can't leave our wildcat friends and listeners out some decent morning games\nI'd check your listeners again but I'll just throw a few out here on channel ten you've got Michigan at Michigan State and Michigan State to seven points of course there's the was the quarterback he actually had a nice come from behind when last week put them back to the top twenty five is grapple lives up there a little work here the quarterback\nOr you know he's a he's a local kid I went to high school in the Phoenix area and almost came to a U.S who I was to schools he did choose ... Michigan State he's a big kid good quarterback\nYeah and they moved up in the polls and I I actually liking the Michigan ... number seven in the nation I like Michigan State in this game at home getting seven points\nOn the call they're not a couple of the ... games Oklahoma's TCU and it's on channel Fifteen not that there's this huge but Illinois at Wisconsin Wisconsin's a good team that's a nine o'clock kick off on a fast one\nAnd there was another nine o'clock game that I'm a little bit interested but other people that maybe you know 'cause ... a big school opera it's going to Oxford play Ole Miss and the grow I was always a good atmosphere there Auburn minus for actually do love Auburn minus for after their they lost the game\nLast week I think they're going to hell Mississippi's probably going like oh no no they're going to show to come out and you know just waiting but beat somebody like forty points so I'm like an Auburn at Mississippi minus the four points those are all nine o'clock games as a few other one\nLater in the day you've got the Alabama at Tennessee and even though his games in Tennessee you are talking about orange is gonna be a hundred thousand orange Alabama travels well so they'll they'll buy a few tickets but Alabama's favor like twenty nine points\nI'd be tempted to take Tennessee plus the points but hey it's Alabama and they could probably beat the cardinals right now and I'm not just kidding but Alabama at Tennessee twelve thirty kick off if I'd a channel five\nNow here's one of the first pack games I Want to ask you about\nAnd it's also at twelve thirty game on channel ten\nIn Colorado and Washington you know a lot about these schools a she's already played Colorado was disappointing to the issue I think I read one stat all their losses abide by it touched on our last you know what I said the losses by one TV yeah it's a shame but do you ... Colorado like Washington\nTV yeah it's a shame but do you like Colorado and Washington at twelve thirty tomorrow on channel ten Washington is favored by sixteen points a fairly quick any thoughts on that particular game duck\nColorado needs is to stay competitive and they they lost to southern Cal last week so it was a that many points I Want to Colorado or they're playing out Washington tough place to to play but the the huskies last or you're only talking about that last week I was shocked me\nSo what's the Seventeen points Colorado needing to really make a mark if they want to qualify in the pack a twelve south\nI thought that I think what you're saying is Washington is going to win but to Colorado plus the point yeah probably\nBut I uh I Do think that Colorado will give them a game\nOther twelve thirty games uh some are all in college football be Wake Forest at Florida State that's on ESPN to\nNorth Carolina state at Clemson again twelve thirty is on ESP ESPN and then moving up to a one o'clock game this is only on the pack twelve network but it's one I can ask you about real quick cow at Oregon State callous favor by seven and a half points any quick thoughts on that one\n... state is so bad but you think they have to win the game but I I Will go with the cow I haven't seen anything from Oregon State for whoever they play that they've done well\nAnd then three later gangs are they kind of dwindle as he afternoon progress as a few censors of\nCould be a game seven now we're going to let you know about the baseball game six uh starting off here in a little bit they'll be any scores and then there's a game seven if it's six oh nine tomorrow so maybe that's one reason not as many college football games but there's one here in Mississippi State at LSU\nThat's a four o'clock takeoff on ESPN alike LSU minus the seven we saw what they did\nLast week at the tiger down I've been up three or four games there and it's a tough place to play\nAnd a Mississippi states going in a tough environment or here's one that is for Dr ... twelve game is the fourth thirty kick off on channel ten and its Oregon your getting dogs at Washington state Washington state's favorite by appoint any thoughts on that one dog\nWow that's a that's a close spread um\nOregon needs to to keep winning wash it this is the problem is that you're playing at Washington state and you never know what the weather is going to be like ... can be really nasty but uh I've been with Oregon on this one because they're playing for something they beat Washington\nAnd uh they've got kind of the road to the pack a twelve north so it looks like what a Oregon's the real deal this year that are kind of surprising me so go with the ducks\nIn a few other as well as the networks got banned the Kentucky at four thirty which has got to surprise teams you're not even a good this year I was yeah they were five and oh and then he finally last one to ...\nAnd a van de Smet scrappy to Beth on yesterday said uh one of the game was on a pack twelve network that you might know about you know we'll get into the Arizona at UCLA game but the ... network at five got southern Cal\nAnd that's who the issues taken out in a week correct so southern Cal ... Utah and that's the five o'clock game and I don't have a line in front of me I Will try to have only six and a half so what do you think of that so I take it a Utah favorite by six and a half\nYes and now you tell us a tough place to play because of the altitude and uh all that stuff that's going on so I'm going to be a contrarian on this though because\nI watch southern Cal dismantle Colorado which really surprised me they have so much talent and I think they should they vow to start a freshman quarterback so this kid now almost is technically a sophomore in of course he was the five star or maybe the number one quarter back in the country\nWhich they all seem to get so I'd say a take a chance to go with southern Cal in this one\nThe last ... we're going to touch on will be the ESPN two game it's at seven thirty in the Arizona Wildcats and they travel to California play UCLA\nWhich is a team last week it was a surprise I think UCLA was pretty bad and you went the other way but if they had a I was at forty seven or something I I don't have it in front of me will they raise\nA child they finally maybe chip Kelly put it together for the for the mother and\nFavored in this game or in any issue fan I guess we'll be happening without a wild cat fan but UCLA is favored by nine or they looked terrible so last week so I don't know if what what UCLA team's going to show up a dog what do you think's going to happen\nTomorrow night for the Wildcats seven thirty ESPN to UCLA favor by nine\nWill get better diction you may every week because they have\nA little tape of the quarterback the kid that last year was up for the ... and I just keep waiting for him to break out well I guess this ankle injury is a little more significant they let on so they're actually going to be starting their third string quarterback and he's the son of rich Rodriguez the guy that they fired he actually stayed in school\nAnd I think he played high school ball up in Tucson and what have you so I don't know third string quarterback looks like maybe UCLA is finally starting to put it together with ... systems so uh this is the one time and again I'm going against\nWhat I'd been seeing each week and that's because I don't think the ... kids going to play at all I'm going with the with the Bruins UCLA\nRight well I'll be watching baseball hopefully not just all I Do too yeah I just turn a little bit of this first pitch coming up we'll keep you posted but tomorrow night could be a game seven six oh nine\nFor the Dodgers and brewers if the brewers can when they're down three games to two\nSo they've got their game tonight they're trying to even the series against the Dodgers with ... wait Miley on the mound and if they can pull off all winter night than it would be Dodgers and the brewers for the whole enchilada for the national league pennant\nAnd the chance to take on in the world series the Boston Red Sox who have clinched\nTheir ... and uh you know added a little cherry to their a hundred and eight wins or the you know he went through the divisions charities and and now they took out the ... World Series champs in the Houston Astros and Burr lander and all that great pitching that the Houston Astros have\nAnd they ... him and he used to feed him they swept him yeah use it in the regular season my you've probably already know this but\nThey the Astros were terrible at home but on the road just as a flip flop they just had a great record but they did lose a lot of games out they asked to uh I mean that's a minute maid park for whatever reason\nYou know they don't have to look at that could be at the uh you know it's humid or\nWhether or not so much that but the visiting team would hit the Bucky Dent home runs like they did the other night that's clean Houston Astros were hit the caps and get caught so I don't know or their fan gotten away but uh even though we we agree that the famed really didn't that was a bad call and I write the or the first game in Fenway\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] for that's a catchy tune that's all I can say little ribbons accomplish shared getting us ready for the last twenty minutes let's talk sports so\nEverybody a we're really glad that you're listening and hopefully\nYou've been hearing us vent and maybe you could invent a little bit too we certainly have enough enough going on negatively\nIn uh our sports scene with between the cardinals now their troubles they're having a the diamond backs who knows what's gonna happen a complete build down or build up a you know just trading people off left or right or\nMaybe thinking the windows still may be cracked a little bit and going for it um the sons they look like they're on the rebound we talked about that but one thing I Want to tell you now this is something I always wonder about because you have to be very\nTrusting when you go to like a baseball game basketball game or whatever so coal America park which is in Detroit\nThey just fired a food vendor at the tigers home stadium and there's so many videos now you would think people would be really careful but they have a video of this kid bidding on pizzas\nSo here we are you go up to you know I don't know which ... was a little Caesar's or God Knows what I shouldn't throw a name like that you know but uh this kid is putting on pizzas and then I'm pushing them out to the customers I don't know if he had something against one of the customers or if that was a\nInstead of mushrooms his idea of of a like a great way to go about it but it kinda makes you sick you're you're like all those uh trusting\nAnd even when you go to a fast food here who knows what's going on but the the one good thing they did arrest them I don't know what's gonna happen to them or what the punishment will be you probably have to just go through some uh\nA community service or something but they did do tests on him and he didn't have any communicable diseases or what have you but I'm just a little thought the next time you go to a ballpark and get a pizza I Know I ruined it for you but when I got all that I couldn't help\nI betcha if you get a drug test on them with all the legalized marijuana he probably shouldn't go on it and there's just no\nYeah that's true and it looks like a you know like the green that he put on the top of the pizza but I mean that is pretty sick and you know and then just yeah the\nKid would even do that I mean I don't know where their country go to Mike I don't know what we can or what we can do about it that's even worse than ...\nWell maybe maybe it was not smoke to some of the Reagan I thought it was pot or he's on his way to well you know Detroit that's right across the line from Canada and it's all legal there now so yeah I heard that so many which shot or even a becoming very much like the fans of Los Angeles Dodgers dog\nAnd I got a little bit of trouble\nAnd I know he wants to win but I don't know if you're playing against the rules the yogurt doing it as you get the a rod like what's going on with Manny\nWell it's it's worse than a rod and rod was kind of like plan hands easily Bronson are loyal to knock the ball away what he's doing could\nActually injure somebody I don't know if you saw the play I'm sure you did when he was running to first base and got thrown out and like I hate to lose\nLike like a ... I'm not sure how you present you are in fact I got a large garage and they way yeah he smacked into you know deliberately he just like kick them in his ankle as he was going by yeah you know two thirds of the base he could have just stepped on\nAnd that's what I said earlier a Christian yellow which is a pretty laid back guy\nAnd he just said well ask about he said dirty play by a dirty player\nAnd there was a couple of other guys and the the walking clubhouse that have the same opinion then\nI found this interesting um which I could pull it up because I'm not sure where I found this but they interviewed buck Showalter because buckles his manager he was on a charter was an Oreo for many years and finally I got some prospects and I got rid of them and the and what have you\nAnd so I'm a buck really likes him you know\nAnd he was like well you know why did why did he do that he says it's it's hard to defend as your as a manager of ours want her to be supportive but when you look at what he's doing he says I I just can't defend that he thought I thought about it a lot\nA and I'm sure if he could he would not do it again but\nHe also had some slides into second base\nAnd they weren't really trying to break up double plays he was he actually would raise his hand up high and hit the second baseman and one time the kids didn't even throw the ball I don't know that he could have gotten rid of it anyway but ah he's making that I'm\nKind of a couple of times where he was hitting was closed to or were you know you'd be over in pain and then one other time he pushed the guy's leg away when he was trying to do the double play so he's been doing some things in the series or a aren't going over and you can watch tonight as your ah watching the game of walking when he comes up\nThere was going to be a lot a lot of Milwaukee\nHe comes up there was going to be a lot a lot of Milwaukee fans ah with some brought some beer and their stomach and they're going to be a boon him big time and I don't know if I don't think you can\nPay a guy back in the series like this you don't want to get a player's suspended or you know who knows where it might lead but I Would think\nNext year in spring training if he's in the national league a and he's out here in Arizona there might be some some action taken against a man and and I also remember I don't know if you remember this or not like but\nHe got mad at 'em a pitcher one time and he actually through is bad half the guy\nAnd he pretended like oh the swing got away from him but you could see he was just same as math and of course the guy fortunately got out of the way so uh and\nWhen he was asked about it after the game he was just like I play hard\nAnd a new meanwhile he had given an interview like a half hour before that uh all these things occurred and he admitted to I think a ... chief Tom ... who does the ... will be\nAnd and the Fox um TBS or maybe it's CBS where the wherever the game was on he does a good job and he interviewed um and man he says well\nYeah I don't hustle all the time you know I don't run everything you know hard so that was kind of just his attitude and I know you've you've played a lot of all you've seen a lot of guys so to me it goes against my great I bought you\nCould actually saying it was like more what I see in slow pitch softball in like little city rec leagues like people just just nuts usually the professional level there is a lot more\nProfessionalism and to me that a citizen uncalled for\nI think you're correct you took the words of my mouth looked for him and spring training Being American league or national inches long if he's in Arizona but for the long the brewers to throw at him in spring training and they're not going to do it here unless they're up tend to not being in the base doesn't matter\nAnd again you don't want to have a got thrown out of the game so they're not happy about it and I think it was one last straw when when you have credit counselors even thinking about do I do this in my lease saying where people get mad like well\nHey what shadows kicking my players and sliding into second in you know illegally basically the ... rules and stuff so\nYou know yeah it's uncalled for he's kind of a sudden we saw it at the all star game during homerun derby and all that stuff to me if I was general manager yeah he's a good player but do I want to give a guy like that three hundred million dollars who could actually beat up his wife or girlfriend or get into a bar fight or do something else stupid because he's got a\nA lose lose cannon and you know these are things that are you doing\nYou might not I mean he's not running down the baseline probably thinking about that the first twenty steps but as he gets closer he says he's doing anything you can join his mind winning the game but it's it's not the right thing to do it really isn't\nSo I don't know I think he could injure that guy you know I mean there's crazier things you stress\nHigh after whatever oh wait let me ask you this year or two ago was an easy one of the guys are there was it was her problems in bars and I think it was more Boston New York but it was doing some crazy fights and arguments but I think there's some history I think what you brought up is there some history\nBooks can verify that and you're like you said even as buck Showalter wasn't too thrilled with what his antics are\nAnd and you can see it and the guys he seems like he should be more in the NBA or college maybe basketball or something I don't know it just seems like ... percent of baseball\nYeah yeah and but the way he talks in his attitude and his garage in his swagger and all that stuff it's it's it's not really ... I mean you could end up with a a a publicity nightmare with this guy and it's one thing to have him on your team for it than a four\nMonth stretch run you know rent a player and paying all bunch of money but what I Want to invest ten years three hundred million dollars and the guy that is a ... you could have learned from his buddy with Jones Baltimore we so community orientated and all that kind of stuff so you can learn from a lot of people are most all baseball players I have a clue they're cool", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Talk of the Town (KQNA)", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "20"}
