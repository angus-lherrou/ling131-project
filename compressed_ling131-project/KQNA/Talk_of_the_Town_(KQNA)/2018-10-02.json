get my words that you want to be harmed in any way glove in on the radio [noise]\nLet me see if I understand Dr Ford has a score or to score of inconsistent statements\nShe's credible\nBut Brett Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh said something about his drinking days that's inaccurate he's toast\nHe's denied the Supreme Court glad that about right\nNow let's go through the prosecutors memo like Sherman through Atlanta just stick with me no science Elana\nDr Ford is not offered it consistent account of when the alleged assault occurred\nIn July six text of the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid eighties entered July thirty letter does Senator Feinstein sheets\nEnter July thirty letters Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early eighties or August seventh statement to the ... river said that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties but she crossed out the word early for reason she done\nDid not explain this was because of the lawyers get a hold of her you see and they're trying to make sure everything's consistent in order to get Kavanaugh\n\nSeptember of sixteen Washington Post article reporter that Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty to notice July six mid eighties July thirty early eighties\nAugust seven early eighties but then crosses out early but September sixteen when she's being a lawyer in the summer of Nineteen eighty two wow she not only remembers the year but she remembers the season\nSimilarly the September sixteen auto reported that notes from an individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen show her describing the assault as occurring in their late teens but she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen\nWhen the assault allegedly occurred she's not turned over her therapy records for the committee to review and yet ladies and gentlemen she's wave any privilege she has one of those records because either gave them to or read them to the Washington Post there is no more attorney client privilege\nBut she's withholding why\n\nWell it's common for victims to be uncertain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season any particular year\nNow let's say the shoe was on the other foot and it was Kavanaugh would they tolerate that and say why at least credible no they wouldn't this is a big deal ladies and gentleman early eighties mid eighties early teens late teens\nThat's my memory loss\n\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name NO NAME was given her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given a hundred twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nWhy not\nDr Ford has been claims to recall that she identified judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve by the way before I read on that's her husband ... irrelevant\nAt that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press has a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took Dr Ford over Thirty years the name or assailant delayed disclosure of abuses common so this is not dispositive she writes she's nicer than I Am\n\nWhen speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific\nDr Ford testified that she told her husband about a quote unquote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post but she informed her husband that she was the victim of a physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage\nShe testified that both time she was referring to the same\nIn to the doctor for has no memory of key details or the night and questioned details I could help corroborate her account\nWe talked about this last week the memory to me it's quite selective specific details specific details that are most harmful to Kavanaugh no details at all\nOn cooperation\n\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party or how she heard about it she does not remember how she got to the party she does not remember in what House the assault allegedly took place aware of that house was located with any specificity\nPerhaps most importantly she does not remember how she got from the party back to her house her inability to remember this detail racist significant questions she told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club\nThe club is more than seven miles from her childhood home as the crow flies and she testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from a childhood home\nShe also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both but you couldn't remember\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently accent accepting the house she also has also described wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked but she has no memory of who drove or or when\nNor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as the driver no one\nGiven this all took place before cellphones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs\nAnd did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did was that she called anyone else there after that's convenient because then they can't look at phone records she does however remember a small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example\nShe testified that she had exactly one beer at the party was taking no medication at that time of the alleged assault and I will continue\nThis after the break but as I said last week during the course of this questioning by this prosecutor it was devastating and then we have the experts judicial analyst and a host to\nLive on a sheet doing what she doing she's growing up I thought I mean that doesn't mean anything to the American everything\nEverything as it did you\nAfter she testified said Kavanaugh son he comes off he's not done\nThen they tell you this woman's incompetent and confident she sent us confident\nThink the national debt is now over ... trillion dollars what happens next rising inflation drops new dollars some experts say another crashes coming what will be left the viewer investments for your children are your grandchildren\nWere you know you can't fight this not with stocks or bonds but with gold and silver coins in an IRA promote gusto precious metals\nDuring periods are great voluntarily precious metals regularly outperform stocks because they were true wealth has said that have real value\nDuring the through your recovery period after the two thousand eight crashed the Dow went up ... fibers that well gold doubled in price calling us they're now at eight five five eight five eight five eight or seven and learn how to Iraq back by physical golden sword\nCan hedge against inflation and build a true legacy for your family regained control of your financial destiny and calling us are precious metals right now and five five eighty five eighty five eighty seven and get your free gold Ira guide\nQuote unquote but she testified that doctor that actually the judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her screen\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintained that she could not hear the conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNotice she never said she turned down the music\nEither that any of them turned on the music [noise]\nHer account of who was that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post that kind of her therapy notes there were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted she told the Washington Post but the notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter that Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEntered testimony she said there were four boys and additionally ling Kaiser and herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward Dr Ford lifted Patrick PJ ...\nAs a bystander quote unquote in her statement to the political refer entered July sixth text to the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call them a bystander she did not live legal in Kaiser even though they are good friends Leland Kaiser's presidents should have been more memorable than PJ smiles\n\nDr Ford has struggled to recall important recent events relating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about our memory raises further questions about her credibility because we're talking about things that are recent a few months ago not thirty six years ago\nDr Ford struggle to remember her interactions with the Washington Post\nBack there for you and I remember she showed a full or partial set of therapy notes for the Washington Post reporter and she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter\nThe actual therapists notes her own summary of those notes the Washington Post article that portions of her therapists knows where it provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but in her testimony doctor for it cannot recall was that she summarize the nose for the reporter or showed her the actual records actually was even more and I took notes during the testimony to\nShe thought she may have summarized them over the phone or couldn't remember whether she physically handed in anything over I mean it was really preposterous we're talking about July, July sixth\n[noise] she did not remember if she actually had a copy their notes when she texted the Washington Post ... account on July six Dr Ford set in her first what's a message to the post that she quote\nHad therapy notes talking about unquote the incident when she contacted the post tip line she testified she'd reviewed a therapy notes before contact them to pose to determine whether the ... whether they mentioned anything about the alleged since then but could not remember she had a copy of these notes\nAnd she said in her ... message or merely review them inner therapists off and on wait a minute\nSo she couldn't remember on July sixth if she had a copy downloaded a copy of her therapists notes or had reviewed them in er therapist's office does anyone believe that\nShe's providing information to the Washington Post and she can't remember\nA few months ago\nIf he downloaded them from the Internet\nOr if she had reviewed them in her therapist's office\n\nCan you imagine if Kavanaugh said this about drinking back in high school\nI Can't remember if say\nWhat drinking at night I don't remember when I had three cans or six I don't remember too are far and we can hear call me saying and I learned a lot of sort of thing so I Would ask call me and I would ask Blumenthal\nMr Vietnam vet not I would ask him\nIs a little lie\nWhat does that evidence of they say more or less ladies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you this is not a memory is yeah this is an attempt by her lawyers and I think her now\nTo put a round peg in a square hole or square peg in a round hole you get the point\nIt makes no sense since July sixth it wasn't thirty six years ago wasn't even six months ago\n\nDr Ford refused to provide any of our therapy notes that the committee and that is outrageous they should be subpoenaed she waived her privileged on these therapy notes\nDr forwards explanation 'em by the way I'm sure Shelley White House solid Whitehouse of Rhode Island school of what am I supposed to\nDo rely on a ladder can't rely\nThat's a trek where they actually asked by God\nI don't I have another drink right a man not in the public\nDr forwards explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions she claimed originally that she wished for her story to remain confidential\nBut the person operating the tip line of the Washington Post was the first person other than her therapist or a husband to whom she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker she testified that she had a sense of urgency to relate the information to the Senate and the president quote unquote she did not contact the Senate\nBecause she claimed she quote did not know how to do that unquote it's very hard\nTo contact the Senate\nYou could what we called Google\nYou could what we called Google you could call what we could ... you could what we call call even for one the one you could call or ask one of the people on the beach who you consult apparently frequently uh millions of people contact the Senate every every year\nWe have our living surges\nGo ahead and Google and phone number for the Senate it's right there\nShe did not contact the Senate\nDidn't she did not explain why she knew how to contact her congresswoman but not a senator Dr Ford cannot remember of she was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraph she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred the same day as her grandmother's funeral the day after her grandmother's funeral\nAgain these are all recent\nThere were also been inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving\nSays the prosecutor Dr forge description\nOf the physiological impact to the event raises questions says the prosecutor she maintains that she suffers from anxiety claustrophobia post traumatic stress disorder PATS the the data the hearing was delayed because of the committee was informed that her symptoms prevent her from flying\nBut she agreed doing her testimony that she flies quote fairly frequently for her hobbies and work unquote she flies to the mid Atlantic at least once a year to visit her family she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica she also flew to Washington DC for the hearing\nNo to that her attorneys refused a private hearing or interview Dr Ford testified that she was not clear whether investigators were willing to travel to California interviewer\nIt therefore is not clear that her attorneys ever communicated trim and Grassley has offered to send investigators the meter in California or wherever she wanted to meet to conduct the interview we pointed all these points out they're important\nShe alleges that she struggled academically in college but she's never made any similar claim about her two years of high school\nIt's significant that she used the word contributed contributed once you describe the ... the psychological impact of the incident of the Washington Post use of the word contributed rather than cause suggests that other life events may contribute toward symptoms and one question on that point\nSaid that she could think of nothing as striking as the alleged assault in other words she wouldn't that to it\n\nAnd the prosecutor ads the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr forge attorneys are likely affect the doctor forwards account and she attached a very detailed timetable\nOnce\nThe lawyers and the Democrats\nGot a hold of events\nI'll be right back [noise] month\n\n[noise] like I'm going to grow it was friday and Saturday [noise]
