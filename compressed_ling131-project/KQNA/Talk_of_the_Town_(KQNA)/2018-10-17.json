also known as cannon fodder in the Massachusetts Senate race what happened\nHappened Massachusetts once upon a time not all that long ago there was some semblance of prime into Elizabeth Warren\nAnd at this point I here's a question\nThe Republican in this race has been trailing by an average somewhere in the neighborhood about twenty five points or any chance\nThat the backfires enough to move the needle even reasonably\nJeff I ended up calling today and Elizabeth Warren to drop out on the back of her being Pocahontas in her entire test backfiring on her quite spectacularly but you take a

now that her claims of being in the end of the Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this fraud against the American public Harvard called her a person of color amazing God and would not have taken her otherwise and again this is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal is not just oh it's another politician line it's not that\nA lie it they fraud but she has kept up her entire adult life\nBut secondly it's not a victimless situation she committed fraud\nFor personal gain every single step of

Nation\nAlready feeling that Elizabeth Warren\nSometimes referred to as Pocahontas\nYou can just see him and hear him saying that to king is a complete and total fraud\nYou know not to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do take it straight from the tribe that she claims to be part of\nA kind of tough to death for her to rally back from that one by the way the the president in terms of choice holy cow you had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniels\nNow to be way forward to was I guess horse face that that that

their own talent on their own weight is down or their connection with the people and how to solve issues and stuff it it curtailing\nGod Bless you that this is the first time you've gone through a main\nThis is one of my my all time favorite called quite honestly\nUh it Twenty one years of doing radio this is a moment that makes my heart saying your twenty two you were in science and you're in Washington DC and you're making political sense how did that happen in and do you have any friends\nI have plenty of friends or where there is a small revolution uh but uh uh I think it a lot of credit and my parents you know a lot of them\nAre not just to frustrate you need more ah the word pedigree is actually a like a technical term that we use in genetics on it because the people don't really see the difference between our animal than people that I think though that were you pedigree for people and animals\nOver time so you have a dog you and me baby and nothing but anyway uh the amazing Josh I mean really\nA longer view and spread your wisdom to it as many people as possible lord knows we could use that they're a great call great gal All right let's go to a Peter and Illinois alright theater I uh I it's a tough act to follow so you've got to up your game that was a pretty impressive called there\nWhen you were talking about the brain dead voters in Massachusetts you have to remember that the you're the same people who after Teddy Kennedy left a woman to drown and the bottom of Chappaquiddick reelected him six times back to the United States Senate [laughter]\nYou raise a very important and interesting point in fact the only thing that he did get caught disqualified problem was a well all to Billy his presidential bid at that point to add to your right if you could also going to get away with Chappaquiddick and you'd still get reelected in Massachusetts\nAh you know I'd I defer to the vet is uh that that is an excellent point which by the way that that whole thing and the and it's fascinating by the way every now and then uh because of the glass named people will think that\nUh because I'm In broadcasting I Am directly related to the person who helped break that story one Roger Mudd back then and I'm not I'm not a somewhere in the very outer lying a bar or a genetic silver pedigree you might say there would be a some overlap but actually\nI Am a more aligned with them for me a ... there is one infamous member of the the family that I Am directly related to him that would be Dr Samuel but\nWho may be familiar was one of the uh go conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was a doctor actually fix booth flag and end up having a whole kind of interesting deal where you went to the door to go and\n... that's the story for a different day but anyway that is my ... should not Roger Mudd who broke Chappaquiddick which by the way it's kind of interesting people thought after that\nOh Roger must be the best Republican guys now\nMay not signed up to this day he's still a Democrat it said that he was doing a job at magic that by thing actually has some people in the news business that did their job\nAnd it got really you know yeah yeah the Kennedy was running against a quarter of their\nFriendship the guy that was my nickname for him in in Georgia by the way from suburban Atlanta so a nickname was always kept in being in fact one of my favorite parodies from\nMany years ago was that I remember the ... and ... enjoy commercials you know sometimes you feel like an egg I kind of had some ... like that you know sometimes you feel like and that sometimes you are one you know in plenty of Jimmy Carter is um so you could throw in there are so anyway it's just a as an aside\nBut yeah so that cleared the path for Jimmy Carter to do you win the nomination again for the Democrats and get his butt whipped by one Ronald Reagan so\n... was happily ever after for the country not so heavily I ever after for Massachusetts or for the United States Senate\nAh because to your point he continued to win time after time after time All right so a couple of things here\nWhen we are taking like three weeks away from election day\nThere's a lot to keep in perspective and one of the things that I Will frequently point out you um have hurt me anywhere along the way you you probably heard me say things like that they are two sides of stories that are one side to facts tend to be pretty a\nParticular about the facts you know you don't get any kind of like you know ... we're really not having a conversation about you being a Native American Elizabeth Warren because while you're not\nRight so you you can't you would that that would embrace Abbas permits which didn't take me to the premise of the premise of anything is false than anything built upon it is as well\nIntroduce the sliding scale of morality which means that and people always wonder how is it you don't have somebody who\nUnder best day seems like a pretty good person and then several underway wow they really are awful and they're stabbing you in the back in their line and and that's because you have some people that have the moral compass that is stronger than others you know let's say that on our best day we're in eight out of a one ...\nOthers you know let's say that on our best day we're in eight out of a one through ten ten being perfect which none of us are well if you're an eight even on a bad day you're probably not going to be worse than a by therefore when you're at your weakest you're worth checking to go out of your way to hurt somebody else for your own personal benefit well then you bring it to somebody like oh I don't know\nElizabeth Warren clearly clearly under sliding scale morality one of us with Warren\nPretty a moral person because she is willing to hurt somebody that's just that she's wanting to commit fraud it's that she is willing to hurt somebody for personal gain and once again\nNot a victimless crime to get somewhere\nMany times over all throughout her academic career throughout her professional career leading up to the time that she was the United states senator she took the thought of it actually Native American\nSo somebody did get hurt it's pretty moral on finding skill of morality that is the willingness to hurt somebody\nFor your own personal benefit\nPut it all together two sides of stories one side effects the premise and the sliding scale morality ultimately get is that yes\nSometimes\nReferred to was Pocahontas\nA bad person\nWho was pretty amoral\nAnd again two types of stories on side effects and you want to be the person who ... fans taking the thought of it actual Native American\nAnd you can justify that not bringing on we'll have that conversation can we can also talk to the Cherokee Nation as well because they have a few things to say about it will give the the conversation not by mud in for the great one month\nHim no\nI've had
