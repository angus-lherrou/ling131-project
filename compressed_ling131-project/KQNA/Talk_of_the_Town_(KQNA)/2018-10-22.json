Wisconsin Josh here next up on the market within\nShow I'm Larry O'Connor Hi Larry how are you\nI'm good I I'm concerned though because if the Democrats do get the majority in the house this is going to be a rough two years\nAnd I have an idea um as talking to your string color and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show in Detroit when it's ran by businessmen like Donald Trump say in Henry Ford and the strength that Detroit once had and then one Democrat liberal take over\nAnd how it just falls into corruption in squalor and just show them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they'd on how their mouth\nIf we let politician and take over you get your choice if you let Republicans take over and have ideas get Foxconn and these beautiful jobs that we're getting a little shocked and I yeah I Wish they would tell that more and more and more and they don't\n[noise] yeah and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs in his incredible turn around what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been phenomenal\nYeah and we saw Scott the number and Madison there with all of them and that took on our capital and we fought right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that choice is second half of the term Donald Trump if it if we fight the good fight and lord on November ... that'll happen\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for coming into the market within show ya I vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of the Scott Walker or the governorship but that was back when I was working with Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Andrew got on a plane\nThe next day a ton of all a text message I'm going to Madison\nIn the winter in Southern California guy\nWho asked her why are you going to Madison looked at what's going on there look at the mobs look at the riots look at the ...\nLook at Scott Walker needs us Republicans need us conservatives who are trying to bring sane rational governance to the state of Wisconsin need us and he sure did go there by the way right next door to you there are Josh over in Michigan\nThis is a remarkable thing\nYou know everywhere you go right now on cable news broadcast news all over the Internet who do you hear about running for Senate this young upstart appealing good looking guy who's who's a defining the odds and has a real chance to win\nAll you're hearing about is this guy Beto O'Rourke bitter rug doesn't have a chance to win and Texas\nBigger and better or work is not going to win\nThe Senate seat in Texas\nIt's all made for TV we've seen this game before every\nTwo years every election they tell us about the new rising star in Texas was finally going to take paint Texas blue you know when Hillary Clinton was a deciding not to do any sort of polling or appearances in Wisconsin Pennsylvania will not Pennsylvania cheap to the parents in Wisconsin or Michigan\nOr in it and she was actually at that time\nContemplating spending more money in Texas because she was so sure she was going to win Texas and Georgia in Arizona and she ... she wanted to to this was going to be a transformative election with Hillary Clinton and the remaking of the map\nWe hear this all the time but but it's not true\nAnd meanwhile in Michigan there's this guy John James the last poll there showed him in single digits now this guy a running against Debbie Stabenow I mean he is he's a former military [noise] uh they did combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues are they here I Want to play a little bit of of him because because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing this fake narrative that the Democrats are really not that Texas is moving blue Texas is going to be a democratic state Texas is not the same Texas because the Democrats\nBe a democratic state Texas is not the same Texas because the Democratic that demographic changes because ah because of all of the radical conservative policies that have heard that they would they have it I mean people are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas\nBecause of the economy there is one of the only state to persevere through the eight ... years of ... because they had Republicans in charge of that said there was no way the people of Texas would reverse that trend but also because they hate Ted Cruz\nThe media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're pumping this beta will work guy up and meanwhile listen I got a little bit of a John James this a really impressive guy in Michigan\nReal leadership is what's needed in Washington in order to ensure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity American exceptionalism is not entitled\nAmerican exceptionalism is on\nThere was a time in America we still do who is right without any sort of political motivation a reservation we waste wars on cable now known each other services for self we they're greatly policemen wisely we lost deeply into the man who was on this is what our president means when he talks about making America great\nAre you kidding me about dreaming I mean do you hear this guy about doing the African American young handsome odd articulate had as a perfect on the issues perfect on his love for this country full support of the president\n... I mean I come on if he if he were running against Ted Cruz do you think we hear more about John James\nIf he were a Democrat do you think we'd be hearing a little bit more why why is everyone obsessed with better work when he was basically running junk just far behind Ted Cruz and the latest polls then John James is running behind Debbie Stabenow and you know the answer to that question\nYou know very well the answer to that question [noise]\nHow about GM down in uh Fernando Florida I'm Larry O'Connor you're listening to the market within show what is a gym\nI just don't want to tell you what the Democrats are the Republicans should be talking about yeah\nIs what the Democrats are not talking about about gun control the economy jobs unemployment people for one in case you know the media is driving the narrative and they're doing that in the pocket of the Democrats\nYet Jim you're right all the Republicans need to know what they should be talking about in the next to the two and a half weeks you're absolutely right all the things that the Democrats are avoiding and that includes the fight over judge Kavanaugh now justice cabin on notice how no one talks about that anymore it's completely disappeared why do you think that is Jim\nOh geez I Wonder if it goes to the media is driving it there are saying okay well that's not important anymore that might make the the conservatives rushed to the rules and you know [noise] disregard for what they're what they're trying to do\nThank you Jim appreciate the call thanks for calling the ... I got a little bit more in fact I Want to play a little bit more this guy John James he has not gotten enough national exposure or I Know that all the great listeners and W. J. are out of Detroit Michigan my home town my birthplace where I'm originally from\nUh I I Know you know about this guy but it's time we gave him the national exposure that he's not getting from broadcast and cable here's a limit on play a little bit more of this great great candidate John James for Senate\nIn Michigan and I'm going to juxtapose that with Cory Booker\nCory Booker another rising star in the Democratic party Spartacus oh he's our great hope for twenty twenty he's running against Donald Trump and he's young and he's handsome and he's articulated he's African American he he's everything that John James really is [noise]\nIs what they claim Cory Booker is and I want to play you these two side by side\nThat the John James message bit is lost right now and the Cory Booker message that they just can't get enough of", "show_name": "Talk of the Town (KQNA)", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "22"}
