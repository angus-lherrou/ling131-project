African American it might be elected from the Senate Michigan\nJohn James\nWhere is he in the media where is he in the national media this guy is great\nUnlike Gillum he served his country in combat unlike Gillum he actually created real business since he's a capitalist unlike Gillum he really is uniting people and give them gets all the attention of why\nBecause they just left wing students that's why a word that he used during the debate shoot\nBut John James running for the Senate Michigan how much time does he get on CNN how much time does he get it on MSNBC the New York times the

you're done\nTo try and parents rubs risk free call one eight hundred six\nSeven eight nine ... nine six nine that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six\n\nThis whole idea of freedom of the press where do they come from\nThose white slave owners\nAlthough Franklin ever owned slaves but you get the point\nThat's for freedom of the press came from freedom and the press freedom of speech were synonymous\nAnd they were promoting a republic they were promoting individual liberty they were promoting private property rights they were fighting the ... positions in viewpoints\nThey were fighting them\n\nAlmost every day when you read a so-called news article each trashing our country now let's go back to the first sentence for this piece on box America has a massive growing racial wealth gap let me ask you a question why do people\nRisk their lives to come here because that senses telling you that America is racist and there's not equal opportunity in America that's what that senses telling why do people of color AKA non whites\nWhy are they flooding into America\nWhy are they leaving Guatemala and Honduras and Mexico in one\nCountry after another in central and South America why are they leaving one country after another on the African continent why they're leaving one country after another in Southeast Asia\nEven China why are all these people coming to the United states if there is a massive growing racial wealth gap\nThere is no opportunity for non whites is that it\n\nOne of the problems we have in this country\nThanks to the left weather in the media or entertainment and elsewhere is a lack of promoting assimilation\nI'll lack of promoting assimilation learning English\nLearning American laws learning American practices and bracing American culture I mean after all you came to you in the United states to escape\nThe culture of your birthplace right\nIsn't that where the refugee is isn't that what an illegal alien does\nOtherwise white coming to America\nAnd America you see is so racist\n\nThat has Brock Obama and Joe Biden used to say by twenty forty four\nWhite people will be in the minority\nThere are so race obsessed with America is so racist white Americans allow that\nBecause America as a country is not racist\nThat's why\n\nPeople should be encouraged to embrace capitalism they should be encouraged to embrace entrepreneur ship they should be encouraged to embrace the private sector the profit motive creativity productivity rather than government government government\nBecause the vast majority of people do not succeed by getting a government check\nIt destroys them it destroys initiative\nIt destroyed independent thinking\nIt destroys the human spirit\nWhich is exactly why the left pushes it\nSo let's go back to this story America has a massive growing racial wealth gap\nNow for the left of course that means more government more redistribution higher taxes more regular you know\nAnd more and more and more than ...\nGoes on the median white family today holds nearly ten times the wealth of the median black for\n\nSenator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing that gap\nThat caught my attention his idea is to get lower income kids\nKids a sizable nest egg nearly fifty thousand dollars in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition\nDid you hear this we use a million but there's\nThese they call them opportunity accounts\nThey don't call these marches accounts they call them opportunity account what theoretically now this is the article this is the news article\nIt doesn't say that it's an opinion piece these opportunity accounts with theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grow up in wealthier home\nSounds cool right equality\nIt would be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty bunkers that an interview with box we can rapidly bring security into those families lives and that is really exciting to me\nNow that will never be any discussion of where this money comes from\nNever nobody cares\nWhat kind of taxes for it to be increased who cares\nWhat kind of ...\nThe increase who cares\nWhat kind of additional debt will have to be accumulated who cares\nNone of it matters\nWe're talking about\nResults economic equality we're not talking about liberty\nDon't confuse us with liberty don't confuse us with markets don't confuse us with opportunities no don't you see\nWe have a racist country\nWe need to take money\nGive it to poor people poor kids up to fifty thousand dollars\nSo they can move into the middle class who see such simple\nOne and I think of this why didn't anybody like that these are opportunity accounts after all ladies and gentlemen were coming into the the modern era modern modern era I guess\nEconomics don't matter that does it matter tax rates are irrelevant\nWe need an opportunity account\nUp to fifty thousand dollars a kid\nWhat's the big deal at wall right it free college\nAt ...\nAnd ... open borders\nIs your country to what makes this country different is an opportunity accounts would make this country different news and governance centralized healthcare what makes this country different
