three one one Seventy seven three one two three one well now I have a question for your folks [noise]\nI think it's a question I I Will be the first on radio at least ask but before I ask it I Want to look at this here with you a word right scoop her body Brian has a list of all the crimes committed\nBy the domestic terrorists I'm not talking about bill heirs and the bernadine darn I'm not talking about the F. A. L. and they got all the parts from Clinton and so we're not talking about this guy\nAnd boy I'll tell you what\nHe committed a felony in Nineteen Ninety One domestic violence in Nineteen Ninety four numerous parking violations another Tony in two thousand four sky was a drug court more parking violations a head of foreclosure let's see uh\nLike criminal traffic violation other traffic traffic traffic has on and on\nTraffic violation other traffic traffic traffic has on and on the other third degree felony and other parking violation misdemeanors recently he's twenty four houses guy not in prison he's committed multiple felonies but here's a bigger question for you ladies and gentlemen\nAnd this was sent to me by a buddy of mine the New York times and other news outlets keep referring to this guy is a registered Republican right\n[noise] but he's previously been convicted of felonies according to their same store and these other stores\n\nSo he should have been removed from the voter registration lists because he lost his right to vote in Florida\nYou know the Democrats and the blue states in the blue cities they keep pushing for the rights of felons to vote after they've served their time you've heard it over and over again you heard Gillum mentioned it and one of the debate summer even pushing for the right of felons to vote while they're in prison\nBut let's talk about the facts here it's Florida he should have been removed from the voter registration list because he lost his right to vote and it could not be restored until and unless he applied to the Florida clemency board and was approved\nFlorida is one of the states that does not does not automatically restore the writer felons to vote when they get out of prison even though it soon Mike by the way it goes to the left but a referendum on the upcoming November ballot Arnie of honor nice to do exactly that\nSo unless you had his right to vote restored he can't be a registered Republican quote unquote so I Would ask the news media out there the New York slime constipated news network MS tell us they all of you\nHow did he become a registered Republican\nWhen I was supposed to be stripped off the off the rolls\nNow once again\nYou don't automatically restore the ride of Ellen's the vote when they get out of prison in Florida even though the left has a ballot measure right now for this election to do exactly that\nSo that's not job would have had as right to vote restored Yvette past\nHe's a registered Republican\nWe need leaders will help us fix the border prices just in cinema opposed funding to help law enforcement fight the drug cartels and she supported dangerous sanctuary city policies here since the number is weak on borders security\nNational border patrol council was proud

vanish now before you get busy with the holidays and those bags and puffing is gone and for results in less than twelve hours\nThat genocide immediate effects has also yours free to go to genocide dot

America cut Thirteen go\nUm I've got to let them know and I I I probably know both police accountability\nBut law enforcement society cannot work quite frankly law enforcement can do the job if it does not have any trusting relationship with the community at the time that a law enforcement official and to go to a weapon to have done to all the time to what they either and they have already have to go too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they had a fire in community in in his id is supposed to be able to bring most situations you\nKnow this is sick and this man is sick from a philosophical ideological perspective eased a radical\n\nYou sick from a philosophical and political perspective\nHe is sick from a philosophical and political perspective he knows this not to be true\nYou have criminals in society including in poor neighborhoods who cannot be reason with rapists\nMurderers wouldn't be rape is would be murders robbers wouldn't be robbers and so forth and so on at the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon toward gone to a baton to a taser then they have already\nGone too far by their very presence\nBy the very trust that they inspiring community and that society they were supposed to be able to bring most situations the heel\nHere this incredible\nAnd Debbie Wasserman Schultz has no problem with this she thinks he's great because of the news conference today in support of Andrew Gillum here's what she had to say cut twelve go\nI just want to share with you [noise]\nHow heartbroken I was I had my incredible fast [noise]\nWho are taking care of the people I represent every single day [noise]\nAnd deal with that kind of her [noise]\nWhile serving like insects\nAnd so we're going to make sure\nIt's one of the reasons that we have to like the angel meal um\nGot [noise]\nNice cars that we can stand up for the values of the community\nAnd the values of the community is to trash the cops even in the face of this\nThat's a press conference today and they weren't Debbie Wasserman Schultz to know that she's a victim that her staff Herseth victims but\nSo was Donald Trump junior victim and so is Eric Trump a victim and so it was Donald Trump the victim\nAnd so's Lara Trump of victim\nAnd so was Marco Rubio victim is somewhat Susan Collins a victim\nAnd so as General Mattis a victim\nAnd I just don't remember all the outpouring of anguish by the media I just don't remember it\nDay in and day out\nNow this isn't about moral relativism or anything of this or this is about absolute bold faced boy ten hypocrisy\nAnd Steve ... was actually shot and almost murdered as others were shot\nLuckily this cook\nEither didn't know what he was doing or didn't intend for these bombs to go either way\nAnd the New York times tells us he's a registered Republican I'm trying to figure out how that can be\nI'm not saying he's not I just want to know more\nBecause once you're a felon and Florida you're not automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically to the far like clemency board did he do that did he get approval\nI mean this guy in two thousand two\nIn two thousand two he made a bomb threat [noise] he made a bomb threat\nIn two thousand two\n\nHe's not a clean slate\nThe way he was more the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric and whoever was doing this\nThat was the insinuation that have pushed him over the edge and that this is what causes it sort of know what does it has multiple felonies in his past\nThe guy threatened to use a bomb in two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty uh\nLong before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States\nHe was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place project or discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd as pointed out in the Washington Examiner\nHe made the bomb threat because\nHe was angry at a party utility worker St people do not make the threats\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum medical you Andrew Andrew Gillum\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers or Billy clubs or anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make the guy he'll be more you know community relations more community relations\nTo tell you what\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would not from a conspiracy perspective or anything else I just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slams the Washington compost constipated news network MSL honesty and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that than I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first reported the tell us how [noise]\nWas because Florida [noise]\nIs not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is because um [noise]\nPeople on the uh Florida clemency board game as registration out what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one should be able to vote [noise]\nI'll be right back when you take one atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen

backslash Levin today\nAnd attack regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they check the thigh and then they're attacked by that\nAnd that that's my point that you know they're going back and forth but at the end the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it's true it's directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrats\nAre they I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a a a public utility because he was angry with the worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the less hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so I'm we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't doubt it I don't support that at all it was more of the ... so you know you're you're asking why do we push the buttons why go to our anyway why ever attacked orders that doesn't have the right way to do things the way that we're fed up\nWhile the media like to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr sucker over at CNN and a clown that runs them and tell us the they've decided that they are political operations and that they want to um [noise]\nUh they want they want to play to a base the radical left coup Democrat base and that's what they've decided to do\nOr they're not really news operations they know damn well that Don limited as a joke they know damn well the Jake Tapper more and more has become a joke like what they run at night Steven Kobe or the Spock of ah\nWith the goofy years may I yes I Will the Spock of a

also\nSees because many of them are and very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook\nWhat I'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax it well if that's already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how do how do you push them into that system\nWhile I'm thing even for legal immigration coming to this country we gotta have something going in\nFor the phone while we need is to limit the

was to some extent\nOr a matter of us being able to just slow things down assimilate people within our system to take a look at how it's shaking out in terms of our school systems\nTerms of law enforcement terms a local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but what's happening is the left is flooding the field more and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never an American history we actually have a political party that you cheering illegality\nCheering so I I I don't but I appreciate your call people come up with tax schemes and
