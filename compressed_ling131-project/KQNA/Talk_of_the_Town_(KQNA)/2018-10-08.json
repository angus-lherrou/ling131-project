thinking of the folks who was dubbed up in a surprise visit awake\nLindsey Graham at the Atlantic and been in a deep the on Wednesday we'll blow yourself after he was funny because here you had Cory Booker ... and and he told us he was having his ... his moment\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like actually wants to give up the hearing and he's continued it's kinda like Lindsey Graham's like the grandson a difference and you know the Grinch his heart grew three ... three times a day\nLet's say that to Lindsey Graham's\nIntestinal fortitude grew three times\nOver the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\nI Am very much based on information on the arguments the information that provide you my opinions all based on information\nAnd one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always track on Supreme Court nominees and you you may be a ... whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion\nOn any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd what was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination by President Trump\nWe had four percent more Americans\nSay that he should be confirmed the not the case of that debate find that's where we've started\nAfter we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty and senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus\nFour percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed the not in other words\nDespite the fact that a couple of months when by the by the fact that they uh you know what else forgets on them\nIt didn't change public opinion at all not at all\nAnd that was interesting because\nAs consistent as that was we did see with Christine for delegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning my yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing\nWe did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory and Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw about what's in the mid shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed\nAgain prior to the testimony\nAfter after everything that the media\nAnd the politicians did\nWhere are we today\nThat's kind of interesting\nBy a forty six to forty five marching\nAmericans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed\nNow they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as\nPublic opinion despite all the emotions all the emotions the all the nonsense sport gets across the board to gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nWhat's instructive inside of that seven percent\nTo pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating\nIs when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us\nAnd in this particular case the United States Senate\nPretty much what the American people want to have happen near\nBy a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance to the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it\nSo that part I think it's it's like a graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation\nIs where the focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically\nOne of the most common questions I ever receive has to do\nWith persuading people politically how do you do it\nThe easiest way to tell you how not to do it\nWho is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably the loudest people in your life that oppose you\nHow's that worked out for you\nFor the angry leftist\nBut you argue politics where if\nYou ever get anywhere you get angry\nDo you think they're one of the folks as part of that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place [noise]\nNow I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they are in our lives and our universe\nWants to be open minded first\nAnd coming up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive\nAnd who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy [noise] I Am Brian mud and\nThe gray one more global\nWhen you listen to what David aspirin Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an

opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right\nThere is getting the wage growth\nThe bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this kind of an odd situation to articulate\nWhat's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of St sexual assault may not be awful right\nCan be pretty bad\nRight I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know having all\nThe anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience so tell me why mark what attracts you to do to\nFix the will of you and I wanted to say that uh I live in a very carefully to the who is in a a\nA colon senator Collins is a [noise] a death or two about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a\nQuite impressed by it he laid it out very precisely he was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and build the what her diligent all the time ... than getting a\nComing to her a conclusion quality interviews he did and all the meetings he went to [noise] until I found it very at applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me [noise]\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that part of this process\nI mean she\nWas on ... and\nPoint by point by point from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations were going to oppose regardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee\nMentioned that even senators got out ahead to one of them even got out ahead of the main being announced when they were saying that they were opposed all the way through\nPoint by point by point why Christine Ford was not credible in terms of who were allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been\nThe top of joining in the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them it was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a month to view if you\nMissed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating and again I had never heard at senator deliver a better speech not ever\nI didn't agree with absolutely everything she said\nBut what's principles\nIt was details it was well thought out\nAnd almost everything there was inarguable\nAnd I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWouldn't go down to money to go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nHey Brian thanks a lot harder to a premature echo what the last caller so to go about my respect and admiration for callers I mean that's increased by water or cold after ... girl gr for about ... percent of that I knew her vote was going to be a year and I'm proud of our sticker driving down the road you know\nThe only other thing bigger than what Susan called his food or today was when the twentieth main author Joshua ... protectors of our ... your your army Gettysburg little round top cross preserving the junior so am I really admire her and I'm Glad she did\nWell that's a pretty big moment in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way a how are the folks in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] oh yeah the skaters are kind of a ramp butter in big but a a sort of the cold weather gets in on her I think er I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington\nA Robert Charlotte but uh I was in the marine corps are bracing for over ... ... pretty good\nThey're recovering pretty good for Jacksonville you or your real areas there all the water retreated and the cover of area so I talked to a friend over there everything's everything's back hope for slowly but surely record normal\nAppreciate your service thank you for listening to and sharing your thoughts as well and may God Bless you know the folks there\nI Lived in Wilmington for a very short time and when I saw what was going on and heard that it was an island are pretty unimaginable glad that ah folks during the get back together after the hurricane in North Carolina All right let's go\nTo Jake Jake ... in California Welcome to the show\nHi hey yeah yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about ... and Ford and as far as their allegations are concerned but I had a little different take on a not so much to go after her but to ah go after anybody in the future\nThat might think that they can pick people up to putting out false allegations and not have to pay a price\nI think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a path even do Kavanaugh's going clear that thing because he's always going to have disdain that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that\nThe stain that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegation regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principal and again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise\nThat should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury\nConduct investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go unchecked what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your or none of your witness a\nWould know the windows period that corroborate any of that information I mean that's a problem that's not acceptable in this country appreciate you are you listening in and checking in\nComing up we'll continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on Brett Kavanaugh on the situation as we get ready for the vote are now under a day away will be approximately five o'clock\nEastern time tomorrow because once again the whole process has been much bigger than brick happened on the Supreme Court it's become about all of us will talk about it next time probably mud and for the great one month\nHim no\nDoubt pollen we spend most of our time
