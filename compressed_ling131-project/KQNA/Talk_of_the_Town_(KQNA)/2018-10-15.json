see how far we've come to think about this for a moment George Bush doesn't like black people and we take a look at prosperity and the unemployment rate rock above a hated black people\nThat go down drug Donald Trump love and black people\nI mean human county that man\nAnd you know who else Donald Trump boss\nDonald Trump gloves women\nYou know George Bush I liked women\nWe take a look at unemployment right\nThey go to the economy and you like swimming\nWell sure I I I think\nI don't think brought to Obama liked woman\nBut don't drop Donald Trump blobs women\nI'm Still talking about the economy and unemployment rates you'd spry mud infer Margot then let's talk about the things real quick or this is kind of important in the context of these conversations while the media wants to make it all about how much\nProfanity of Kanye West\nWhat is costing you pointed out\nI was born it out\nThat hey you know from an economic standpoint\nPeople are lifted up and they have opportunity oh okay so where\nHave we have the most opportunity for black adults\nWill shoot that Donald Trump\nHere or all of the demographics\nThat are experiencing record low unemployment rates this year\nYes black adult\nBorn born adults and even Native Americans\nIf we weren't going to find\nThat Donald Trump doesn't like the Donald Trump doesn't love\nApparently Donald Trump\nDoesn't like why people\nGeorge Bush doesn't like black people but Donald Trump he doesn't like why people\nThink about the only place will have a record low unemployment rates right now\nBeing that you are probably more students than the average person out there you know how the game has always been plight\nDemocrat politics are what their identity politics they're meant to divide their mental cause friction division they're meant also importantly to do what key people down\nWhat we've seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their mind remember was talking about just a few minutes ago\nSliding scale morality but also finding people who are open minded now historically we've seen\nWell over Ninety percent\nOf black adult both for Democrats\nIt with any group of people\nWe ever agree Ninety percent of the time\nThat for decades now we'd had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus a time for a Democrat\nNo open mindedness no division of thought\nBuying into the identity politics\nBut nothing ever changed\nAnd we see that we're still the country where a man\nFrom the poorest neighborhood in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and a Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world\nSelf made near billionaire\nAnd be a Republican\nAnd that is the problem\nBecause that is where the Democrats get exposed\nAs soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity\nAnd the one thing if we take a look at George W. Bush\nAdministration\nAt the politics of usually as usual at that time\nWe didn't see the inner cities being lifted up\nWhat Donald Trump run on what the campaign on the inner cities weren't going to lift them up\nMinority unemployment rate it's real it's happening George Bush might not have like five people with Donald Trump\nOf black people telling us loves Donald Trump mud ever the gray one mark a little bit more I\nMean have you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth\nThe word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nWell my friend Dr Larry ... president of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that and that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nHad Hillsdale they understand that true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is fourth he'll tell students are challenged to discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate unrelated things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at low vision for Hillsdale dot com that's L. E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keep an economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need all\nOkay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nYou see somebody like John Yang who obviously is not an ideologue Johnny ... not a Republican\nItaly's not traditionally\nSomebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people\nBut somebody who loves Donald Trump\nYou see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man\nBecause he did what couldn't be done\nHe made a difference in acting policy they gave people a chance\nAnd that means that you create open minds that means that when you hear that wow Donald Trump's approval rating among black adult is in double digits all decided\nThat could be ... that could be enough\nLet's go to Nancy in Indiana Nancy go\n[noise] Hi this is Nancy from evidence DNA or and I am so happy to talk to you but you're talking about moral sliding moral compass\n... Democrat\nYeah so you you got the scale of morality we're all somewhere on that scale between one and two\nRight but you gotta have morals to be on it [laughter]\n[noise] okay I uh I guess I see where you're coming from a appreciate the Nancy [laughter] All right let's go to Don and New Jersey Don go\nHey good afternoon I'm human trafficking Daniel ... on ... it was a captain Harris says corruption tearing attracted to last for ten minutes timeline them out so if I can quote un county six months without a way to hold her three hundred years I'm not sure I'm from ...

Brazil or we'll see you order a psych exam\nAnd the way in the county six months I'm like I said I'm sitting here at the psych\nYourself and I want to Chicago so I Would have that one of the hospital will give you a little contract forever guys trying to push him who am I to my friend that's a contract\nTo settle this is an interesting they you know it's kind of like a ... if the euro west of the Rockies dial a but I I Will and will take a look done a in a night\nYou wish you well I'm ... and design and scale morality uh I think you're dealing with some very amoral individuals I Would say that if we're talking on the scale of one to tend the folks that you are dealing with probably starting out around the U.S the way and so I don't like your chances of ever getting very far with those books but uh\nHey uh you know if for now\nWe're going to try to find those folks who are at least in late you know five six is on our overall sliding scale morality it's right away if you missed it at the onto the show it's going to my theme that I'm tiny things into today\nI like to say there are two types of stories one side of the facts and you have the premise that the premise of anything is faulty built upon it will fail to but they're also with a sliding scale of morality in similar on it\nWe exist and we'll read or best maybe we're good people will rent or worst maybe we're not quite as good but the differences are weeps somebody who will end up hurting others what we see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt other than we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well\nAnd a lot of that happen through misinformation\nSo let's talk about the employment situation again for a second record low unemployment for minorities\nBlack and employment rate at all time lives\nIn somewhere along the way\nYou have Donald Trump that brings out the best and many of these minority communities you have somebody who actually sat down with Kim ... which many of us were skeptical about at the onset and something constructive came out of it\nNow you have gone you west who goes into the oval office and\nSomething constructive might come out of it but more to the point the more open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture\nOr minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it but the better the opportunity for the entire country\nOpen minds equal better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we adhered to pull politics and to people that start out on that sliding scale of morality\nPeople that start out on that sliding scale of morality from a really negative plates\nWhere are we going to be taken\nFor the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer said he believed her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you have people that started out in that sliding scale morality and an amoral plates and have taken their politics and those folks left with them\nThat's not good Donald Trump taken whole minority communities including black adult women Hispanics\nEven Native Americans to new heights economically that they had never seen before that the jade and change it and that's the difference and that's\nThe irony of Donald Trump who in his own personal life maybe not the most moral man\nAnd the grand scheme of that sliding scale morality\nOne politician has kept more promises inside of two years then that man that always told me that there are two kinds of people you got people who will tell you something and you can't believe it and you got people who will tell you something and you can take it to the bank\nWhen Donald Trump says something\nYou can pretty much take it to the bank
