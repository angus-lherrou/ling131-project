our system of government this week federal is forty six\nAnd the federal is paper Madison is wrong so here's where Madison is wrong and Madison argues in favor of the notion that the people will be more loyal to the states in the house and the federal government that still true in like Texas and natural pretty much anywhere else I live in California and no one is more oil to the state of California than they are to the federal government no one Madison Ted\nCruz no weapon decency requires at the event in every case it should be opposed to depend on the sentiments in sanction\nOf their common constituent mental considerations the tides dose adjusted ... plated beyond doubt that the first and my natural attachment of the people will be the governments there a second\nThe first and my natural attachment of the people will be the governments of their respective state than originally of course this was true at the time of the founding people were more well to the state of Virginia and they were to the federal government which is why no she left the Senate requires two votes per se\nBecause the only way that states we're going to sign on as if they felt that they had enough insurance against the popular vote that they couldn't afford to sign on to the federal constitution smaller states didn't want their authority withdrawn from them without their permission\nNot on the basis of having a smaller population that's why they're in the United States Senate today Madison argue the only way the federal government to have an appreciation of the people\nWould be terrific administration that if the people shouldn't the future become more partial to the federal than the state government the change would only result from manifest an irresistible proved to the betterment of friction that obviously central he missed the point which is that if the federal government grows and grows and grows and encroaches and approaches and approaches slowly and more slowly\nThan people would just get used to like like a lobster and they just get used to the heat and then he adds that the federal government would seriously take into account state insurance just the state legislature take into account\nCounty interests but he says in the end and this is the point that it really doesn't want you to acknowledge because it ties into Second Amendment rights he said that the states if the federal government got to they've ... the state who would cut it down to size you know that it's quiet to to the people that are pregnant and perhaps refusal to cooperate with the officers of the union\nThe grounds of the executive magistrate mistake embarrassments created by legislative devices which would often be added on such occasions would oppose in any state difficulties not to be despise what form in a large state very serious impediments and where the sentiments several adjoining states happened to be in unison\nWould present obstruction the federal government would hardly be willing to encounter in other words if you start encroaching on ... states will fight back against you and they will stop you from such encroachment he says the only real problem with the federal power for its own take because that would never happen because the state governments with the people on their side would be able to\nRepel the danger so Madison is pretty clear about what the function of state and arms ownership was in ... for a second okay Heather McDonald has a fantastic fantastic these over at the journal\nOr in which she talks about the moving definition of rape it's called the trauma in truth the feminist movement has shifted the definition of rape to include regret and she talked specifically about it very difficult to come to agreement on me too when you woke to\nFind your terms in preparation for the next Salem witch trial like ordeal therefore is working periodically regarding the believes survivors mandate as well and it's corollary the claim that if most self professed rape survivors in our patriarchal culture don't report their assault that because the social and emotional costs are too high\nAnd ... California congressman tablets when an MSA MSNBC last Sunday and here's what happened McDonald's has and this is the correct in two thousand Fifteen they told the Asian of American University conducted a sexual assault survey twenty seven selective college it\nThe vast majority of survey responded to me a you researchers classified as sexual assault victims never reported their alleged assault their colleges rape hotline sexual assault resources centers\nOr title nine office has much lots of campus or said he believes and the overwhelming reason\nHe alleged victims did not report is that they did not think about what happened to them with that Syria at Harvard for example over sixty nine percent of female responded to check the box for penetration by use of force did not report the incident ...\nMost of those ... report sixty five percent did not think that their experience was serious enough to report she said our booze field hook up culture has made relations between men and women messier than ever leaving many girls and women with pangs of regret but those regrets do not equal rate if we were actually in the midst of an epidemic of sexual assault as New Jersey senator Cory Booker is or in the evening with\nA foreign cabinet here and we would presumably and seeing women and girls take protective actions such as a voting frat parties and flocking to single sex schools none of those protective actions has occurred however either women are two coolest white pen danger or the epidemic of sexual assault they fiction all evidence points of latter consideration\nTo get peace but I had to McDonald's and she is in large part correct\nSo so philosophically in and psychologically I Am an intuition is that means I think in tuition is where the action\nIs into it more our moral intuitions come first and they drive our reasoning afterwards that might make it seem as though we therefore can't agree because we're all just driven by gut feelings but it's more complicated than that because our intuitions comes first but they are at your couple they are changeable we can't change each other than tuition just by throwing reason\nYou know last time I talk to each other well you know don't you care about you know respect for your parents or you can't just throw things at each other but in relationships\nWe we come to listen to somebody\nWe can we talk with someone our minds can now this is an amazing ability that humans have that no other animals that we can nailed our minds um if we're open to that and then we can actually hear each other and that's what happened to me when I said I understand conservative thought I actually met a few conservative I mean there were not many in my world I talked to some people and they were\nVery decent people are so\nThrough relationships with the right kind of relationship we actually can open our minds and hearts a great novel can do that a way that's not what if he can do that and one of the tragedies our national life is that while we used to be fairly mixed politically and we were more separated racially and another way\nIt'd be fairly mixed politically and we were more separated racially in another way we've gotten more mix along a lot of access but we're getting more and more separate politically we live more and more and more surefire shelter bubbles and that makes it harder to emphasize it exacerbates our political divide and it damages our democracy\nSo that brings us to the new book the coddling of the American mind which really talks about the ramifications and exactly the sort of divide and any in the column the American mind you talk about what you consider three big problems in American society today if you want to just eliminate those that'd be fantastic\nSure to the book is based around us three great untruth a my first book the happiness hypothesis was actually about ten insights that you find an ancient culture is all over the world psychological insight and so uh one of them is what doesn't kill you makes you stronger\nNeat that was neat just formulation uh but you find the exact same idea in ... in ancient China you find it all over the world that kids need challenges human beings need challenge obstacles failure a step back in order to grow um so that's a basic truth that the psychological true\nBut what we're fighting on campus or finding and the lives of American Kids is an increasing\nThe increasing presence of the idea that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker\nThat is in fact that my father just just recently um it was an article making the rounds ah kids are our mobilizing in high school to ... to to end the practice of regular public speaking\nThat uh we you know some kid had anxiety around public speaking that's very common one of the article one of the lines in Atlantic article quoted a high school kids say nobody should be forced to do something that they're not comfortable doing wow\n[laughter] wow can you imagine raising kids with that did come how would they come out if this is true that we need challenges set back even fear we have to be afraid and overcome it and realize oh I can do that\nAnd if we get into this idea that no one should be forced to do anything they're uncomfortable doing we're setting up the next generation for failure and that's exactly or subtitled how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure\nMore briefly the second grade on truth is always trust your feeling and the third is life is a battle between good people and evil and our contention at the in the book is that if we can successfully teach the young generation all three of these great untruth almost guaranteed to fail\n... let's talk about that that last last way and it seems to me the most dangerous one of all and they tend to favor feelings I think have along subject in history and in some ways may tied into the the intuition isn't that you talked about earlier I mean David Hume suggesting that basically we're creatures of passion\nAnd then the reason for the bride's on top pretending I buy ... with ... with all that said when it comes to the question of young people seeing each other as good and evil do you think that's bringing more from one side of the aisle than than another do you do how do you see that in that chain of causality moving\nWell a little less hold off on the question of who's to blame or who is more guilty of this um let's start with the basic psychology here which is that\nHuman beings evolved for tribalism this is actually a great secret\nOf a Theo chimpanzees hunting they they have ... that they have troops than they controlled territory so they're able to do this and they're able to have battle between groups but humans are the masters of this and while that might sound bad I'm actually is it enables us to cooperate it enables us\nTo have a a a shared moral world so we are by nature tribal and that's what got us into civilization\nBut modern liberal democracies are brilliant at turning back down to allow people to live more peacefully\nHumans go very quickly the tribalism but we can also tone it down were very good at trade were curious about other groups as well and so a good modern society is one that finds ways to turn that down allow people to live near others were different from them with no hostility no violence\nAnd we did a pretty good job of that and the twenty century and there was a huge wave towards democracy we made a lot of progress in the last few centuries overcoming tribalism and the problem\nIs that it's so easy to turn it back on\nAnd a lot of what's happening in our politics between left and right that's been celebrating since the Nineteen nineties crossed partisan hatred keeps going up in the Nineteen eighties or nineties and unfortunately now in certain forms identity politics were finding\nThese these tensions between groups in the United states and I just read it there's a new book out called the tribes something like that in Britain\nVery much the same kinds of things happening in the u._k. but it's very alarming um that our our society our politics social media are turning up our travel is\nSo what what do you think that increased tribalism coming from because my theory would it would be that based on sort of Robert Putnam is believes in in diversity of of ethnicity being less beneficial than for example\nA solidarity with regard to opinion meaning that\nDiversity is is grades along as we all share a common\nGoal but it's like we don't share common goals and everything ... pretty quickly at the the goal oriented nature of the United states a common culture that we shared has basically disintegrated since the Nineteen sixties in some ways has been pretty good on issues of Saxon race for example in some ways and quite bad in terms of traditional morality in my view of the stuff that element social fabric together\nSeems like that's what's been framed most of the social fabric\nAnd what that's done is it's direct people back into the the\nTribalism that that you're talking about what would you attribute tribalism too\nYeah so the way that I think about what's happened to our country um is that\nIn a large secular society there are a lot of forces blowing us apart and there are a lot holding us together and if you go back to the mid to late twentieth century everything was lined up to pull us together\nWe'd had extraordinarily high rates of of um immigration and the elite nineteenth an early twentieth century that's when my grandparents came over from Russia in Poland um\nThe there was a wave of anti immigrant backlash and in the twenties the gates were shot immigration went way down um and as you pay immigration has many good effects and many benefits you you have to look at it honestly and try to maximize the good\nBut we had by the seventies and eighties and very low rates of foreign born um\nThere was the dominant culture it was the wasp culture or David Brooks has written brilliantly about how the last set up a meritocracy within which Jews and Asians and other groups were able to succeed um we had a common enemy still in the Soviet Union um we had a functioning political culture in Washington where there's a lot of bipartisanship oh in the media system um there were three networks\nAnd so there was more a Wally ... I'm In a common sources of news to all those things were lined up and this was the center of American greatness and\nAll over the world people look to America and it hadn't wow\nWe want what they've got let's copy their constitution lets copy their culture um we were the light of the world\nObviously is plenty of anti Americanism to but there's a lot of admiration for us\nAnd then one by one the the centrifugal force is pulling us together began to weaken\nThe media environment obviously were first beginning with cable TV all the way through to social media and now it's a fraction eight in us [noise] um the uh obviously immigration greatly increased beginning of the sixties and again many good things the economist or clear immigration is good economically but as you say\nThe issues of social trust and cohesion Robert Putnam work in others suggest that that that drops trusted others drops and to have a functioning democracy it really helps to have crossed group trust to not be suspicious of each other\nSo in so many ways things are kind of turned around and we have to do some serious thinking\nWhat is it going to take to restore the social support for an effective democracy\nTo restore the the social supports for an effective\nDemocracy my main criticism of the Latin each day is it the left has fallen into a sort of tribalism that we're even acknowledge another try to exist or that there are other there are other people who perceive problems differently so back to your question of the berries alleys and righteous my jet that basically the political lap\nBases itself on a couple of value fairness and harm well it's still going to be deluged based yourself and then by necessity you have to\nBe implying even yourself at the other side is for unfairness and for harm\nBy that in order for that that there cannot be any bridging the gap because he only value that matter are harm perceived as anything bad that happened to anything I disagree with\nResults in a certain number of people getting hurt and fairness in that a person who disagrees with me is in favor of the way institution of patriarchy or a hierarchical and your spotting that evil everywhere you look\nHow can that possibly be bred without help on the left actually acknowledging that there are other values that they come into play and at those ones actually drive people and may not be in fact that you", "show_name": "Questions & Answers", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "13"}
