I'm somebody from the the VA hospital will come out and speak um we also a plan on acknowledging a twenty\nTwenty one servicemen that went off and fought in World War one and who died in service um here we are seeing this year was honoring hometown heroes and with a remembrance for World War one\nNow for those that don't know I'm veterans' day started it was originally called armistice day\nSo when the armistice treaty was signed on the in the eleventh hour on the eleventh day of the eleventh ... in Nineteen Eighteen it ended World War one um and it became known that day became known as armistice day so it was then change to Veterans Day\nUm and so we decided to\nHave a remembrance of though that served in World War one because this year does mark the one hundredth anniversary of the end of World War one and we thought um it'd be a special tribute to those\nUm who many of us you know we have family members sure long ago that that went off and served and\nBig highlight for the city was were acknowledging or in a state law twice he was a profit homegrown hero um went off and\nFlew in France and he was shot down\nAnd he actually died a hundred years ago in September so it's a way of honoring a not only the world war one veterans but all veterans\nUm then there's a lot of people that don't know the difference between Memorial Day and veterans' day right um what we like to say is Memorial Day is is for those\nWho put the uniform on but never took the uniform off because they died while in service or veterans' day is honoring all veterans um who have served so yeah it's going to be a neat little thing\nIt well and then you know it was it was an enjoyable to see her all the history about or in his day love and all that he accomplished in in a short time\nYeah is twenty two years old and the amazing and and I did a presentation for city council weight and for me as a veteran and a history buff it was really neat for me to learn about somebody that I had no idea all I knew was we had an airport named after him um I didn't know he was so distinguished\nRight at it you know and of course we still have the the airfield is named after on his they love
