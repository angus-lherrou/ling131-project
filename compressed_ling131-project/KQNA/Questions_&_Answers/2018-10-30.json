fabulous guy started bringing them up while distance funds show fear to the press get area\nBut before we get 'em started talking about your project the tolerance project lessons from Laramie I Do want to start with its all Hallows eve and so we've been opening the show and talking to our guest and asking you what's your favorite Halloween candy is\nYou know I have to say I go way back to the traditional candy apples rule you know we don't see those anymore no back in the day I I Lived in a very small neighborhood where you know you knew everyone and there was no worries about anything and it was yeah I Love the candy yeah that's the only time of year I ever caught him so\nRight oh I Love them too yeah Mm do you like the Carmel apple or the cinnamon a candy ... I was I was a partial to the Carmel covered and yet ... oh my ... my mouth water just thinking about him with biting into it and that granted full ... okay I got water down what about you on\nThe you got to go with the races in America\nYou know I think if we were taking a job that's going to be\nLike your number one it's so easy to eat on the run you know like I remember when I was a kid and we would be basically shutting everything into those bags and those would be the easiest ones that we could just take out and and eat while we were going\nTrying yeah we met while you're trading [laughter] so you don't take them home and write you know\nWas that parent do or something and they take them I guess what links favorite candy is what I mean she's just going to like you know you're just going to have the gas or hang God your path All right let's let's talk about the tolerance project lessons from Laramie it's a a\nTheatrical production you're putting on November first through the third round you'd okay tell me how\nYou came to produce this\nAnd uh how you came to put this on stage\nWell actually John is officially the producer of the uh the production of which was originally intended to be a staging of the Laramie project through north point academy a truly Harrington one of my cohorts and myself were called in a couple of weeks ago\nWhen uh the director of the original production seem to vanish into thin air or something of that nature\nSo we came on a with two weeks ago and said look I'm I don't think we have enough time to\nActually produce the play itself\nBut what if you got for and what\nThey had was um [noise]\nAll of these students were\nEncouraged to tell their own stories they wrote poems they wrote monologues they did graphic novels so laid out in front of us with all this amazing honest raw material bottom views about discrimination\nAh just heart rending stories on his stories of these kids were willing to tell\nAnd we have coax them into telling it in front of a live audience but\nJust a little bit of the ... the ... the producer with Graham productions I was planning on doing the Laramie project is Twenty years since ... I'm a Nazi shepherds death or\nIn when I go back a little bit about that I mean when you talk about something on the Twenty years ago we have a generation that that's in the window and doesn't even now and that the significance of that like that and how it impacted so many people oh and myself who lives on\nIn a constant reminder of how ugly we can be exactly and yet so let's not do that again it's not go there\nAnd it's always been an aspiration and be able to do that production in Prescott because I see a lot of similarities between um the live and let live type ... uh I'm ... so that that happens in small towns like that um so uh I Want to do the Laramie project and um and of course\nUm so I I wanted to do the Laramie project and um and unfortunately it didn't work out um but uh would speaking with Robert I'm is any uh before we ended up actually doing the um production in the rehearsal and everything like that\nOr he's a teacher over at north point he devoted a whole curriculum I'm of the fall semester to the freshman class about the history of Laramie project why it happened and so on and so forth\nSo or on the twenty sixth of October they were supposed to do a final which was going to be confessional Z\nAnd they were just going to present it for their press night and everything like that will um since we had to drop out of the ah production itself we've taken the twenty sixth the confessional and and basically put it through those are three nights\nUm and and given a chance for the students because we had an obligation with north point and thank God I call Julie Harrington ... an amazing person ends\nUp in arid is is definitely an amazing person to for taking this on in in in um devoting all their time\nTo be able to finish through\nWith north point in the obligations that the last director had basically left behind and he chose to a block all of the production staff and everybody I'm so we'll need to know what was his reasons were\nUm he just ended a blocking I'm blocking us and and blacking out on us and um so ah through that um we have an opportunity for the students to be able to\nReally should let themselves shine and and be able to present their stories [laughter] um so it it is kind of like a monologue or confessional type of deal and the only two people that could have done this would have been um a Julie Harrington in arid uh because basically they took\nNothing [laughter] of of of of of um\nConfessional is I mean it it it ... it there is something there but but turning it into something of an actual show\n... native valid being it and and and I'm figuring out the um basically the ups and downs of the production and and figuring out what pieces were going to be a good right next to each other and everything like that\nOf course we had a scratch some of those pieces but um other pieces would be able to go in and um again uh Craig are often has a let us use that space over at the black box theater over at um a yeah by college uh for for the production itself\nAnd they um have delivered so much of\nA time to be able to change around their schedule so that would be able to have a rehearsing space um that uh we'll we're a racing I'm not getting any profit from this we're basically raising money for the theater\nUm scholarship a four year college and also for the G ... which is a local I'm gay organization that helps out run away teen suicide um and also to die prevention and also I'm trying to uh get those kids that are\nKicked out of their homes because they're gay or it it actually does happen still in Prescott um and and and be able to happen in the ... anywhere exactly and and we we were going to be giving to those organizations I Will be able to come to combat that some\nCounseling or not you're involving well my involvement\nWas basically as a dramatize her which is taking the material\nUh actually I have to be honest I have edited almost nothing I've written a prologue and an epilogue and chosen in order to present the material these are stories that are going to tell your heart out\nAre these are honest kids and these are things to fall on John's line that a commuter need needs to know I mean ... you know that was the story in in Wyoming oh it could never happen here\nWe don't have people like that we don't have kids that are abused we don't have kids that need help what we do and these kids are going to tell you so I think that's one of the reasons it's so important and it's unvarnished and it's\nGive us a call at six thirty second fighting for for more on line

you know senior living and the word key word here is living it's found that out I haven't lately\nWe find a lot of people end up coming to the community kind of maybe having\nA maybe having a negative opinion at first and they get there and they're like I have been more active here than in my entire life and it's just amazing the relationships that they build and the people they meet along the way and the activities that they end up participating in that they would have never done on their own you know it's yeah but I think that relationship\nSometimes people stay too long in their homes that sure you know and hold on to that you know I Need to stay in my home instead of\nMoving out of there and getting to a senior living with her now all new friends activities things to engage them

just such a pleasure and actually\nAnd it's a you know accepted living um and we also have memory care um are British rediscovery program gives residents that are challenged with Alzheimer's and
