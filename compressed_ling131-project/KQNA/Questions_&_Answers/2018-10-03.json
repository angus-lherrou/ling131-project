you've been on many times\nI have it's been a while but I have been on several ... and\nYeah and you're I'm One of our more veteran principles and for us the\nUm scary thought [laughter] I mean this is my ... year\nAs a principle it is eight year how many at Lincoln and how many uh granted\nFor at Lincoln and this is my fourth it granted there you go ... having fun\nYeah absolutely um you've gotten a lot done during that time too\nSo um but we're here today to talk for the whole show about steam we've got all kinds of a great amount students and teachers and we're going to ask you to sit in the whole time with us\nBut mystery so why don't you tell us just let's let's kick this off to our listeners with just a little explanation of what steam is why Granite Mountain has chosen to have such a strong focus on that and and and what that looks like\nSo steam stance or science technology engineering and mathematics and the idea behind it is that students learn their core content material and then utilizing\nScience technology engineering and mathematics they um are able to um be challenged with real world problem solving scenarios and situations and um develop I'm working collaboratively to solve solutions to problems\nI'm using that it's um basically project based learning allowing students to integrate their content learning and apply it in real practical ways\nAnd realistically the future of jobs as unknown and problem solving and the ability to collaborate and communicate with one another absolutely essential skills that our kids need for future success\n[noise] what made you think you know so you know four years ago when you took over granted mountain school and it it was a six seven eight school and it had been restructured to a five six grade school what made you think you know I Want to make this a steam focussed school\nTo soup scoop thanks for tuning in today we're talking with Granite Mountain school math and science teacher Jolie took her and her students\n... and Ryan ... about the steam program at granted mountain school welcome everybody welcome I Know lots of blue shirts and here to their spirit day at a granite good stuff thanks for being here\nYeah thank you for having us well let's start with ... and I'm asked her about you know what are some of the stream project she's been working on this year you know coming up this year your favorite\nAbsolutely Senate this year um some of our projects that we started with is we've been learning about plant and animal cells and we made gigantic versions on posters and kids got to use\nBeads and hike cleaners and all kinds of different things to incorporate the art part esteem into that we've also on an island survival project where they had to travel is a group and they were on a plane and the plane crashed and they were only able to pack ten items\nAnd they had to narrow it down to three to help them survive wow um they've also done on ... farm which is they had to develop their own written language using symbols\nAnd then they um created a clay tablet that they put a message on using that can I ask for\nFor their families to decipher tomorrow night at our steam night ferry nice and then recently we've been working on cigarettes which um they were given some popsicles sticks and wouldn't glue and they had to build a cute story high building that had\nA marble run around it and they wanted to achieve the\nLongest runs so that they there's would go to flow and so they've had to think outside the box a little bit and plan for that\nWe're still working on those and then coming up I Know um there are some plans for making Egyptian boats where they go outside and collect natural items and they make it into the boat to um like way back in the times that connects to their social studies curriculum\nAnd then uh we also have planned where they're going to make prosthetic limbs for animals who may have lost a limb and an injury or were born without one to kind of help those animals have a more successful\nLife wow I bet our readers are thinking I Want to be in your class [laughter] but I again right now\nI don't know if the listeners picked up on that but those all of those are project based learning and part of what that means is there no rights single way to do it so the kids can use our own problem solving skills and creativity to come up with those solutions\nLike an engineer exact foreign investor yeah right and Ryan what uh what's your favorite project been so far would you say\nUm I think my favorite project would be the secret because um it has a lot of different moving parts and you really have to think how are we going to make this this lowest murder run and\nNot run out of sticks wow and so what so what did how did you approach that what is your project look like oh why so far my product um I ... yeah it has a square vase okay with another one on with another\nTop behind them we're going to try to wrap around a run okay just by going stop go stop go in\nA good idea good okay don't let it go fast ... rap and get you back on the show to find out how it worked out right so if a if I was just like your neighbor and I and I said what's the steam stuff you're doing at school run I don't understand how would you explain what steam is\nUm steam is away for everyone to kind of in a way let their imaginations kind of run wild and think of ways to\nUm help people and other things and um\nWell uh yeah well you know not only do I want to be on your class I Want you to be my partner [laughter] I don't I think I'd do well well we\nHaven't heard from Zoe okay All right [laughter]\nSame thing what what has been their favorite so far\nSo far\nHas to be like you know as long as I thought it was really cool how they got to write in clay tablet uh-huh um I got is really find that we've got to make our own language and social say we had to write an actual human F. one has like over six hundred letters cell that was very fun\nSo you I think I heard tomorrow night the parents are going to comic kind of decipher the message on your\nClay tablet how how will they be able to do that\nWe have announced he like that when I learned was moaning and then we also wrote a letter in our alphabet and then they'll have to try and figure out how to decipher the letter a hot\nSo they're going to have to do a little bit of thinking\nAnd I got it Kyrah our teachers\nDo a really amazing job of of tying their project based learning into what they're what they're learning in social studies or science and I'm really having that great application for for their learning in for their project\nThat that makes an engaging that makes it very interesting for sure so he told me about this thing called ... town that I keep hearing about\nWhen you're in fifth grade so that you get to go to this town much as I said before you go to this tiny apply for a job that you want to lie you there okay while you're there you get to do it and then like you get paid certain ... certain money and then you get to go spend to other stores yet stuff that you know\nSo it's like a a mock like real life and business life ... what was your job\nI worked at like a restaurant and I think I was like I think I was like one of the managers All right how to do that\nIf you have to do some math\nThat you have to track them down your income and stuff like that\nYeah there was a bank so like we kind of had to track her income and then the adults in a way\nTracker income and then the adults in LA or break time say like you had to be able to come back on time or\nNot lead to race or something\nOkay All right some job skills in there and I said\nIt's only in Ryan or sixth graders and the biz town curriculum we do in fifth grade so it was way back in [laughter]\nUm they fifth grade done it already said that it doesn't then is that and at the uh nine week unit where it's actually an introduction to economic unit for them so they learn about\nUm basic economy they learn about banking and finances and and um how to earn money and how to run a check register and how to write checks on how to pay bills and and and how to manage a business that's great\nStuff around can you remember your biz don't experience\nUm it was really it was really fun because um it was a way to experience like um when mom and dad comes Jones nights like oh what a great day at work and like kind of get you experience what that's like so\nA fabulous what was your job do you remember I was the c._e._o. of the hospital oh wow wow wow a lot of pressure on the show [laughter] well let's talk now what you know what about Steen do you like like you know ... what do you see the kids get excited about\nI Love watching them and be able to explore
