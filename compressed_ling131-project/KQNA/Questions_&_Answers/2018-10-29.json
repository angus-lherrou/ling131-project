today with heritage part zoological sanctuary with Ron brush here how are you today Ron I'm doing well how are you doing fantastic so what's going on at heritage parks you know nothing much just about four different events coming up with oh wow you guys have a lot going on\nWe try we do have one coming up on Wednesday so two more days it's our annual booth the zoo\nDoo ... that sounds incredible what ... what is it\nIt is a safe place for you to bring kids or even adults that comes to the animals and trick or treat and it's just a nice environment or goes from six to nine o'clock so on costumes are encouraged\nSo it is I'm Halloween nights Halloween Night so it's on Halloween Night and use and it's apathy oh so you can come dressed up bring your children it's a safe place to go trick or treating back now to that\nThere is a little bit of costs was not much it's only four dollars for members and then six dollars for non members so four\nDollars for members so it does pay to be a member of the heritage park to do a logical sanctuary does it I was in a lot of our ... a little bit cheaper a little bit cheaper always works and that it does\nAnd this is such a fun event we get to see how the kids and we're going to have ten different candy stations out there so just going to be fun you get to see the animals and and you know some of the nocturnal animals\nExactly what I was gonna say so some of the things that you've got to see at night are probably like the clouded leopards are things that you don't normally see it during the day 'cause they're hot and they're sleeping [laughter]\nYou name the probably the number one that seems to be the we usually see the cloud of members will come out during the evening and as this dark they just seem to like that a little bit more especially there in the heart of the summer\nSo it'd be a great idea to bring flashlight bring a flashlight absolutely\nWe sell flashlights there as well in case you forget so it should be I guess yeah nowadays it is getting dark pretty early so I definitely would bring it in\n... and then I Know that the zoo has a special anniversary this year as well and you guys are turning the big three zero is that correct yes thirtieth anniversary I'm so excited\nSince Nineteen eighty eight so it's amazing to think that we do here around town you've got to have a zoo in Prescott\nExactly\nAnd so what's going on for the thirtieth anniversary celebration\nWhat's going to be a weekend event so it's going to be on November third and fourth so right after Halloween here and it's going to be in conjunction with our process so November third which is Saturday is mostly going to be\nA balance house in a little bit of games and stuff like that it'll be fun um and then on the fourth we're gonna do a little bit more we're going to go ahead and have at one o'clock a little presentation to some of the people that help build the zoo or keep it going for the last Thirty years and\nThen you are have um animal encounters as well so people can come out and see on the animals and you know with a pumpkin or getting to eat some of the pumpkins and yeah that's a really great\nAnd actually one of the things that we are going to do and actually a blight believe it will be Saturday we're going to do the opening of the sick and the fellow deer enclosures so\nOh that is a big deal though and on the thirtieth anniversary it's kind of a grand opening of a new exhibit exactly so everyone should want to go to the veil and um or their babies\nThere to baby since about June and July so oh how old are you and so they are they to baby deere's yup to baby dared and he said there were a follow and following sicker and sicker here are the ones that had the big stick a deer had the baby not sick they've got\nTheir little why does that had the baby so brand new baby ... they're going on\nThere's a ton and it's pretty neat it the the enclosure they've got to look and really nice and we're looking forward to having people go out there so and actually a big thing about this weekend as well since the thirtieth anniversary members are obviously free but non members are going to get in for only three dollars in honor of the thirtieth anniversary so that'd be\nOh so that's for the thirtieth anniversary celebrations so if you're number it's free if you're a non number it's just going to be three dollars for that day correct and so you guys are opening up but it's completely a whole new path to go around this area right\nYour doctor will help you consider
