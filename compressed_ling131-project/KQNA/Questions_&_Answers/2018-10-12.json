... good to have you on\nAnd hopefully everything goes smoothly like I was trying to say when we first tried to click in wonders ever sees the Arizona Cardinals got a victory\nOn Sunday I don't think they're going to have as much luck on Monday or on this Sunday against Minnesota Vikings and also the Arizona Coyotes not only scored a goal of picked up a victory and we've been chatting about of course it was major league baseball going on tonight at all week and we're going to definitely get into that but\nRumor has it synthetic grass will be heading to chase field to go along with their synthetic manager and synthetic off in ...\nI'm not going to go that far I I still I still love Kay was my case of the GM and with a Tory ... manager but I Would like to see and you know I have discussed this uh\nSome players perform under pressure you know it was a silly the month of September but go ahead oh now that's\nA ... yeah you're what you're looking for and we talk briefly about this uh an hour or so ago is how the team when what eight Nineteen in September and a lot of it seems like the guys did not perform under the playoff race pressure and of course playing much first place teams so your thoughts on that\nYeah exactly I mean when you look at increasing I talked about this about three weeks ago on a point I had him on and\nYou know in his point was that pressure sometimes really makes guys perform better than you would expect to other guys wilt\nUnder the pressure I'm not saying you know I'm not trying to condemn the whole team but it just seemed like we had a lot of guys go away a Stevens who's a junior I really enjoy talking to and everything and\nHe really did nothing I maybe as injuries add something to do with it I think he ended up with three home runs but\nWe just had a lot of guys that that that last month when it really counted they just fell by the wayside and yeah they play some first placed teams but it also allowed us if we could have knocked off the Dodgers in the Rockies or some of these other teams\nSo the Milwaukee Brewers at home or a plus one forty under dog which is about a one and a half to one favorite for the Dodgers I'm sure their favorite for the series too but I look at this series stock and we're going to dig into it\nKind of like the two thousand and one World Series at the Arizona Diamondbacks Arizona Diamondbacks we're kind of laughed at an all the Yankees and you know the mystique and all that kinda stuff like the one thing that\nWe pointed to before that series even started\nWas home field advantage and I would have agreed with in fact we did say if this thing open to New York they might have been over before it started type of thing but the fact that the ... can opener DePaul\nAnd they got the job done they've got those victories at home they might not have been I'll do that on the road but they got it done at home the Milwaukee Brewers just like the art home for this series\nHaving the best record in the national league which was cool I mean they won the team that's one of the eleven straight games Markey brewers including the thrills sweep of the Rockies not a bad team they an impressive victory over the cubs\nAnd even though that wasn't an elimination game\nThey might as well then because the winner of that play off game game one sixty three Milwaukee\nAnd the cubs put the winning team not only in first place but in the driver's seat throughout the whole nationally reached the point I'm getting too they have home field advantage not just in Colorado but now against the Dodgers were the losing team the cubs had to go to the wild card and you know if they've made it through the wild card they would have not had home field advantage\nAnd the Dodgers who did when there's got them their first place but it their record was not good enough to have home field in the national league which might buy them and the bought right now this series that entail see as just like the ...\nVantage damn against those Yankees so would you\nAdvantages them against those Yankees so\nWould you view the brewers I mean how often does it have game on into in Milwaukee with the crowd has been except for when they're playing the cubs are sometimes called fans there that crowd it's been awesome there is a hungry\nFan base indoors even though the weather is terrible but it's indoors might not be heated but it's at least indoors going to be going crazy for game on into also after the three mental games in LA if they have to come back to like the diamond backs had two against the Yankees ... in a one game six and seven\nIs at home and Miller Park so walk you got to get it done they got away at least one I'm not both games and they used to but I give Craig council a little bit of an edge over Dave Roberts I give the Milwaukee Brewers and then bullpen\nAnd some of the guys they picked up the key players in two thousand to Fifteen World Series teams we talked with stock is and Lorenzo chain and the fans are loving both of those guys right let alone the yellow each kid who's been just getting it done if she since the all star break yellowish since the all star break as bad at three sixty seven\nWith twenty five home runs its just since the all star break sixty Seventy RBI and that's in sixty five games to go at the numbers before the season started\nAnd even though this this is first playoff\nHe seems to be performing well he did well against the Braves and I do like Milwaukee to beat the LA Dodgers who I like to call the pool pissed there is 'cause they took a pie in the chase field pool and they want a few years ago and clenched and you know it's not a day Roberts team though I like day but\nI liked the brewers I'm going Craig council and I know there's a let me throw this in ... you may already out those things that you know I'm almost done I'm All right I Know there's Dodger fans all over Arizona and even in Prescott because there's so many Californians that have moved\nTo the valley and to press get press is loaded with California folks\nAnd I love them but if you're a diamond backs fan you're really not a Dodger fan it's kind of like if you're a giant San Francisco giants fan you're not really a Dodger fan now you can be a Dodger fan 'cause you've been a Dodger fan forever and all that kind of stuff I guess but if you've been in Arizona for a few years and attended the games\nAnd seen some of the fans and and all that it's really easy to root for those brewers in our old buddy Craig counsel so with that said and I'm like they're going to a few more things your thoughts on the brewers on the Dodgers of course they got many Machado and all the homerun hitters and they hit a lot of home runs last year's but dock\nTheir batting averages are terrible they they were they were usually out hit they had more runs in kids but they were getting them they were getting home runs in that series I think they hit a home runs in N O D s and after setting a franchise record in LA eating two hundred and thirty five during the regular season so\nIf you can keep them away from the long ball or walking guy he's given a solo homerun like forgive Jenkins used to do like Curt Schilling used to do solo home runs that going to kill you but don't let them get a babysitter a walk or two and then a three run Homer type of thing\nSo I still I liked the brewers not going to be easy like home field advantage and again some of your thoughts go ahead and rent a little bit go ahead and tell listeners what you think about the brewers and the Dodgers because these are two teams we know very well\nAmerican League not as well but we're we talk about them and their games tomorrow but the big game tonight your thoughts on the ... crew\nAnd your LA Dodgers one of the Dodgers\nHave hit this year more home runs than any Dodgers team in history in at seven players\nOn the roster with twenty or more home runs so you're right that's what they rely on and that's how they went a lot of games I think there was one of the games all the play offs to her that you know less him that's what they have like three or four all runs and they ended up winning the game so that's kind of they were calling card and\nPicking up it's nice to have deep ... Machado of Brian do measure and that David freezes help them a little bit too and he's actually going to be starting\nFor them tonight but going back to your home field advantage it's it's really interesting in a seven game series if you were the road team and you win game one\nYou have a fifty nine point seven percent chance to win the series so it's important for walkie to do like the diamond backs didn't in the whole the whole field advantage because Dodgers when to tonight they flipped it then they\nHave home field advantage so we have to kind of keep our eyes on that a lot of people were rolling their eyes to like a credit counseling I Love him to he's a smart guy\nAnd he said before the series you know he's going to approach it a little bit differently because his bullpen is so fantastic\nBut in many ways uh he's got geo Gonzales starting and uh he had three post season starts the it was like a six point six he or re um and he has a pitch that since September but\nIn his last five regular season starts he was three in with a to point one three he RA so you saw is no stranger and he might be a little ... and I think\nThat he's going to have a short leash I'm encouraged council will be asked to he can go to the bullpen\nA pretty pretty quickly and and in fact this this is blows my mind to the three game series with Colorado\nBrewer starters got twenty nine outs in three games the bullpen got fifty five out by six different members of the bullpen so that just goes to show you how that team is set up it's kinda like Kansas City was a few years ago\nA few years ago when they won the world series so that's something to keep their eye your eyes onto he matchup and fun to watch tonight is it'd be Clinton crucial versus Christian ... the young kid you talked about who I think he's you know hands down going to be the MVP of this year\nAnd against ... he's nine for Seventeen so the kids hit 'em over five hundred against ... Shaw and a five twenty nine batting averages as a matter of fact and he's a left handed hitter and courage on the left handed\nPitcher so that's that's pretty interesting and this season which is for for six off ... Shaw and he has to home runs as well so that'll be fun to watch it was brought up the courage shouted a yesterday I guess it was and he was saying well\nHe's going to try to him that you know the the whole that yellow ... over him so\nHe's the number two hitter in the lineup for the Dodgers the number two hitter as Justin Turner he of the red beard and of course he's kind of like ... the numbers this year but he is there\nA ... start if he gets on base and starts doing things for the number to all that a lot of things can can happen for them\nUm let's see if I've got anything else on the the brewers bullpen ... since September first\nThirty or a is one point eight nine so they have really been coming on and then uh I like Craig counsel for a couple of reasons and those couple of reasons are he already has two World Series rings as a player\nHe's from Milwaukee a and you know he could be taken them to their first world series\nFor the brewers since Nineteen eighty two and I think they were on the American league than the last to St Louis so I'm kind of pulling for ... council too I Love to see the brewers go up there\nPulling for ... council too I Love to see the brewers go up there and do and they have a very capable line up they can hit the long ball well to they can screen gets together but what I think is really interesting as the dominance of the bullpen so I think council he's in the ... starters out there if he gets\nProblems on for three or four innings I think he's on the go up and start ... guys then because uh he doesn't just have two or three that he can rely on he's got at least six guys and Josh hater their young left handed pitcher that kid is really something else\nCrate counsel it's do or die time he's going to play everybody and anybody fall Barrow relief pitchers you name it late Molly you might not see the third inning even geo ... dollars might not even if they're pitching good which weighed Miley did the other day you get a shot outgoing and he took a monitor foreign to third\nSo great gain interesting game will keep your press on that you've got ... got the day off and Billy pushing those buttons and hopefully they'll\nAll be pushed whale the rest of the way voter play a couple of quick commercials we come back we're going to talk about the American league series we're talking about those Arizona Cardinals picking up a victory the coyotes pick up a victory and even though\nIt was only there first victory out of three games they've actually out shot the opposition every game so with that win last night or I guess was like a Wednesday night against the Anaheim Ducks in Anaheim\nIt gives me a little faith because in a shootout though in a shootout yeah but they finally scored and they you know and in the hour shot Anaheim again in all three games\nOut shot their opposition by a pretty good margin and that's something that we used to complain about the you know shoot the park should the particle they're shooting the park\nIt's just they run into some hockey goalie there it's possible that could be three in All right now but they're wanting to we'll talk about those guys and let you know about the next game coming up on Saturday but lots of go over and you want to talk to an extent there around the corner to we got some uh college football or talk about\nAnd are actually you of Asian action tonight I Want to stay tonight I Want to give you the information on that and get doc slow down and if you're playing ... tough place to play in Utah so we'll get docked in part on that so lots more coming up right after this\nCame from here and ... are you interested in buying a home and just have a million questions running through your head and the change team at Wal Kimball mortgage is here twenty four hours a day seven days a week by appointment even if you need to meet on Saturday morning because you weren't scheduled\nMovie they're called the chains Rausch team that for four or five eight seven three zero Wallach ... mortgage or when you make and I was in each of them are going\nTo live on the phone with us\nBy my model the shells and was this was his own mind going\nBy the time when you\n\nCan save cash in cash three little words music save gas in\nYour own income you bring your own your own home and you get rid of your own one even new houses to seven days a week Flagstaff valley more online\nMusic the dot com that's the letter Z dot com\nYou'll northern Arizona sons are back in the court on November ... when the seasons ...

coming up at five oh ...\nAnd the brewers and now that we're totally done with them their games coming up at five o nine we're gonna let you know\nIf and when there's a score how things are going with that one tomorrow night there is a another baseball game and this is the Boston Red Sox have a home game against the Houston Astros and this is the American league championship series of going for the ... you gotta like Justin in Berlin or on the mound\nChris Sale he was awesome he's he did okay last time out you know tall thin guy twelve and for this year but this velocity has been down and it can't effect that started off well\nIn the game that he pitch for Boston but it drops drop drop they find took him on the fifth any so I'm a little bit worried about Chris Sale\nA starting for the red Sox I Love Justin ... he's really proven to do well especially last year ... shows even though they have a worst record than Boston they only won a hundred and three games boss and of course won a hundred and eight\nCrazy numbers there but the Astros were in the world series last year still fantastic team Boston it's got the off and you got a little that pitching though with VR lander Jerry Cole or some of the other guys for the Astros\nAre your thoughts about Saturday's game in the series between the Boston Red Sox stock at home the home field advantage against Houston Astros into miles Saturday's game also be five or nine first pitch but not today the Milwaukee LA's today but tomorrow night would be that game then they've got the Sunday game with Garrett call against David Price\nOr the kind of it's a little questionable in the playoffs so I'm a little bit of wandering about those starting pitchers for the red Sox now when you put sixteen runs up like they did against the Yankees beat him sixteen one the other day you know you and I could probably ... to win but what's your thought about these two\nTremendous teams a hundred and eight wins for the red Sox a hundred and three for the Astros what a match up going at it for the American league championship games\nWell because of people will probably go what Red Sox won more games I think the astro is right now or just a powerhouse teams they have every phase of the game covered\nIn Boston you have to worry a little bit about their bullpen for instance and what have you but you look at the starting pitcher pitching you've got Justin ... you just mentioned to who is also the future hall of famer of\nBoth for Mary and came up to him for his baseball career you you got to give that guy is five star of rating and then follow him up with Derrick Cole\nWho when he pitched here he was on a flight you know I mean I think I was amazed African armies strike outs yeah but he just\nHandcuffed the diamond backs so like crazy so he you know he he's a very very good pitcher all hard thrower I Believe that got him from the pirates way back a couple of years ago anyway I think one Fifteen games this year or two point eight ER a\nAnd then they you know they can just keep pouring guys in Charlie Morton Downey although to cut yeah ... ... his last name\nSo that's pretty darn good then people don't realize is the Astros they let the American league in he or re this year\nSo their bullpen is coming in with the best DRA in the home of American League and their clothes are all Roberto ... is a pretty darn good player to you know two point three Seventy or a\nA twenty some say is I Believe it was I Can't remember exactly what he had and then when you look at their line up it's crazy they they have some injuries this year which is maybe why they didn't uh wouldn't quite as many and uh they had a hold off Oakland there for a while but\nGeorge Springer Kaiser really go to Alex Bergman who's the diamond backs passed on he mentioned that when the Astros played here he's still at a grudge\nAgainst the diamond backs 'cause he couldn't believe they pass them over it and he's kind of a short guy he's an illness you guys so you don't like that from the the SCC and he's just been going bananas and you know I'm ... and then of course Carlos Korea shortstop\nPray you of you know that's a second base I mean ... years away on online and it was like oh my goodness so I'm going to go with the Astros and\nUm they might want to play in five I just think they're that powerful and uh I wouldn't mind seeing JD Martinez too well and and see the the Red Sox really put up a bitter battle but\nYou'd probably I'll disagree with me on this program I was betting I Would just go at the house was I just think their team\nHas every facet of baseball covered and covered well\nWell and winning it in game five five games makes sense because in Houston will be coming home for that fifth game and\nNot wanting to go back to Boston for game six and seven the one negative thing on Houston would be the fact that the red Sox do have home field advantage\nIn this in Fenway Park which is generally a really good place to play for the red Sox Houston has you know I think they each one the most games at home\nThis year well then makes sense because each one of the most games and all of baseball get a hundred and eight wins for Boston harder three for ... make a good point use thing would have won more games except for they were injured had more injuries that the red Sox did", "show_name": "Questions &
