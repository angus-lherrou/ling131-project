Shapiro show every week or on the program for your educational education we go through a federal papers you know what the founders were thinking let's get into where all the way up to a federal forty seven written by ... by James Madison and this one is really fascinating because they talk about the original concept the liberation of powers\nMedicine has the charity is a failure on the oppression of powers he says quote\nThe accumulation of all powers legislative executive in judiciary and the same hand when there are one of your money and whether hereditary self appointed Earl I may jump we pronounce the very definition of charity in other words if you have a branch that had ... helped me to help our executive power and legislative power that would be a tyranny\nThey said that if the constitution were really charge but what the humiliation of that sort of power\nWe're really charge about what the humiliation of that sort of power that no further arguments will be necessary to inspire a universal representation of the system you don't say listen they're part when he decorative Doug legislative south in Hartford legislative an executive stuff inclined toward the judiciary does legislative stuff but\nIrrigate extended an exclusive power one of the other branches that attorney because Martha ... who is the progenitor of this idea of check and balance in his meaning as his own words import and snow or conclusively as illustrated by the example in it I can imagine you know more than that\nThat were the whole POWER UP one department is exercise by the same hand which for the whole power of another department the fundamental principles in a free constitution arson murder this would have been the case in the constitution it down and by him if the king was the sole executive magistrate and also things that may complete legislative power or Japan administration got this\nMonth askew objected to the murder I mean that given the legislative to here is a quote from month to skip when the legislative and executive powers are United in the same person or body that can be no liberty because the apprehension may arise let the same on our Senate\nAnd an act radical ought to execute them in a tyrannical manner is and one of the power of judging joined with the legislative life liberty and the subject would it be exposed to arbitrary control\nFor the judge would then be the legislator or join the executive power the judge might behave with all the violence of and oppressor\nSo the argument right now in the United states is whether this is what actually happened with the executive branch the negative branch basically legislation not basically they do the regulatory power the executive branch in legislative power now you can argue that's not the whole legislative power in Congress confirm that\nCongress has failed attempt at and you actually would like to see check and balance again Congress has to take back some of that our parents is doing some of that under President Trump they were involved in in a legislative move where they basically were knocking down regulations that are pretty rapid rate\nThat good unnecessary executive power has also gain the judiciary power given management of agencies but their own hearing board which is one of the reasons why there's been a lot of focus on a case called Chevron Chevron is a Supreme Court case in which the Supreme Court that\nThe judiciary has to grant administrative deference to administrative agency so you have a case in front of the EPA go to the EPA board the ministry to board and gives you a judicial decision the question is when the judiciary confirm that petition ... you know\nThat's why she ever on his wrong and so I jumped in Gorsuch and oppose Siobhan\nIt's why the cabin off Chevron ... truck down\nJobs for these checks and balances to mirror store irrigation of too much power in one branch is the essence of tyranny that remains true today as one of the constitution was written show if you feel like everybody is taking cranky pill that because they are so I'm about to play for the worst add in political history\nThis thing is hot garbage miss is an ad that is currently making its way across the up and waves in Arkansas and it's targeted at black voters the editor on behalf of congressman French ill\nFrom that kind of an unnamed group it so bad it's great

to do with that ad salads stopped there were some pretty spectacular ads in this last election campaign out and we have and we had the guy was doing cocaine ... which was just amazing that top cocaine which I think that in a better than cocaine ... coming up audio from our Sunday special with charcoal\nSo much for your leadership do you think is natural to you because you're talking about I won't lend hearing is out of the guys tremendous initiative from a very young age maintain even before the place where nobody goes in the military and he's joined the military takes a lot of it is and I fell today at ... ... do you think it really is the leadership and his lawyers had Brad\nYeah I did ask his question all the time and so it's both it absolutely both ... and you as a human being are going to get certain characteristics\nThat are gonna make you a good leader and you're going to lack some characteristics that would make you a good leader if you add them you don't get tens across the board you know it's like a little video games you see kids play where you get a a nine and strength Senate at a at seven in ... in a and an eight and dexterity and you get to as a leader\nAnd you don't get all towns so some leadership\nCharacteristics that make a good leader for instance I'll be there to be articulate if you can express your message clearly to people that kind of that could help you from a leadership perspective if you have some natural charisma that's going to help you from a leadership back if you can look at complex problems and you can simplify them that's gonna be helpful as the leader\nBecause that's what you're doing so they can't persuade there's all kinds of things that will help me as a leader and you're not going to be good at all and so\nAs a leader if you look at the ones that you we got you can and\nHave the leader if you look at the ones that you we got you can improve 'em ups that's what's beneficial so you can't take someone that's just a horrible leader and make them into an amazingly or you can\nTake them out to a deacon leader and you can make them into a very good or even an exceptional leader because how you know you can definitely get more articulate you can definitely get more comfortable speaking to people you can definitely get more more\nPrecise at taking very complex problems and simple find them so that your team can understand what it is an easy to get done\nAnd these are all things that you can improve upon and I always have to close this out by saying that there are some people that cannot become better leaders and the people that cannot become better leaders are the people that can't put their ego in check that they lack humility\nAnd those people they think they're doing everything great so they're not going to improve its leaders you can't go Jim you can't convince them they think they're perfect then they're going to stay where they are from a leadership perspective\nSo what what are you actually learn from the first time you went through seal training and he joined the military and you decide to go to the hardest let everybody widely across America no training program America what is that like\nThe the miss about seal training\nOr to seal training is that you learn anything at all [laughter] 'cause you actually you know it's it's I mean you can you learn some things but it's a screening process what they're trying to do is get rid of people that don't want to really really\nReally do that job so it's it's suffering you're going to be doing you're gonna be way you're gonna be called you're gonna be tired I'm going to be that for extended periods of time and there's an eighty percent of church and right\nBut when you make it through you you you get to SEAL Team and when you get through to ... that's when you start to actually learn about being a seal that's when you learn the\nBasics and leadership perspective that's when that's when you start to become an actual\nField getting through the basic seal training it you know when you show up at a SEAL Team\nEveryone looks at you you you you come out of their thinking you like you just said oh I just went through the toughest training in the world you can do is they will pay I literally checked in with a master chief and he said everyone here has been through that training no one cares [laughter] show humbling when you show up and that's when you start to learn you start to learn when you get into ...\nAnd when it comes to you know getting to know how do you determine leadership position even among people who you're initially equals with ... and then you think that sort of naturally falls out\nOr there's a structure inside the military doesn't rank structure inside the single teams and and you're going to be\nAware of you for you when you're a new guy you're gonna be the junior guy and then the next time you're going to be a little bit more saying you have a couple of guys working for you to the tune she is going to be you know the senior guy enlisted guy in inside of a single parent and then you'll have an officer in charge of the whole thing and those are pre designated\nAs a pre designated which was very counter to my initial thought when when I joined the navy my dad told me I wasn't gonna hate it because I said why do you think of and have egos 'cause you don't like to listen to anybody and don't like authority\nAnd of course I told him no doubt it's just it's a team\nWe don't have to when I was listening anybody's a team and I was completely wrong because there is a rank structure and you absolutely you know there's a ... it's the military even though it's a team and you definitely have you built relationships throughout that chain of command and that is more prominent than in some other groups but you still there the chain of command and you're gonna you're gonna fall that chain of command\nAnd then there's a lot of talk about then ... mandatory national service in so many has gone through this program and that has seen so many guys who are military I come from I knew you know back when they were in high school and we're kind of you know I I Can't in order to ever they were kind of messed up and and then they come out the other end and they're you know\n... and not only odds and ends the really making some then says what do you think of the idea that mandatory national service\nI Love the idea of it but at the same time as an American I don't like the idea of mandating that people knew something that they don't want to do and I and I think the volunteer military that we have right now is\nIt it might be the best in the history of world we have a great military and\nI think to mandate it I think it's problematic that being said every single person that I talked to especially kids that are the age of you know Thirteen fourteen Fifteen you get the opportunity to join the military than I Would definitely recommend it because like you said it it it teaches you a lot of things\nWhen it comes to you know the application of leadership principles how much of what you learn and leadership training at the seals was applicable and how much of it was just an education and now you've gotta you gotta move you gotta figure something out and how much I mean you see your pants kind of stuff\nWell when I came in we really didn't and it's a shocking we really didn't have a a a process of leadership training that the leaders went there and we would basically the leaders would learn\nOJT on the job training you'd watch the person that would lead to you and then what is your time to take over you kind of emulate what they were doing and if you had a great leader that worked okay\nIf you had a bad leader that was a real problem and so when I came back from that deployment to Ramadi that's one of the things I focused on that I realized that we really needed to implement leadership training for the guys because you're on the battlefield leadership in the most important thing on the battlefield and if you don't know what you're doing you're going to get people killed without question\nAnd we'll all that sort of they can you give me a couple of stories sort of demonstrate that point and what's what's the high points of leadership that you've seen on the battlefield as opposed to low point evening in terms of leadership\nFor one thing that's important to clarify here is when I talk about leadership not just talking about me because I was in charge of the task unit or the income attitude in charge of doing or even the people above me I'm Talking about every level of leadership every person taking ownership either a piece of the mission and executing\nExecuting with a forty and executing with with real like passion about what they're doing and so you've got to have leadership at every level and when you don't have that it it's very problematic so what was great for me when I came back and I took over the training\nFor the west coast okay I got to see we we put on the most realistic combat training extremely stressful\nVery realistic and I would get to see a platoon goes through the training and then the next night it'd be another platoon going through the same scenario and then that could be another book and going through the same scenario I got it was it was basically the most incredible leadership laboratory\nIt might be the most incredible leadership laboratory that's ever existed it was awesome to be able to to be able to put these\nThese ... these Internet training and that was where it became very clear that leadership if you're in a good leader and is able to\n... to do a good job and by the way that leader didn't need to be the senior guy he could have been a guy that was two or three wrong down but when things started happening you step up and and take command and make things happen I mean as long as the other leaders maybe that will senior them\nHad the wherewithal to say you know what this guy seems to have a grip on the situation I'm gonna let 'em roam with it then it would be OK\nOccasionally you get an egotistical leader that would be like oh you're stepping on my toes and they try and put them down and and that will be problematic but you'd see a good solid leader anywhere and that and see what will soon would make those tunes perform great and if you had a bad leader in the field soon\nYou'd watch the whole will soon followed power apart if no one step up\nAnd took charge and made things happen as soon as very evident and that's another thing that just solidified the principle that we the same the same principle that we teach the businesses are are literally the exact same principle that we wrote about extreme ownership of the same principle that we talk to the young single leaders coming up\nOkay so now jak let's get down to some of the main lessons in leadership so what's the number one thing you look for in a leader\nWell the first book was called extreme ownership and what that means is you're not going to make any too says you're not going to blame anyone else you're going to take ownership\nOf whatever happens and when something goes wrong instead of pointing fingers and blaming someone else take ownership of that problem you're gonna take ownership of all the solution to that problem is you're going to take ownership of implementing that solution so that is the number one thing that I'm looking for for\nThe ocean so that is the number one thing that I'm looking for for a leader to do is take ownership of the problems and again we call that extreme ownership and it was one of the thing that was very easy to see it as the ... because when someone doesn't take ownership and starts Oregon fingers and blaming well it like for instance right now if I started when my finger and blaming you for something which are natural\nReaction go to the fence to get up and said I mean it's not my fault is broadcast what I wanted to make a guy who got great\nAnd then what happens is we have a team where you're going on with your finger you your point a finger someone else and now we have no one taking ownership of problems\nAnd therefore the problem with never gets all the opposite of that is when you have a good leader to step up and says hey Ben your weapons broadcasting do the way I wanted to I should have done a better job preparing to for your questions I'm Sorry I Apologize and now instead of you getting the fact that you say you know what no actually I could have done a better job and now both for taking ownership of the problems and we're going to get resolved so that's\nKind of a number one characteristic of someone that has the humility\nOr the earth when something goes wrong and you're a leader and you say oh you know what all this was a bad situation it's my fault I'll take ownership of it you have to be home all in order to do that", "year": "2018",
