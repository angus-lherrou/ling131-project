change for a while but I'm Glad to have you back in business solutions how you doing stand up and just talk to me 'cause I Love your accent [laughter] I'm fabulous round formula affirmative just did it just melts you guys out there [laughter]\nLet's talk about your business and\nSo yeah we're whereas you know we're we're start up right we've been in it or for the last two years a variety of our to acknowledge disciplines actually IT project management IT infrastructure management and monitoring the list goes on your IT assessments\nUh I Do security an auditing and one of the things we're excited a boat or over the last ... a year or so is you know the order to section of of what we do or do you order teen services of what we do\nAnd what that is is really we go in too small to mid sized businesses and help them understand\nHold her using technology in their organization are they using it in the right way um you know one of the things she phoned is most people go out and they'll just buy the latest and greatest thing and you realize well this is not really working for us right and they have that kind of\nTechnology anxiety it's what we do is we sit with them or not and and go through what is your business do ... and then hold us technology support that business and are you using the right technology and if you're not willing to hold you would get you there\nAnd and so we do that through a process of education would you'd have to a process of just our own expertise because we know your industry which is okay here here's what's right for you\nKnow the technology audits has been you know something exciting for us that we'd been willing to we've done some for you know local businesses here are a few oath in Florida and it's just been an exciting time\nWhen you refer to technology what do you mean by that I mean that's a that's a big brown law in the end of the car is probably a lot of areas so when you're talking about a technology what are you are you going to computers are you looking at my software and\nThat's that's not you know I I I'm Glad you asked that question because it really is anything\nThat is electronic so yes it is your computers it is a software that ruins on computers but it also is your money fracturing equipment if you're running a ... and you have you know on a widgets and about doing things for you\nAnd it's supposed to be connected well hoarded connected you know how is that data coming back into your house then coming back into management\nTo give you write information to make critical decisions\nAnd to give you write information to make critical decisions so in terms of technology we look at the entire uh Reykjavik everything knowledge inside your building from the phones right to the most on your desk\nOkay well I was kind of listening to you putting in and the prospect of how it relates to my business the chamber of commerce and of course it was all about me and I was trying to think what else do I you know but you're right the phones are all all of that that is I'm involved in operation because so much of it we do everything in ... technology anymore\nYeah I mean that other than my one on one personal conversations with people coming into the office but so much of everything else is messaging letters the whole the whole nine yards\nWe're we're we're all connected and that's really what it is yes oh\nOkay so in it so in a way it's good for a business to have this on it not only make sure they're using the right technology but if they need upgrades that they're losing let's say I'm", "year":
