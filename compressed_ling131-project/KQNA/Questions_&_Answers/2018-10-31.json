looking for one of the macro bears that kept over the brewing industry after prohibition but while those fears are still produced in America that companies that produce them I no longer America down we offer you a variety of premium domestic tears\nThrough right here in Prescott, Arizona\nHow much more domestically and they can you get made in America and America you know really in companies real the real food real people and real logo\nYou're listening to talk of the town on cake you in a once again here's your host Sherry I welcome back\nEveryone you're listening to talk of the town and cake you in a in well we have a very special guests in the house right now I I'm not even sure how we can introduce\nOther from tough but fair for\nOne year representing Arizona's home town radio group which is where we're\nSitting well and uh just uh having returned from forty five days where uh I I can tell you there's no greater owner was going to be able to sit with you guys and do a ... chamber show we love having your show\nAre the Prescott chamber\nShow love having an already fighting so\nWe want to hear about this trip there now that the great things that went on there\nWell you know when you are when you're planning a trip like this um you go in with you know very moderate expectations you're just there to uh you know we we have family and we went to Israel um this is our sixth trip to ah to Israel\nA and this time we had um a much more important mission to accomplish and that is to a witness bear witness to uh the arrival of our first grandchild oh so that was mission accomplished\nShe had shot\nA her due date was supposed to be like a couple of days after we got there yeah this baby wanting to come out sooner so uh she was actually born or on the Eighteenth of September\nAnd we got there on the twentieth so Mr by that much but like somebody else a someone along the way told a civil all the hard work will be done all the all the you know all the mess will be\nNot just for them to get in on that and found that worked out nice well congratulations to you and carry and I that's a special special time them well enough\nSo that was uh you you figure it's all downhill from there right on the trip with the birth of your first grandchild yeah\nWell you know things kind of fell into place and I'm a while we were there we received a an email\nPress release from the general assembly which is a a a of a thing that's done by the Jewish Federation of America every year as normally done here in the states well this year it's in Tel Aviv\nAnd happens to coincide with are being there wow uh and so you know we said All right well normally we're like well maybe maybe maybe now but then it said that featuring\nA speech by prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu now live and in person and we're thinking what else a chance to see Netanyahu a person weren't going to give it a a good good solid try\nSo we uh emailed the press contact in New York for press passes and buy gum we got granted press passes\nAnd so we got to go to the assembly we've got the network and everything and then uh the big features on Wednesday and so one thing we learned about Israelis is that they don't have a real good sense of time and logistics okay just kind of like throw everything\nThey get to ... so yeah so one time should\nWe be there and they said well you should definitely be there by nine thirty the speeches at eleven there's got to be enhanced security and you want to make sure you get there and plenty of time so we said ... we're going to get there about a quarter to nine\nFeet you know how large was this assembly\nUm it was only about fourteen hundred people wow these are delegates from all over the u._s. and they all flew to ah Tel Aviv\nTo participate in three days of seminars and and so forth so this was like their big send off the last event of this three day thing was Benjamin then young so anyway\nSo we go if we go through the security breeze I mean there was nobody there\nYou know 'cause we got there forty five minutes early there you go into we walk up and as we're getting ready to go through the podium where the security is the guy says sorry we have to stop you right here\nAnd it's like okay let's give a shout out of it that way for whatever reason it's like\nThere's something going on security wise and so they let everybody else in up to us and then the line started forming behind us\nSo we were probably standing there at the podium I'd say about twenty minutes okay and they're thinking about another thing about Israelis are very impatient the woman behind me is trying to talk the guy at the security push to let her and\nHow much longer is this going to take\nYour country just let me and I you know I'm young I'm I'm you know I've got to be I'm going to be fine now you're young you can look at my bag and you\nAnd so eventually they let us then and there was like a VIP section at the very front of the hall that was marked by a blue rope\nSo we were in the second row behind the blue rope wow and we're surrounded by the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles they were had like every seat in both of the first two rows but Terry and I planted ourselves dead center\nIn roe number two behind the blue court and we got to watch bedroom and that will give a very\nEmotional a very uh evocative speech or about what it's like to be an Israeli in ah in today's world and\nYou know I always found him to be a very honest and forthright speaker and so to be able to witness some first hand was just it was ... it was just really well and I had to take a picture a selfie backwards any with Netanyahu in the background so people wouldn't think that was the thing about\nIt [laughter] no one would ever think that there aren't that many\nBut I that's that's a great to hear kids now you can bring this back to all I Know that and when you've traveled before and come back and do a lot of teachers and and talk about the experience there\nWell and and this was um you know the amount of uh the the variants of the people that were there and attendance a all over the political spectrum there was a they were encouraging a lot of dialogue between people with different points of views and so it was a very you know\nI'd say a emotional\nOr experience not just seeing that and you know but then the people that you're meeting and they're meeting you where you're from Arizona\nAnd you know hey you know and so the the it was really cool that was just very cool and um but uh it wasn't the only highlight of the trip we actually got to rub elbows\nWith some people from Prescott in Tel Aviv that was really\nIt was just saying that\nThe um uh as as you guys know a lot of people have heard the Arizona\nAh Israel technology alliance has been doing a lot of work up here uh with Embry riddle and so forth and a labor ... who's in charge of this put together this tour a of Tel Aviv ah focusing on high tech and cyber security\nAnd there are a couple of people from a college Rodney Jenkins and Ron list that went on the trip\nAnd so sure enough you know they're having this you know a cocktail party at one of the contractors the Israeli aviation contractors and Terry and I can walk again and I mean you could have knocked\nOver whether the federal workers you got a fellow man for an hour that they understand very well\nA fellow board member now relies on the chamber of Lincoln as\nSoon as earlier and labor you know because you know we're kind of the insider outsiders 'cause we're not on the tour right you know we're like the who are these people what did they lay loosing everybody in the room was it and finally we have to uh give a big shout out to\nA sample of Jericho on on the arrival of their first grandbaby\nAbout how after they were\nNetworking and everybody in the room is coming up to American graduated it goes out of the grandbaby or give us an excuse to to talk to them and um but no there was it was a\nIt was just a really great a trip um had a chance to tour a winery that uh at the end of the tourists to find a way you should come back at seven o'clock tonight we're having our tenth anniversary party\n[laughter] L. O. J. I guess we're going to do the right place at the right behind the whole trip and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Questions & Answers", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "31"}
