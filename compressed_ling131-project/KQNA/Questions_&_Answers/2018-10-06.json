Shapiro shows no Republicans did in fact vote for cloture on Brett Kavanaugh and the vote is to take place on Saturday So thank you once again Harry Reid let me just began with a bag thank you to Senator Harry Reid who killed the filibuster on judicial nominees way back in twenty Thirteen\nAnd Mitch McConnell cocaine Mitch in his passion turtle lake Ashton said at the time you will come to regret this sooner than you think an opioid Democrats regret it right now because all it takes us fifty one of those not sixty votes in order to elevate someone to the Supreme Court\nMe vote on Brett Kavanaugh was closer than expected and that is because of the\nPolitically traders behavior or Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted no on closure Joe Manchin of West Virginia who wishes to retain his seat in the Senate\nVoted yet that means that it is now a bipartisan opposition because one vote bipartisan opposition to cabinet and also a bipartisan support for Kavanaugh because on one vote basically one man one Democrat voted yes\nOne of the public and voted no on closure\nBut this thing is too close for comfort wouldn't it be nice right about now at the Alabama GOP had not nominated and Roy Moore to fill the Senate they give me a little bit more breathing room I think I'd feel a little bit happier about life right now suffice it to say the odds are very much\nOn Brett Kavanaugh side in terms of being confirmed Jeff Flake voted yes on cloture Susan Collins voted yes on culture in order for cabinet to go down right now basically both those people have to switch their vote or Joe Manchin switches vote\nBetween culture and the final vote the final vote is designed to take place on Saturday that the that is the goal it's supposed to take place tomorrow\nAnd we don't work out the obviously is in the crosshairs because Lisa Murkowski who lost her primary and twenty sixty and then won a write in votes\nAnd what about forty four percent of the vote in her election before that in twenty ten against the libertarian candidate should not wildly popular in Alaska or anything like that but she feels pretty secure because she's not up for reelection until twenty twenty two and now she got to burnish her feminine bona fide he\nWould not be particularly surprising if the Democrats at some point went back to try to stay in twenty twenty it would not be particularly surprising to see somebody like Lisa Murkowski switch to independent Allah Jim Jeffords and then caucus with the Democrats in order to preserve her seat that would not be a giant shots Murkowski bows the wrong way on that\nSusan Collins votes the right way unquote her she has in the past voted for cloture on particular measures and then voted against the nominee if she were to do that\nIf you were to vote in favor of culture and then vote against the actual measure being taken then you would see a fifty fifty tie in the Senate broken by vice president which is about ... minutes margin that you could put somebody on the court by but hey\nAlmost only counted horses and hand grenades and it's an either so as long as he gets confirmed\nThat's all that matters in the end Joe mansion of course has a lot of pressure on him but he also understand that if he votes against Kavanaugh he lose his seat he ended up for reelection in five minutes here and the folks in West Virginia are not going to go along with Joe mansion if he if he were to undercut Brett Kavanaugh on this matter\nAlthough in other breaking news this morning\nAnd this is an insane story that underscores the vagaries of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and the first place Christine Blasey Ford was the woman who made those allegations there's a new story from the wall Street Journal that is truly a shocking story and it's getting undercover and of course by a lot of folks in the mainstream\nThey're saying a lot of people in the right wing media they're picking up on it everyone should be picking up on it because they kind of crazy story there was a story from the wall Street Journal\nQuote a friend that Christine Blasey Ford told the FBI investigators and that she felt pressured by Dr Ford the allies to visit her initial statement that you knew nothing about an alleged sexual assault by teenage Brett Kavanaugh which he later updated say she believed but couldn't corroborate Dr ... according to people familiar with matter\nComing up I have to tell you the backstory of the way it is ...

nothing to do with Brett Kavanaugh it has nothing to do a Democrat or Republican it has to do with three professors who prank a bunch of academic turtle that turned out\nThere are these professors\nAnd he threw professor Helen ... and Peter ...\nAnd they decided to praying all these stupid academic journal doubt they're hearing Peter but that he and explaining what exactly they didn't print in journal\nIt's approximately June twenty Seventeen I along with two other concerned academic Goshen cook wrote I've been writing intentionally broke an academic papers missing them to highly respected journal or gender race and similar we did this\nWe're a similar topic we did this to expose a political corruption taking hold up the university\nAnd this morning several of these papers have been accepted and highly respected journal [noise] one claimed that dog pumping it can be taken as evidence of rape culture racially on our show I'm not going to lie on the\nBoard\n\nLeave them I don't have a few minutes\nOkay it's so good it so they said what did they knew they submitted all the same paper than in feminist and gender studies journals and they all got printed in the paper the unreal that or the dog park paper you heard him described there are about why dog company incident that rape culture\nI talked about on the show and they wrote a paper claiming\nThat when the guy privately pleasure themself up thinking about a woman without her consent and back to that forever finding out about it that he committed sexual violence against her\nThat was printed in a clear studies journal\nAnd they argue that I wrote a paper arguing\nThat the reason super intelligent AI is potentially dangerous is because they didn't being program [laughter] they argue that the reason super intelligent AI\nAs potentially dangerous is because it is being programmed to be masculine is an imperialist using Mary ... Frankenstein and like Kenyan psychoanalysis\nThat their feminine ad paper they argue that a fat body is legitimately built body and the foundation for introducing a category for bad body building into the sport of professional bodybuilding\nWent into a journal called fat study [laughter]\n\nOh that's so good they they found something called feminist English geology okay this is a real big on merrily\nSo they copied the idea and then they wrote a feminist astronomy paper arguing the feminine and queer astrology should be considered part of the science of astronomy which will brand and intrinsically\nAnd researchers loved at\nThat and they wrote a paper ... people in the workplace and met menu that male preserved to enact dying macho masculinity masculinity just courses in a way

implements that are you in time of intimacy typically by men who are not straight\nSo that they asked the question why don't straight men tend to pleasure themselves yeah use of being implement that are generally used by gay men and what would happen if they did\nAnd their paper it's printed in sexuality and culture when they concluded that men would be less trans phobic and more feminine if they allow themselves to be treated in a way that straight men typically are not particularly fond of\nYou know that they tried to avoid why we've tried to avoid going to ... just as often as possible to visit them in a very that's one of course they submitted a paper it's on the social the feminist social work turtle affiliate hey this is what they did a feminist rewrite of a chapter from my income\nIt literally took a chapter of my income they're playing some of the language with eminent language and I committed to a deli and affiliate printed it is it fair to say that all of this stuff is garbage that all of these journals are garbage I think it's pretty fair to say that\nComing up our Sunday special feature on survivor camera and caffeine to talk about all things on the pretty great Juanita Morris's mentioning earlier\nAnd on the appetizers with people I mean I have did you ever do plays in high school or anything I didn't know it was an all boys school it's worth that much we can do you [laughter] well I'm well acting and helps you\nUnderstand other people a lot because you have to put yourself in other people's shoes\nUm sometimes it's easy and people can just read a script in and become someone else but I I it took a lot more for me I I very often play the bad guy which one didn't really helped me I played the movie with little shop horse I was a dentist and there's not a lot of humanity in search for it's hard to put yourself in the shoes of somebody who is a psychopath\nBut you know I I go\nTo notify me but [laughter]\nBut I I'm you know I developed a deep empathy for my fellow human being that\nI that drove me very very passionate emotional sense than my school gets shot up and I say okay I've heard of Sandy Hook I've heard of combine I've heard all these things and when you're in a room and you hear about those schools everything gets island everything gets awkward everything gets\nMelancholy I Can't have that when I when people hear Stillman Douglas I don't want them to think about people crying I Want them to think about people taking action no matter what that actually might be\nSo that would take me through that day what what exactly would that day like for you\nSo before the shooting I was in my drama class we're halfway through a song that I was doing again that's on TALK garbage but I remember the special needs kids in my school let out a half hour before everybody else because they are picked up at the bus\nAnd special needs kids in my school let out a half hour before everybody else because they're picked up at the bus move and they have to be picked up before the buck has come so on days riot school and my mother was at work I picked up my brother and I brought up the drama he loves it he got pension when the girls seem even like you know he felt like a\nCool guy which he is and I it was about two twenty and I was supposed to pick him up to ten so I said oh crap I gotta go I rush out of the drama room run over to pick up my brother 'cause I have to be back from my song\nAnd suddenly there's fire alarm ... ... is the buses are about the common I'm with a special needs students and we have to go in the ... to avoid the fire\nYou know there are a lot of very high functioning students than the ESE programs that someone Douglas there are a lot of lower functioning students but it's a hassle to get in the parking lot and I was just like okay this is annoying especially being outside of the class you're supposed to be entering a fire joke then you got to tell the teacher they have to walk either staff to make sure everybody's got in for\nAn hour out there waiting this kid near me says shooter I look at him and I say one that's not cool that's not cool it all eyes on something very inappropriate or you know if it reaches a younger audience would avoid it\nBut suddenly everybody starts running back into the school and there are teachers that getting us inside of my initial thought is okay where the ... and several other classes but we're with ESE cloud in the middle of the of the loop and there was a they must have been a fake fire drill and the buses whereabouts comes there like everybody get inside so you don't get hit by the buses\nWere sent into a classroom the lights turn off and I say something's going on here took me a couple of minutes to realize that there was there was gunfire I heard conflicting rumors there was massive thing to say this hysteria and the room but it was the type of hysteria where you are hysterical but still have to be quiet because you don't know where the gunman is\nInstead of in ... you know rain right next door to us I no idea I didn't hear any gunfire I thought I did but when you know there's a shooter and you hear something you think it's gone far it's natural\nAnd everybody was telling me conflicting stories and this is just the people next to us they were whispering they said fifty people were killed two people were killed\n'em this teacher was killed that wasn't that this person was the shooter this person the shooter and I spent the whole time thinking I really really really hold my brother doesn't understand what's going on\nAnd and that some moral Kwon do I tell them what's going on because these are and the truth or do I allow him the ignorance of the the blissful ignorance for the time being\nBut there were also a lot of other special needs students there and some of them were non verbal but non verbal doesn't mean you can make noise and some of them were yelling and some of them are making loud shriek and hollers and fortunately the special needs specialist at someone dug us rebels keep everybody together and it was\nIt was a problem that we saw so quickly but as we ... we were able to be released a SWAT Team came in the first thing we saw his rifle in the glass cracks and we thought we were toast\nBut in the SWAT Team came in we run outside I get picked up by my parents at a hotel a couple of hours later and and then came a week of chaos but also piece of ... all of the laws of physics kind of didn't exist in Parkland it was as if\nThe world and stopped and there was this theory calm but also this fiery madness it was it was a time where I said\nIn this in its lack of ... well nobody around us knows what's going on I have to step up and say here's what I think I I couldn't have the ... the the cameras game and I couldn't have them coming from people crying I had to have in common I had to have people stand in front of them and say we cannot have this anymore\nWe demand the change we are not Parkland is not the city of people who are going to encourage you to join our melancholy Parkland is this and the people who are going to encourage you to take action\nAnd he could enter druthers about how the media treats these sorts of situations obviously you don't ... the media does what the media new which is they cover the news when it happened but if you had your druthers emotionally I just\nPolitically in every way what would you what would you have the media how did you have the media cover these sorts of situations\nWell isn't double edged sword because on the one hand I was on national news well there were bodies that were still warm and people had been buried yet\nAnd that and that at the time I didn't really think about it but in retrospect it makes me question without appropriate on the one hand the cameras are going to leave and I want to make sure the message that I Believe is right gets across while the cameras up there\nOn the other hand people are dead and and I know that I don't regret anything I did because I Know what I was doing I did because I believed it was right and and that's the best I can do\nBut in regards to how the media coverage that I think that sit in the names of shooters should never be released daily wire covers that very well I Know that there are multiple pundits as well that do not named the shooters I think that there's a lead making the shooter celebrities is flipping the inappropriate and I think that\nI think that I was very often treated like an expert when I'm not I'm not the expert on anything\nIn the days immediately following obviously there are a lot of cameras there people are looking for comment when didn't Jew and any other member of the march for our lives really started to consolidate into a group\nShare so February fifteenth we're all separated and it was February sixteen two days after the shooting that I was able to kind of ... who is ready to speak out and get them together and we all came to my house I thought of doing the march in DC and Michael is posted pajamas in my bathroom\nAnd I and I ... I said OK if the whole nation in in one way or another has galvanize right now what can we do\nHow can we materialized that's a nice pair and let's get everyone to DC unless demand change\nSo quickly the team started to grow more and more people became part or all my friends from the other but I knew where well spoken and eloquent joined some people just showed up at my house and that some of them ended up becoming very\nPassionate and well spoken advocates for what we were advocating for but it was by what I Would call February nineteenth our team was together\nSo that the tactics that much of our lives you came under a lot of president criticism including from people like me because obviously at the very beginning particularly there was a lot of focus on some of the stuff he talked about earlier\nOr there's an implication that was put out by particle members of the team on you know in in public settings that if there was a disagreement about politics that this was a reflection of lack of of care about what had happened on ... what do you think could've been done to mitigate against that\nTo be honest with you a lot of that was me a lot of that was me telling my friends you know these people don't agree with us that they don't care you know they they they care more about their guns and they care about getting getting killed anything I'll criticize about march for our lives really comes from me uh I started it I was the ... I was was bringing my friend's here's all the time\nI Know I Know the people in my ... and all of them pretty much like the back of my head I know that these are people who really just one of the world and be a better place and a lot of our areas and messaging particularly if you don't like us you don't care came from me\nAnd I believe that and I believe that until relatively recently\nI'm embarrassed certainly but I'm also I'm I'm not losing sleep over it because I believed it\nWhat do you think change that for you I mean he talked about being in Texas but\nObviously they didn't for for those of us were watching from afar the first time that I Try you on TV I think was probably during the CNN town hall about which was obviously a huge ratings was with a big TV event I criticize Jake Tapper Fort Hood I suggested that the media really should've if they want to have a discussion the issues they should be a discussion of the issues as opposed to sort of an emotionally driven event\nOn it ... ... what changed from from there to where you are now which is that if somebody wants to have discussions based on the issues\nThink I I reached out for a bit on I can tell you the exact catalyst there wasn't really a moment where clicked on me that I Need to start opening this conversation but I realized that it was a less never going to get rid of the right the rights never going to get rid of the left they certainly have all the parties change over time but there's ... as long as we have a binary system\nOver time but there's ... as long as we have a binary system it's a binary system and\nAnd half the country doesn't want the world to be a bad place I thought that I thought that half the country and the Republicans were rainbow I think that there are some great new people on the right and left are are both lovely and people in the right and left her most awful I don't want to say there's very few people on both sides\nThat has been used in ways I can never accept\nBut I I I learned that there's such a that we're all people I mean I said this yesterday a lot of people were politicized in nine eleven and and I said look we're Americans today and I learned that overall where Americans and we have a ... there's ... there's a\nNational understanding that we need to be a better place in right now looking back and didn't it didn't like this we America has a whole is responsible for this division and we need to come together\nAnd you want to hear the rest of that Sunday special ... you have to do is go subscribe over SoundCloud or I can go check out a YouTube as well I can listen to record that Congress acres mailbag in Ventura", "show_name": "Questions & Answers", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "06"}
