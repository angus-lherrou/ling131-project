I mean I don't even ... that makes me speechless I mean obviously we can we can look around and see that there's a lot of activity going on right now ah and it sounds like the mortgage rates are sustaining themselves is really helping\nOut with all of that it is and even though a lot of people are saying you know the rates are going up um historical either at a low\nThere you go to that that's really good information to know so um as far as uh being involved as a real it or do you have a lot of things going on in the community\nYeah for me I like to volunteer with meals on wheels where I get free rides on the carts provide by west usa uh-huh and so we get free rides the people around town and then from that the donations go to meals on wheels oh that's excellent ...\nThat we see that I'm going around quite a bit people ask about it all the time it would be the red go cart around town or a golf cart a that's a\nYup and rewrite and and and explain a little bit so that's that's the right Prescott ride Prescott program and so what you do is you give people rides from the parking lot to stores and that sort of thing is that\nYeah within a few blocks of downtown ... need to go you can call us up and go\nMhm very good uh so tell us a little bit more about what's going on in the real estate world that you can that would that our listeners would be interested in [noise]\nAnd ah this summer you introduced me to this young man who's sitting next to you in a cowboy hat\nBrad Brad Williams who is an artist and we're so impressed and you've been so generous to donate a bronze for this for this fundraiser\nAnd we're here and we're just we want to hear from you how you create these bright beautiful Bronson we thank you so much for donating or You're welcome a\nI was approached by Tommy a few years ago a\nTo donate a bronze for the Christmas lighting and I think we've done through for five years at least four yeah so it's it's really turned into a a\nA money maker and um\nPeople I Know they they draw for it on a on\nA first down in Las Vegas yeah you are national files rodeo so I never get to see that but I'm One of these days I'm going to drive over the weekend and and make him show me what you guys do\nBut he's a life size cowboy and horses over in Vegas when the rodeo is the finals over there\nBut uh this this really adds to our uh I don't wanna say credibility the success or we have different ways of donating and and helping letting ever done one of them is a items to live and for the ... sign an option\nAnd or the other one is we have Christmas balls if you can imagine them on the back bar cut out and you know when I ten dollars or a thousand dollars and you get a raffle tickets\nWhich goes towards the bronze and people have learned that the rounds is something you know forty five hundred dollar value it's probably been the average I was in the wrong he's done and they're yeah you know there are some almost three feet tall and\nVery rarely do very well done and it does help us solve\nOur package for a reason to uh donate for the lighting is one thing I don't know how much time we have but ah with all the people involved in the chamber and bread and the committee and all and I suddenly realized the other day that there's this town has a lot of\nFundraisers and they're all good and or they wouldn't be there but they're usually driven towards one particular area with a winter night or tonight\nUh uh you know ... uh\nYeah at CERN ... ceremony yeah\nBut the lighting we started out in July and August getting ready to go party on November first December first we as a drawing for the the bronze and in the lighting said he's a ... a Martin Luther King Day middle of January so my point\nIs is unique in the fact that in many many many people get to take advantage of it and see it\nAnd uh uh they are\nAble to come back as many times as they want it doesn't cost them ... percent to see it the way we do have to find the\nAnswer wins do donate your donating to something that I think is everlasting and puts us on the map and helps the city with sales tax and helps the tourism is that tax helps emergency cell downtown and ah\nWe get a brand little publicity yeah and ah everybody's happy well\nIt it it does all of those things Tommy thank you for sharing that because we're learning that this is probably one of the strongest economic drivers in the in in ... uh as far defense going bringing folks to the area and on that day December first\nThat's actually a very high retail sales day two people come in for the parade and then they stay for the courthouse lighting and and its traditions you know it's it's people from out of town that want to make their traditions to come here but it's a residents to that really enjoy it\nAnd um the bronze this year Pratt is stockholders meeting and I remember you\nWe pulled us out of the truck here down by ... when we were having lunch and um it's a beautiful piece you want to talk about the inspiration of that piece\nOf I just I just had the idea at\nOne point that ah that ah\nThe discourse in this cowboy and this dog have gotten together to plan their day and I was out tons of grasping at a title and I felt a little stock yeah livestock so stock holders meeting and it came out pretty good they are just so planning their day I think\nI

I've been with a company sends an open and twenty Seventeen or it's owned by Terry and Thompson um I've worked for them in general for almost six years and other businesses that they had a ... open the winning team in\nA started as a survival first like build it and then I wasn't server advantaged it and then I moved up here\nTo mile general manager of this one well we're glad to have you here how do you like Prescott so far I I Love it when king keep you then right\nI Can't wait to hear your story 'cause I mean you're in you're in a great profession and I want to hear about what you do for the Ricki cricket here in Prescott and I know we're talking about some fun proves that you're working on that we ought to hear about all the great brew yeah or\nOr some so uh I moved up here to be the general manager I'm ahead some other managers and whatnot I became hair I'm thinking we're going to be a restaurant and doing all that and I'm judging by the crowd over the past couple of months I decided to give it a table service\nAnd how to walk up window and made it look like a food truck so it's a it's all ... foods\nAnd a little like finger foods um by and stuff like that I still have burgers and for the first week but like I have my burgers back we'll have burger and a beer specials were sitting at a burger here for ten bucks\nUm which is a pretty good deal yeah absolutely oh yeah so I I Do that um do all the food orders all the beer orders liquor orders open pose\n[laughter] yeah well\nI liked that walk up to the window I was there last week with the young professionals and I saw that kind of in the corner so now that you bring it to my attention to like it did look like a food truck a that's pretty that's pretty genius you can come up with that concept\nOr do I owe it to the owner to al ... is yeah he and\nHis sons that's actually really cool so the one of the regular cricket and came in he would have dreams about how it would look up and then he'd write it down and\nTell us what to build and build it so same thing with a food truck you had a dream one night and he was like you know what let's do this let's have like the food still really good yeah um you just give you a ... and you come to the window or it will have it done and it's just a few minutes new come pick it up you have everything for you so\nAwesome good beer good food yeah absolutely and you know I liked the idea of the bite because that that is the trend in you know it's hard to eat so much and you know I think that's a great that's awesome I Love the\nAtmosphere much different yeah it makes it more it's fun like you'd meet lots of people right I'm just waiting for your food to back up to the food truck if I don't yeah kind of neat as it brings more like a bar and very atmosphere and I think that would really work what we want\nAnd so I'm going to ditch the couple tables unpleasant pool tables out all have Cornel outside a giant chain gun that all have some fun games I'm Still in transition film of all the you know a couple of weeks before I get everything together but we're\nOn our way wonderful and so tell us a little bit about the rickety cricket ah ah atmosphere goals
