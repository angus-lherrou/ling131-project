I'm no Sanford going today he has the day off I think we might make him work next week Dr Iran will be joining me any second I'm often I'm sitting here with Bill Murray row in the studio I don't know if you heard that earlier when I was when I first started I was sitting at chase field I thought there was a playoff game down there but\nNow September kind of messed that up but there's a lot of play off games going on as we speak as a couple that are already in the books\nA Cleveland Houston Houston uh prevailed ... this morning it was\nYou know probably an afternoon game in Houston but it started eleven o'clock\nAnd Houston won that one I Want to say seven to two for land or on the mound thought that was gonna be a nice little under a game where they went over but Houston one as predicted going on right now Colorado Milwaukee it's about the six or seven day and we'll get an update from doctor and a little bit of Milwaukee was one of a Colorado was threatening\nAnd then a little bit later on we'll keep your breath to it all\nYankees and the red Sox there'll be playing there again one of the American league division series for thirty two first pitch will keep you up on all that and then later tonight another game of fourth game it's like\nJust so much fun for baseball fans Atlanta at the LA Dodgers game two Dodgers one the first one six to nothing so that their second game if a six thirty seven first pitch\nSo when we're done no Donnan back game but you got the Dodgers you can kind of probably hate go for the Atlanta when it got in the yard day Swanson ... diamond backs and a big underdog even though and they did lose at first game six so awful tonight\nYou've got college football there's four games with two of no Georgia Tech at Louisville to four o'clock ESPN game and Utah State at BYU that's a six o'clock ESPN two game\nAlso tonight on ESPN just a pre season basketball game but if I my memory serves me correct\nIt's going to be played in Seattle and there hasn't been a game played in Seattle a long time Sacramento's me playing Golden State at seven thirty again on ESPN\nAnd Seattle of course trying to get an expansion or somebody to move over there this weekend are tons of games going on and talk to a dog now just about all this baseball stuff but a lot of college football especially the pack twelve Arizona State in action on Saturday there playing Colorado it's a one o'clock game and forces on the pack twelve network\nIn Colorado's for no but they haven't put anybody good\nAh Arizona State that's the kind of a pick 'em game so\nAgain we'll go dig into that one of the California bears are traveling the Tucson to play the Arizona Wildcats that's at seven o'clock Saturday Night and then on Fox Sports one so everybody can tune into that and then maybe more importantly the home opener for the Arizona Coyotes\nWell interestingly enough Cal started out pretty good and I started to think oh this is kind of interesting and for some reason they assign like about six\nOf the primo Arizona high school athletes to go to Cal next year including a quarterback and what have you so recruiting wise they're they're really picking it up but I keep waiting for the real you of a quarterback cultivate\nTo show up I don't know if he's got an injured ankle of the new coach Kevin someone\nHas a different philosophy and he doesn't want to turn 'em loose let 'em run but last year he was mentioned in the Heisman conversation\nThis year I think I don't think he's averaged a couple of yards or rush and he's hardly ever carrying the ball so you almost would have to think he's injured so if he's ready to to bust out and play I think you could very easily\nBeat cow but that's a fluid situation and nobody's really\nExplained it I've heard like goes ankles been bugging him or what have you and and last week I think they were losing twenty four to nothing to southern Cal and then\nSouthern Cal started doing one of these shoot yourself in the foot things fumbling the ball and you know making mistakes left and right and dumped penalties and they ended up only only winning that game like you said by four points\nOff and not have been a nice one for the ... to win at home because southern cow has a freshman quarterback and as a season progress has I think they're going to get better and better but I think if I had to pick\nI Would probably go with the ... and the points because one of these games cultivate their haul everything quarterback has got to put it together\nAnd if he's not injured his new coach Kevin someone asked her to recognize this guy's a game changer let them carry the ball and let's go back to what he was doing last year it's amazes me that he has a doctor that philosophy yet but he wants to be a pocket passer and throw the ball more than run the ball that's the problem\nOr one guy that has broken out and you've been preaching about this guy a issue running back into Benjamin the sophomore running back he went out and he got he got off to an okay start the season he had two hundred and eighty three are touched on the first games\nBut in talking about breakout games last week against Oregon State you were probably there he sent a school record he had three hundred and sixteen yards rushing for touchdowns of course he earned conference offensive player of the week on a limb like can you be the player of the week that's often supplier or so maybe it was also\nThe and believe it or not the national player of the week thorough Campbell award went to him as well so you not only got the pack twelve offensive player of the week he made the national headlines of the Earl Campbell war that's a that's a pretty big deal\nWell he's he's in action and we're going to talk about it right now about the game against Colorado\nOr other guys were talking about individuals and you've been preaching ... when you brought a couple of interviews to the listeners from him another guy even talking about is our senior quarterback many Wilkins he's a he's a hundred and Seventy seven passing yards shy of seven thousand for his career he has forty two touchdown passes\nAnd one of his favorite targets keel Harry who's got twenty two hundred career receiving yards has four to Nineteen yard this year with five touchdowns on thirty one catches so look for those guys to hook up\nAnd doc I'm like and you were going to hear what you have to say because you're the real experts but I think number Twenty one ranked number Twenty one Colorado is probably one of the worst ranked number Twenty one team ever yes there for a no\nBut you look at who they beat and they beat in Colorado State Nebraska New Hampshire and UCLA and those four teams are combined one when sixteen losses\nSo I kind of like a a shoe who's a little battle tested they've played even though like you said they haven't won a game on the road they've come close they played some what was it a number of ten when or when they played a\nWas number Chan a Michigan State was Fifteen so they were to win this came there will be the third ranked team that her Edwards has knocked off but again they have to overcome the is there a is such a young team people don't realize is on the fence aside their more experience than what have you but they're playing like\nFour to six true freshmen on defense than for defense hasn't been doing as well as all issue fans like to see so that's been their weakness oh\nThis is a huge game and you're right a Colorado their ranking maybe a mirage let's put it put it that way so lightly yeah ... ... ... the ... the one problem like you mentioned many Wilkins Manny hasn't played up to snuff\nAnd again at Oregon State Caine thank goodness Benjamin one for three hundred and twelve yards and he actually beat the record of shoe fans that go way back like I Do recognize us named Ben Malone\nIn Nineteen Seventy three uh two hundred and fifty yards it was against Oregon State and that's what Frank Kush was the coach and the Malone brothers Bannon are alone or a kind of the backbone of of ASU football for a long period of time but many I think he only through for like a hundred and sixty yard said\nAfterwards I went to the interviews and what have you and he had the flu and her mother sure that he should even be playing but he was like no I'm going out there and I guess\nHe was thrown up in the hospital and throwing up on the ... incident\nYou know he was not feeling well so if they want to have that big big game from you know that might have been a little more competitive I still think that are knocked Oregon State off to Oregon states uh pretty horrible team but a Manny has yet to really take advantage of having to kill Harry\nWho's really been moving up on the draft words in the NFL eat\nA lot of guys are projecting him right now as of top ten pick maybe the cardinals could get them since they need some wide receivers but on the kill and man he welcomes need to hook up a little bit more because that's that's a pretty dynamic weapon now yet and and I've got a little cut up and later on her arm\nKind of laughs at that and he's like well you know\nKill an average in two touchdowns a game and he looked around the room and it was like to touch down I think that's pretty good what are you guys think you know and I didn't realize he had been scoring that many but he has been returning pawns\nRealize he'd been scoring that anybody has been returning pawns\nHe's been running the wildcat formation or as we call it the the Sparky formation uh in the backfield\nAnd he's been bugging her med words to let them for all passed but this kid can do it at all any of the local kid Chandler high school so it's kind of cool to see I'm doing well but uh once a Manny is back to form and start throwing the ball and the two the keel area a little bit more\n... could really be dynamic\nAnd the malone's one if not both made it to the NFL right yeah yeah I've seen their football cards when I'm hanging out at the batter's box you go yeah yeah they've got some football cards out they're pretty big stars back in the early to mid seventies\n... they were from Illinois Arizona if memory serves correct them they were you know kind of under recruited like a lot of guys Kush would find and then they blossom into the big stars so\nNineteen Seventy three until two thousand and Eighteen that's a lot of years that two hundred and fifty yards stood up and uh you know just made a mockery of it I don't know if you had a chance to watch that game but\nHis runs were amazing to me forty two yards forty five yards that he\nHas this innate ability and he's I think he's about five eleven two hundred and some pounds you know he is he's built pretty good but not like a big bruising back he likes runner right up the middle and\nIs this ability to pick his way through holes and then once it gets into that second level he has really strong you trade arms guys that he can really be change of direction on a dime I I'm impressed they only a sophomore they probably would have been better off to a red shirt on last year but\nYou know oh and I just popped in my head the reason I asked you beat Colorado in Tempe last year you know Benjamin\nThey played him and he out of the biggest game of the season and he was the reason that the sun devils actually won that game so you got to crack out I'm In Boulder, Colorado\nNo we can't spend too much more time on the sun devil even though they are an interesting story and one reason I don't get to see them very much is this was disappointing about this game packed twelve network not everybody gets the pack twelve network in this one ten kicked off\nAgainst number Twenty one of the nation even though they shouldn't be\nAnd that's why this line is maybe a good deal\nIs on the pack twelve network or Colorado Colorado favorite by one and a half points Arizona State leads the series eight games the one a lot of people were saying Colorado is confident but the sun devils are well tested and I've got one question I ask you this is true I saw stats a day and I can hard time believing this\nThe sun devils haven't had a running back fumble way the foot ball in twenty four games is that sound possible can you think is is you know ... that would be awesome if they haven't been turned at least they did the running backs haven't been coughing up the ball\nWell I can remember two games that go trail on Smith fumbling the ball in on a drive in it might've been against San Diego state that kind of turn that game around so I don't think that's correct\nYeah I don't know I mean it seems like or something crazy to me and not let me\nLet me dropped us into the show goes along maybe a little bit later I got I've got some cuts from you know and then from her Mm two that are kind of interesting and maybe we can get those in\nYeah if we have time but I Want to we got a break coming up uh Billy's ran off I think he's got some sort of crazy emergency going up all got played commercial here in a few minutes but one thing I don't want to bore too many people with all like like a issue issue but I Do want to talk to you believe it or not dock your heaven 'cause I've been reading up on Arizona State basketball\nHave reloaded big time and some of their little red shirt guys not little but big are now going to build play so between what you had to say when I just told you from this one article from this John Marshall\nUganda believe right things are looking good down there in Tempe even basketball\nOh I think so not all take a while because a lot of these guys are freshmen haven't played together and what have you but I've heard reports from workouts that they are allowed to do amongst each other that\nThere's these guys are pretty serious said and it's going to be a lot more physical style of play which I'm I'm looking forward to but I'm really excited to see the Serbian kid who will be a freshman and everybody tells me he can run the floor and jump and\nThat's all they need ... even if you just put his hands up in front of the basket odd out of seven footer ASU hasn't\nReally have that luxury especially an athletic uh type player like that so yeah it it could be good and uh if you had that many players sometimes these kids want to play ... right away that might transfer out or something but I think early you'll be able to\nGive everybody playing time and get everybody to buy in\nTo what he's ... he's trying to do and uh yeah it's going to be a really interesting basketball season I'm pumped up about it\nWell one last Sunday and I know we're a issue and it's a death and we're going to stop after this and get on some other stuff but this guy door\nIt looks like Bobby Hurley called him Lou like Ellie you loot door to him because he's got a French kind of name he's six foot four freshman guard out of Montreal and against these a relentless defender who's good one on one off the ball and\nIt lists defender who's good one on one off the ball and flying flying in for weak side blocks he's already impressed her early in the short term in Arizona State and then it's the finish with this is a pretty long one sentence quote by Bobby Hurley about this door guy\nWhen it's all said and done I don't know if I'll coach a better defense of guard the door\nAs soon as he got here this loop door had an immediate impact on everything we do he is such a presence in practice and affects practice in so many different ways he attacks the basket it's super athletic and strong and again I think he's got the potential to be just an incredible defender\nSo some pretty good phrase coming from a pretty good guard and Bobby Hurley who's been around the block a few times so while a not only that\nMike Remy Martin last year was one of the best defense of guards in the pack twelve and he's a ... I read that that too that coaches said he's already putting this kid may be above Remy which is saying a lot\nAnd I'm In the finish this thing about this pay to play thing and you of aids mentioned there even though like you said they just signed a bunch of guys the people in play here as a Brian ... senior who um is kind of talking first son Brian bone Bowen junior who your eyes playing an Australian ... Brian Bull in junior\nIs the kid element of many others but these are the people stepping forward who through an agent\nWas offered money and and this guy's been testifying just in the last day or two I guess Thursday's when they went and testified but Brian bones seniors testify to that that his uh his son and him were offered a lot of times they do this they offered the dad so they can kind of they think they can get around things that way but they were offered\nFifty thousand dollars from the University of Arizona so there you go\nA hundred and fifty thousand dollars at Oklahoma State or a hundred thousand dollars a crate and bones said there was some interest from Oregon but he didn't recalled the cash offer a bowl and told them Manhattan jury it was his understand the offers were being made by assistant coaches at the schools\nHe said the Oklahoma offer which included an additional eight grand for car came from there then assistant coach Lamont Evans\nEven though they defend you know everybody says no not me and you're right about the Louisville thing that was involved the son Brian Bull in junior eventually landed at Louisville and it's also this has to do with Nike and Adidas they're being thrown in there to of course they all say no but in ... but Louisville's India's a deed at school\nAnd the defendants engineer to promise of a hundred grand for his family and then that's why Oregon got in there because they're Nike and his back and forth but there are some serious stuff going on and uh the the college basketball\nGiants might fall a little bit and you of it like you said it's a wonder anybody's going there because uh this could have some repercussions now and the very near future for them so\nTo me I still think things are looking a little tougher you of a in why after looking at what you had to say and what I read the day and all that a shoe basketball's looking pretty strong coming up up probably any week now and of course\nAs you just talked about in the first quarter of the show and a issues football team in action tomorrow at one ten pac twelve network unfortunately I think they're going to be Colorado in Colorado there one of the worst twenty more than one ranked teams ever in the nation or the four teams that they've beaten or one and sixteen overall\nIssues a little more battle tested so looking forward to that and the whole pack twelve schedule and I guess to put all that the rest and you're not on top of every last one of them but\nPick a game any game maybe all the games the evening games when it comes to the pack you've got Washington state at Oregon State you got this is probably a bigger one Utah Stanford at the seven thirty ESPN game a if there's any other one that jumps out at ya ah any thoughts or any words of wisdom money and the other packed twelve games or you just concentrating on Sparky\nWhether you know washing is UCLA they should crush them Stanford in Utah is the game of interest Stafford surprisingly to me they got stopped by Notre Dame big time at Notre Dame but uh they had been playing pretty ... pretty well and they're of course going to be battling it out with Washington\nFor the north so ah Utah if they lose this came there probably out of the race in the south so it's an important game to them um Washington state should win easily over Oregon State a kind of looking through the the rest of the season\nI think that's about it I think a couple of teams have some some buys a we already talked about the use of a in a surprise and I'm gonna I'm gonna take the UAE because one of these games like I said before that\nQuarterback has to be set free or maybe the injury will be sufficient enough for him to cut on and run and do what he did last year because he was almost unstoppable last year\nWell Stanford's favored by five at home against Utah so again that's going to be a good one and Washington on the road it looks like a Twenty one point favorite over UCLA so\nThat's what I see something out at me but I'm\nA lot of the good games in college that uh we we talked about being a show check your local listings of course the big local game would be Prescott badgers on the road but not very far they're just going to Prescott value to play the Bradshaw mountain\nBears huge matchup maybe one of the biggest match ups ever they're ranked one and two\nIn the Grand Canyon media foot ball poll one and two in the Grand Canyon standings rational mountain seven and all like they've tied to a school record they can go eight in order to be a new record for Bradshaw a mountain of course ... playing very very well a little bit of a surprise\nThere quarterbacks a little ... we'll see how that goes but back to baseball do you have any um any final score anything going on in that Milwaukee Colorado game of the last time I looked it was one nothing Milwaukee and about the eighth inning\nRight now I got to nothing brewers of\nTwo out in the bottom of the eight of you know I don't know how up today my computer is that as an sitting there for a while but they have bases loaded with two outs to not seen a brewers over the Rockies and uh I can try to get even a fresher ...\nThat's good and then a little bit later on we'll check it every once in a while and then uh we just under ... underway as the Yankees and the red Sox game one of the er an el division series between those two teams and ...\nYou know we can talk about that one a little bit too but I Want I Want to say one thing I think you'll agree with me a lot of fans they're not paying attention maybe they don't realize this but one reason to kind of root for the brewers\nAnd uh you know how I like de Roberts and its course managed to the Dodgers when everybody hates but\nCraig council is the manager of the brewers and everybody can remember Craig counsel was integral parts and the two thousand one world series run that we had and I think he's doing a really good job at a managing editors bench coach pat Murphy used to be the head coach at ASU\nSo there's there's some Arizona connections there going on and uh went hurt my feelings at all to see this brewers team\nOh go ahead and had actually won the national league and Craig did a great thing yesterday it worked out for 'em didn't work out for Oakland but he pitched that game with his bullpen kind of backwards and they ended up winning the game and then today what traditional with a regular starters and what have you but\nCraig council a there's a guy you can really root for\nYeah and what was interesting was his bullpen had a one hit or going into the ninth inning against the mighty Colorado Rockies Orion hitter but Jeffries he's ...\nAround the Rockies Orion hitter but Jeffries he's the one that almost blew that thing they're lucky they got away with only the two runs effected the Milwaukee players were like man we we thought we dodged a bullet that could have been a lot worse than if it had been any worse they would have lost the nine instead of they want it in ten\nSo excited that was an exciting game the rock the car or the um Braves and the Dodgers in a long ball and it's funny a land out she out hit the Dodgers were the Dodgers got a few walks in you know the older we were three run home runs and stuff\nSo they power themselves into a six to nothing when they've got Kurdish on the mountain today even though he hasn't been pitching as well as ... old and he's going to begin Sanchez the over under seven in that game I kind of like the over", "year": "2018", "show_name":
