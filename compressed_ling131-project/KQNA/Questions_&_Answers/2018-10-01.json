then you know take it away until it's about the event\nUm Chino valley cultures we've been around for a long time we specialize in making comfort close\nWe specialize in making comfort close to go out into the Chino valley community um all the way up to ash work we are a group of about sixty women and we give away about two hundred close here\nUm we fund that through our semi annual quilt show that's one of the ways we do it our trail of quilts\nUm and we just we try and help out our community ... by making you know a quote that you can stay warm in and a lot of our costs going to our school system\nSo talked about comfort quilts in particular and what those are and who they should you know typically go to and so forth\nUm the comfort quilts are usually a lap size sometimes all the way up to a full size quote we give them into the Chino valley and asked for a school districts\nUm when they go to all the different schools we on the quilt guild do not determine who gets are close that's all done through the school through their counselors there nurses\nBut it's um usually children in need or children who have been in a bad situation that just need something to wrap around them to call their own\nAnd so from you know babies on up is that pretty much all the way we give into the preschools all the way up to the senior high\nAnd we have a special group of at Chino Valley High school ... for our seniors where they tell us how many of their children are perhaps I don't want to say homeless because that's not the word they use but it's it's children that are and\nStress situations you may be camping on a couch or whose families are you know in need and they that's what they get for graduation from us is they get a quilt and how long have you been doing this\nI'm I've been in Chino valley for twelve years the club killed spin around about Twenty one Ninety One um since they've been a formal some form of quote group our oldest member is Ninety One years old\n...

you make in a week I'm curious or or a month and then how many do you do you give him away group I'm real beyond the whole brewing an\nAverage of about two hundred comfort quilts a year while hook 'em sometimes a little more sometimes a little laughs it just depends on our members\nUm by an individual person you know you can make a close in a couple of days if you really that's all you do um but you know and then there's the quote that takes you two years to make you know ... yeah or two ago [laughter] um so you know it just depends on what you're making it for\nTim Lee at one of our meetings
