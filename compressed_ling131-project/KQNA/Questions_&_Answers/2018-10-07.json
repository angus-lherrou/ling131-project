much better that companies engaged in target to probably like\nPolicy at the downside to quite a significant it's fall back into focus on constructed proactive sense given that I can be unintended consequences acquaintance because\nThe problem is you select one particular population in the workplace and then that makes it that population they may not appreciate it but it always has everybody know selected\nThat can be a reaction which is quite negative so you get people to poison into a position and the question is always did they get that because the quota or on their own merit and that's a bit of a button for anybody to deal with\nAll these share criticizing what can we\nSay that because I put that on a certain amount of them we very opposed to something needs to be done about when it falls on went into ... through the pipeline but we think that needs to be down in ... fitness is needing that issue as opposed to having just one of those like crisis coming from Europe [noise]\nBut I think we're in a strange situation at the moment Web Brussels I deciding that they see thinking homo quote wet companies would be fined and sanctions if\nThey didn't have at least forty percent Tibet boards witness and um it's a very safe place to be in because not all companies are they saying that the oil companies are able to move to that situation anytime soon\nAnd so I really do have a great concern that we're talking about legislation rather than that tend not to eat the nation to war more gender balance on board\nCritical we do get gender violence over time but they're on getting stuck incentives like seven companies might take a little longer to get that and set in the areas that are left women they be\nQualified to take on that role and sat in the sex too but I said to me to say that we should stop that was encouraged people to get on with that\nBut I don't think legislation is the way to go at this point in time I think it probably send the signal a nor did she get\nPressure that down the organization the only place because we can make a difference at this point in time is out that I taught and culturally that should actually have all the way down the organization of course the need to grow the base of a strong\nCapable women who were actually able to look that way to organizations\nQuickly and and if there's something in effectively in all honesty we do need a pressure from the board down so that we have bought them up on the top down approach I think that that would be the most helpful way we can actually get that but we could look at different tools that people\nThat we don't look to the usual suspects too I think that leads to this and that took a more diverse pool that we find talented women no matter where they might be\nAnd the question quotas I must say that um it's a controversial one because\nI've been out there trying to make progress and especially in the financial services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress a little bit now more most recently\nBut that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quotas you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender representation and so as a result I I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas but what I Do think we need which is sort of what we're seeing here the pay is a notch\nBecause if there isn't some type of the pressure with a ...\nIf there isn't some type of the pressure\nWith the perception that there are consequences on the back and you know I think the excuse for inaction running so it's really incumbent upon all too I think with that little bit of pressure keeping a spotlight on the issue is that type of thing that hopefully in that light light\nPeople feel that the needs a new and then once they actually start to get a more balanced representation shift a little bit you get to the tipping point becomes organic and it's not for
