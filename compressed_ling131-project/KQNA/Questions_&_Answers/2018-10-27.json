the Republican bringing predicted because Democrats rocket everything there is a lot of times on the right to claim that this is all Republican no hell and suddenly Republicans are good at thing\nNo what what's really happening here in the Democratic math is often Democrats are garbage everything basically when president from the second thing in the new that have very good thing for Republicans when he was the first thing in the news it's a problem\nSo and Democrats spent weeks demonstrating they don't care about due process and that they won't railroaded by simply for political reasons very good for Republicans\nWhen the lead headline is the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats\nSetting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for Republican when the lead headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz in a restaurant and screaming at him and his wife very good for Republicans the best friend up Republicans right now\nIn the insanity of the Democrats and you're seeing that scale in the polls although obviously you're taking it back to the very good economy on the Republican the margin by which voters cross Republican donor Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling really they are Seventeen and the polish amazing also\nI don't want to give credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good thing number one he has taken proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the president of the United states does it make it feel like he has a change after\nAnd usually in midterm elections there was an attempt to vote for change right now what the whole show is that Republicans are actually seen as a party of change well being the party in power\nThat's really unusual usually the party out of power it's you know the party of change because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic the benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he's the guy who's sitting in the state\nThat has very good for Republicans took here is what the latest polls show according to the wall Street Journal motor interest in the mid term elections has searched for record within both parties helping to drive up President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrats lead as a party most preferred to leave Congress according to a new Wall Street journal and between the news all\nThe findings point to an energized electric bumping into by dynamics to bring great uncertainty the outcome of an election just two weeks away and what the polls kind of show is that everything is narrowing nearly two thirds of registered voters Troy high level of interest in the election\nThat has the highest ever recorded in a midterm election since the journal NBC poll began asking the question in two thousand six\nAnd now the reason for that is because largely Democrats than I Do cross we're always going to be energized vote against President Trump but now Republicans are are really mobilized vote against the Democrat I Know that my interest in voting peaked significantly thanks to the Democrats behavior during the Brett Kavanaugh saga and I know that most other Republicans\nFeel the same ones large gap between Republican voters and Democrats voters interest in the election has now been closed sixty eight percent of Republican voters and Seventy two percent of Democrats say they are very interested in the election\nThat has the highest recorded for either party by the survey and image election also President Trump's from job approval rating\nHas jumped to forty seven percent according to the wall Street Journal NBC poll that has the highest mark you ever had in office in that poll is now higher than President Obama the average pull approval rating before the two thousand election now it's worth noting that President Obama got skunk and the two thousand election\nBut with that said President Trump has gained significant approval only forty nine percent disapprove and so that's about as close to ... has ever going to get you never going to be a fifty five percent president he's just your polarizing figure forty seven percent for President Trump is a very good number and that has a reelection number if he gets up to forty seven percent public approval rating he wins reelection and twenty twenty\n\nMy name is ... and James I've been a stock options trade her for twenty three years I used to be an active swing trader but that'll change once I discovered by

bit of an education in down in philosophy which means every week we go through a federal is paper but this week we're all at the federal at forty eight and a steady progress as one written by James Madison and this one method contain got separation of powers in federal is forty seven he began that discussion has had the branches and protect themselves\nAgainst cancer patients by the other branches of government how can the executive protect yourself against the legislature how can the judiciary protect itself against both\nPoints out that there is that he thinks that the real danger in legislative usurpations he says the legislative department derive the puree or you know government from other circumstances it's constitutional powers being at once more extensive unless susceptible to provide limits\nMake candles greater facility math honor complicated in an indirect measure encroachment which make on the coordinate departs\nIn an indirect measures encroachment which make\nOn a coordinate department in other words it because the legislature has more power and give more power under the constitution that gives it more ability to use our power from the other branches he argues the usurpations by the executive and judiciary are unlikely why\nBecause he said as a legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people and hadn't some constitutions will discretion\nAnd it all the prevailing influence over the junior rewards and do to fill the other departments that dependence is created in the latter which gets do greater facility to ... the former in other words the legislature has the power to take away money from the other branches restrict or a section\nWhich shouldn't have to worry about usurpations now there's one problem with the founding vision for how the government was supposed to balance and so\nThe main problem is the perception by the founders that the big problem was going to be ambition right well they tend to ambition was going to counteract ambition which has also said in the federalist papers that\nThe legislators we're going be ambitious they weren't going to stand for the executive encroaching on their power the deck and was going to be ambitious the executive wasn't going to stay in Stanford encroachment on on his or her power same thing in the judiciary\nThe problem in the legislature because of the the regulatory state actually is not ambitious enough the legislature now has an incentive to kick every tough question over either judiciary or executive in other words what we need is in the legislature that attempt you grab back its power whether we're talking in the context of war powers\nAre in the context of environmental regulation across the board the legislature was designed to be the first among equals not the president and not judiciary okay time for a quick on one of the things that I Love about this arms and the reason that they carry over time the reason that they've been crucial to\nReligious people's understanding of God for thousands of years is because it's almost don't sugarcoat things need these homes\nAre deeply in tune with human anguish and need right\nContent as an example of this dark why lord you stand far off while you hide yourself in times of trouble pretty harsh indictment of God right\nWhere where are you one thing that raw is why it's so weird that folks or religious when non religious people say to them well you know how can there be a God when bad things happened in the world but oh you're the first person who thought of this and the question of the odyssey and the first person in history of the thought of that question\nI don't know we have thousands of years of theology discussing this exact issue and the final answer is basically the you aren't God that's basically the answer and that's not always a comforting answer\nWhen did they truly answer that Saddam has has ended their against the wicked man on the on the week or caught in this game you to buy his he boast about the ... the lord and his pride the wicked man did not seek him and all his boss\nThere is no room for got it's interesting how we can folks are characterized not just as people will do other people harm you know hunting down the week but also they're characterized as folks\nWho don't spend any time thinking about that and I think those two things are related then I mean every agent person is bad not by a long shot I think I Know a lot of wonderful at the mall but we never religious person and good bought a horrible horrible religious people but it doesn't mean that\nPeople who genuinely are wiccan including religious people spend very little time thinking about higher morality or what has demanded of the ... and then they're spending a lot of time thinking about what they want his ways are always prosper as your laws are rejected by him he's near as at all his enemy he says himself nothing will ever shake me he's where no one will ever do any harm to the wicked man\nObviously you know king David is suffering from the from it on a pretty rough life\nWhen you when you talk to a religious person your second one even if even if you're not religious you should recognize that religious people do think about the serious problems of life on a daily basis\nThe answer may be different than yours I think it's more inspiring answer and then the second we're after and I think it's also true answer then the second were entered the secular answer is basically we've happened the religious answer as we've happens but that because God is in charge and we don't understand God\nAnd I think that's a fair answer to to the question then simply random chance coming up\nThis week we had on Andrew claim it on our Sunday special it was really a fascinating interesting conversations are really interesting to hear some of that are able to measure Russia\nAnd I needed to get beyond that and I think the thing about another kingdom is it because it works on two levels because it's a very realistic thriller story very gritty becoming more thriller story and also this very ah almost old fashioned medieval fantasy story\nThese two levels in in my own mind talking to one another the fact that I Am a realist ah I Believe that the world is a material world I Believe that everything can be explained through materialism on it every piece of our bodies can you know I could trace every thought in my mind the same time I believe that there is\nA a new middle plane uh that\nUh where the spirit lives and all that our flesh tells a story about a flushes telling a story about the spirit you know and so it actually allowed me to write that without ever widening the Christian ...\nWhat what's your process for writing I mean you said that you do a lot of outlining does that turn it workman like or do you actually sit down and you just kind of wet it's loud\nOnly part of my work I hate the outlining I mean it's boring or it's a you know it's just close work and you just have to sit there and do it there's no excitement no character in it even though I write a lot of biographies for characters and things like that\nHowever if you do that work I've now learned when you sit down to write your free you know you you know the new singing the guy is going to you know run down that hallway and he's going to find such and such and you don't have to sit there\nAnd that hallway and he's going to find such and such and you don't have to sit there and stare at that blank screen which is of course the nightmare every writer\nWriter has so I Do do that I Do a lot of prep work and\nUh it's really helpful and what I tried to do is I Try and do it a little bit every day because it's just focus groups you know I mean it's just the one part of a job I Love my work I I really do love it and then I but it's the one part of the job I just think that I got into this I got to work it out\nSo what's your schedule on a day to day basis because you coming here he unconsciously become here you do your part cat and then you're writing hours and hours a day or how do you first of all how declared the time and taking them all were taken from you wake up you go to bed scheduled during a normal day\nWhile I wake up I wake up at a ... you know five Fifteen five thirty yeah I Know and the first thing I Do I like I said hello to my wife and I grabbed my ... reading the news you know goes on on just catching up on everything\nAnd I do that pretty solidly or until I slept through the show which uh you know on the show by around six thirty plus you know\nAnd uh and then I Do that stop stop for maybe about forty five minutes to do kind of face stuff I read the gospels in in Greek which I'm so proud of our health drinking and uh and then I read some Old Testament some faith you know other other kinds of stuff\nAnd then come in and do the show and then I go home and so I you know and I knew somebody asked me how I got along with no sleep and I told him I take natural other people are expressing their opinions [laughter]\nReally works but um but yeah no I I I just keep going and then I I I'm done by the seven\nOkay well let's go through some of your faith journey because you know the shaping how you're you're seeing the world\nIn terms of your your fiction writing on it and you have a pretty interesting faith during the you and I ended up in very upper hand by that you started off you know born into a Jewish family that I tend to before we had this conversation that you you were born in the next door nearly secular Jewish family my show and and now you are religious questions how do you get from point a to point B\nWhat we're thinking about my family was it was secular but it was also committed to my father at least was committed to the traditions so we went to the Hebrew school we were bar mitzvahed\nOr we learned this stuff but it did occur to me that um I've always had this I won't call it an obsession is a little too much but I've always had this idea that things should make sense if things don't make sense you should change your mind\nAnd and fart about this because of a kind of dysfunctional atmosphere in my house where we were taught a lot of philosophical ideas that were just on true\nAnd and it's very damaging you know 'cause you don't want to tear away from your family but the same time you want to find the truth\nAnd so I became kind of obsessed with finding the truth she's praying and here they're learning Hebrew which is not my language and you know they're wearing you know the hat and the thing you know you think\nWell if there is no God and then my mother was a stone atheist and my father was just kind of like you know he didn't want to even want to get in trouble with God but like he would [laughter] believing in me that and and after ... think well this is ridiculous this is ridiculous so\nAfter my bar mitzvah I mean that was kind of the turning point I was by miss but I got thousands of dollars worth of gifts to put it in this box and Monday I got up through the box with because with everything in it and I just thought like you know ...\n... yeah exactly and we've gotten teams you know this is not what I I Want and I didn't really expected to live my life\nAs a shorter and intellectual agnostic you know like the way I mean I think this kind of was the default position of thinking men in my day you know and it's it's kind of still in that yeah ... now you write and I and I think that was going to be a that was really my position which\nIs very flattering sitting intellectual mind because you can analyze everything into dodged if there's no matter how small the point is you can break it up and to even smaller pieces because you don't have the bottom line of there has to be meaning there has to be morality that has the problem was when I was Nineteen I read crime and punishment\nAnd convince me that\nThe more world exists to convince me that Congress right there was a story sky above the moral all within and that was that was undeniably true and because of that I kept circling around the weirdest this morality and meaning come from\nAnd I'm not I wasn't satisfied with things I hear from you guys like our pal Jordan Peterson\nEither just the Italian philosopher Marcelo ... live as if there were a God\nAnd I think to live as if there were a God is essentially to want\nThe conclusions of the soldiers and who's premises you don't accept it and I notice that such a way again everything had to make sense to me and\nUltimately I mean I had a ... when I was a kid I've lived like these two laws had terrible emotional problems so I had a terrible relationship with my father five my household was\nDysfunctional in this very invisible way but not a lot of violence was not a lot of hatred it was just this kind of invisible dysfunction\nCrackdown came a point when I was like twenty eight years old I just stopped working basically I just like boom if something's wrong\nAnd at that point which was would have been a smart point to seize hold a God like a piece of ... food floating by the ocean\nI felt like that then I'll never bleach because it'll always be this thing I did because I was a week because I was on down on my luck\nBecause I was broken it'll always be this crushed when I see just hold up\nThis issue is how stubborn I was about things making sense you know and uh\nAnd so instead of by the grace of God I by founding shrink cured me and I always laugh about this I'm the only person I've ever known was cured my second [laughter] but he did you know even within the course of like two three years of talking to this guy I was a\nCompletely different human being and it was only then when I felt shame when I felt certain that my impressions were correct when I felt certain that I was living in a delusional life and it seemed\nObvious to me that there was a God because of my moral stance and the stance that if everybody on her it was a time that was a time when everybody on earth believes slavery was right even the slaves that would have said yeah I don't want to be the slave\nBut this is the way things are at that time slavery was wrong and once you say that you're screwed God was I mean you cannot you cannot get away from the idea of it somewhere there is this moral based this base of meaning\nAnd the mission things become fascinating to me now because\nThey've got like you and me who actually believe we're kind of anomalies in the world of the thinking man I think there's a there is right now the world of a thinking man's divided into two on one side and if people like Jordan Peterson Marshall a pair of the bed was Perry who wrote that book the strange death of Europe\nAnd we're ... novel was it was like a little bit who were basically saying the west can survive without the Judeo Christian\nOr she says we should all strive to the Judeo Christian ceases I myself do not believe right all saying the same thing I myself not only from the other side you have these guys like evil Harare and who have savings and Steven Pinker who saying no no no my friends\nYou know we we're going off in the open up this has been an absolute\n... actually on it and then pick or I mean I think that this whole routine where\nEnlightenment will say lots and everything is going to continue as they get better and he's like ... away the foundations Washington was Asian nothing will will crumble and Harare making like well maybe a couple of nations in the first place I mean I kind of having an ill and we're happy or when they're eating grass and and all that kind of ... and at least at least you got it that way\nAnd he has this kind of Vulcan idea that we're all living in a delusion\nOn it that way and he has this kind of woke an idea that we're all living in a delusion like he's ... the problem with him as he says the most unique his phrase I Would never say the most unique but he does is the most unique thing about sapiens is the fictions we create so we have a fiction that there's a God we have a fiction the way of human rights\nFor fiction money money has rallies or the national health fiction works I mean ... describes something it does not create things I can I can create a delusional world through fiction but good fiction\nCreates describes reality so money is a good example money and describes the value of something to a human being when he has a lot of it or when he doesn't have a lot of it that's what it describes you know I was actually\nIt actually does have a value that were accepting the paper doesn't but the idea does and because ... who doesn't accept that there is a human life that matters um he thinks it's all being created by sections but the functions are being created by that internal life", "show_name": "Questions & Answers", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "27"}
