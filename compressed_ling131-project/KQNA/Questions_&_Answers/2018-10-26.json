and the phone lines I won't be the day you know like Texas\nDoctor but that said\nWe got a baseball game tonight we kind of got a football game on Sunday you and I are both going to be at\nThat when you mean the diamond backs are playing and I know diamond\nBacks what went on to curl or the show though even though it's not something we warn people month ago\nWhen the ... and it was even a month ago but no matter who were National League you make that\nThey're probably going to run into some problem 'cause some of the American league\nLook awfully good to get the red Sox beat the Yankees the Cleveland be here than it was going to be tough for any National League team especially with our home field advantage\nTo do something now so far Boston on horses up two games or nothing but we saw a lot of World Series included on back several one weren't home teams can win it off dogs can turn around and went all three even though it's pretty top national debt that naturally down a little bit this year American League which really tough but it's not over\nCourse tonight's a huge game for the Dodgers a lot of pressure on a rookie\nBut the other thing could go back to Boston Boston would then have to do like the diamond backs and potentially have to win game six and seven over there but they do have that home field advantage and we saw where it may kind of a big difference especially in game on and even a game to\nRed Sox fan at five and nine of the first pitch\nWe will keep going on everything I Will give you the line up here and a second 'cause I'm going to like take a parts of the not the cause is take a pause\nSo dark and throw some stuff out there 'cause he's probably dying to get something besides ... interview that we're going to have some time between now and six cars ... and actually again tomorrow night got a couple of home games are starting to look better and better but dock\nWhat do you have for this weekend what am I missed what do you what do you want a preview I Know there's a whole bunch of ... games are going to get to some of those too but where do you want to chat about this weekend on Tonight Show\nIn the beginning of his postseason career you and I were there when he finally won a big game and he goes against Atlanta no why and you know I don't think it was one of us with somebody else did you get a monkey off your back in and ready I expect him to say something stupid or whatever we know he went with it you know I gotta go real off my back\nAnd that I remember the\nPrice has got to be saying the same thing finally picking up a World Series win and then the playoff when a week ago or so to that guy was home when nine with a ... hour a it was just terrible so he's still got a long way to go he can be pitcher for the rest of his life and they'll never be Curt Schilling or even\nWhat Randy ended up doing to the meantime backed out great Curt Schilling is due to Lebanon to should be probably fourteen into all the bloody sock the three rings\nOr this is the guy that knows how to get it done and yeah I might give them a home run but usually Hope Solo homerun doesn't matter but he is a guy that gets done through the years\nThrough the season and into the playoffs I'm Sorry Mr ... you cannot say that you get it done in a regular season just fine but when it comes to the playoffs nine nine for something ER re\nDoes not cut it\nWhere Curt Schilling ... statistics cut it and the bloody stock thing like you said it's true and this is the guy who went out there\nCould have crippled themself riding in you know on the car looking at all the red Sox fans and all of this and that's one I think he finally decided game time decision that he was going to pitch that game and he pitched a great game so Curt Schilling\nShould be a statue of him joined there should be one of ... in this town but a\nThank you for bringing that up to us with doctors just tuned in to the red Sox did not invite Kurt or kind of didn't too you know the big celebration for game one and then kind of didn't they just didn't wow\nNot cool not noble purge should be there he probably has more to do with them winning those World Series is then big Papi and I've seen a lot then Pedro Martinez and I'll tell you what I've got I just found a picture of it myself I was in the locker room\nAfter they clinched I Want to say it was a St Louis you or they're too old for the clinch and even though Pedro incurred had their differences\nThey were in the kind of the shower area there was just off limits to us but I could see it with an embrace in a hug kind of like hey do let bygones be bygones world chance we got this done I took a picture of it with my crappy little camera and I remember waving some of the sports illustrated guys over like dude here's your shock\nHere's your money ... get a picture of this\nAnd I think they missed it by the time they got over there but Curt Schilling did more than Pedro did more than or cheese for that team to be able to win the old for and the next World Series and\nNow when it comes a diamond backs\nEqually as important I think as what Randy did in that one\nAnd some of the other may be offensive player is I'm not sure how great guns or was throughout the whole series because he was hurt us scrap along yeah he got the hit in the end but it was a blooper so to me and they won the NBA ... it was perfect but\nThere was my answer that anybody to answer it took the co MVP chilling Randy Johnson I agree with that\nI don't know who won it in Boston but the MVP should have gone to Curt Schilling probably both of those years especially when you look at the whole body of work for the play\nOh man you won your God or Manny Ramirez remember the ... but you know you're right and then I just I'm just looking at some quick steps like when he was a Philadelphia there was two seasons they are over three hundred strike outs and then when he was here with the Diamondbacks\nIn two thousand and two actually the year after year three hundred and sixteen strike outs for the year and the year we won the world series to Ninety three ...\nThree thousand one hundred and sixteenth strike outs for a twenty year career is just phenomenal and I don't know it just oh I'm so glad you agree with me because when I when I was reading all that stuff I just couldn't believe\nThat they would do that to them and and I don't think of people made that much about it I I don't really remember seeing anything on ESPN about they probably don't want to talk about Curt and I saw a couple of little articles and I go see him in his whole family sent out some\nTweak things and I'm so disappointed they were and what have you which I don't blame them for doing that but anyway a filling out a\nGreat career big game pitcher and uh he he was really like you said Cohen BPA and receipts and responsible in many ways for the diamond backs two thousand and one World Series championship\nIn the meantime I'm not just Keith Olbermann was hired but you know I've talked about Alex Rodriguez\nIs hard his his landed a couple of gigs with ESPN ... you know the it on a pre game thing beat the Sunday night baseball and I understand the ratings are down in possibly because of that a lot of people time that they're not happy with him just like there now with people that needle in football games and things like that\nAnd a ride makes a lot of mistakes and I mean I Know I Do an acronym pronounce people all the time but I'm not on ESPN Sunday night baseball he he mispronounce there's a lot of the normal he was calling bud black\nBudget bell the other day and he ... he missed pronounces a lot of the players that he's doing there on Sunday night baseball and then the other thing is not only did they get rid of Curt shilling for a ride but they hired\nAnd I'm all for women's rights in hiring lady but the lady that they have on there what's your name and does a she's a women's softball pitcher in college so I mean what is that got to do with major league baseball and she actually does okay\nI'm Sorry Curt Schilling knows more about baseball and one little finger then this gal does you know for whole career you know being\nYou are then this gal does you know for her whole career you know being a softball player in college and I did see her in the celebrity game and I wasn't even impressive there I Would much rather have Ginny finch there is a gallery complacent softball and place them probably could hit a baseball on top of it all but\nHer children should have a job somewhere if you wanted it and it is in the meantime the Arab world and women's soccer ball players\nGet jobs and he gets fired because God Forbid he said something that somebody didn't like so crazy stuff and oh\nI don't know about crazier but we have a lot going on this week and we got interviews coming up a loop Lipinski a couple of the things I didn't mention about this weekend you've got\nAnother good local football game I mean just mountain is coming to Prescott they're both seven into so if you're looking for something to do outside beautiful weather this week in great falls callers beautiful\nVenue they're at Prescott high maintenance coming in at seven into to play Prescott high was also Seventy seven o'clock kicked off and they were looking for some warm weather stuff to do\nArizona fall league baseball has started it's been started a couple of weeks ago in fact some of the guys out of senior softball we're talking about heading down and check it out some games basically I think Sundays they get the day off but if you're looking for a day game twelve thirty five first pitch the it down and Peoria surprise\nSalt river all these places are on the north side of Phoenix you can scoot on down it's seven bucks I don't know maybe last you know maybe this senior discount but check it out see all the stars of tomorrow type of thing so there is baseball was wooden bats going on\nIn the valley ... and I love going out to those are gonna try to go before they they you know it seems like every time we want to go all of a sudden the season's over it it only lasts a couple of months and\nBoom before you know what it's gone and dark I don't know if you notice\nThe Tampa Bay rays oh one of these American League teams that are really good and I think one Ninety maybe Ninety two games I think it was at least Ninety but didn't make the play offs probably\nCame close the first place in the national league in most places but they are they came in third in the American way beyond the Yankees and the red Sox I don't know if they've got any coaches left did you notice the twins and the blue jays scooped up a couple of their\nTheir their coaching staff so to speak to their managers yeah and I was really young I think it was only thirty seven years old\nYeah Rocco up all deli in fact I heard a funny story somebody happens to have his old cell phone number and I think it's a lady and she you know she said something light to some reporter well I guess ... got a new job because she got all these tax\nYou know to his old number that people don't know is you know been updated 'cause he wasn't changed it but anyways Rocco about LA is now the twins manager and he was the\nI Believe the ... to do was hitting instructor\nI'm thirty seven years old like you said he's replacing the old timer Palmolive through which\nYou know to us ... great hall of fame or you know all that but you're sixty two and a lot of players can't really relate to somebody like that and didn't even know really who he was you know of course twins people figured it out after a while but a lot of people don't even know Palmolive sure is a Saturday and it wasn't any manager of the year a couple of years back though yeah well it's like the kiss of death\nAnd all of L. O. and he almost got ... well that was on the hot seat for next year and he was married to the record gives those ... you see what you mean matter to the year and then within a year or two you're fired\nAnd yeah yeah ... did a good job over there in Minnesota and and like spark he always said\nYou know I go from being a genius to stupid the next year I think the players you know\nSo uh you know there was some problems with the players are having the right guys on the field and you know they weren't good enough and so anyways Palmolive tourist fire thirty seven year old ... comes in Tampa Bay rays you is the assistant coach I'm\nEvers at third Jackie brightly junior center field betting seven and the good thing about that is\nThis guy covers a lot of ground so there was a ... Martinez he'll back him up you know the good thing about being left field that right field if you don't have a good arm\nIt's not as important in left field you your throat estate third base is not very far compared to right field so it is much more important to have a great arm in right field\nSo J. D. and laugh is a good place to put on a will you be protected really see any pictures with Brock whole Betty Brock needs to get the job done to ... get some pitches so back to the lineup Jackie Bradley junior ... happened to her field or the the Red Sox have like three catchers and they seem to be re rotating them and their none of them are great\nOffensively but Vasquez is doing the catching tonight and betting eight and then report sell on the mound\nVery underrated this guy was like Seventeen and seven so you know not not a bad choice there and no you know we'll see what the Red Sox and get done and they got done you know they got the job done with price despite his terrible playoff record so we'll see if we are still get a job there was a devastating right handed pitching a left handed pitching\nThe auditors don't necessarily do great offensively against ... but their defense\nWhen they bring in their right hand it bad tend to be a better defensive team so far the other\nBad tend to be a better defensive team\nSo far the there there is a better way better any team though that when those guys are sitting there is some\n... every one of them has like over twenty home run so that's been the debate today Roberts throw away the platoon stuff\nAnd you know because it isn't like Kiki Hernandez ripping the cover off the ball and uh that's what I find interesting because now there'll be loaded up\nWith their left handed power guys that have been basically sitting on the bench until like the seventh or eighth inning when they get to pinch hit so I think that takes away the Dodgers game is home runs whereas the red Sox can get to home runs and ... and whatever they're up and down their line up\nAnd they have this phenomenal quality which we don't see in Arizona but they score so many runs after two outs it's been amazing I think of that which is a step nine out of the third team runs or no they had twelve\nTwelve runs so nine out of the twelve runs in this World Series of come after two outs I'll tell you when games\nOr one where it's that these two teams against right handed starters Red Sox are like plus fifty they're like Ninety wins in forty losses Dodgers are like sixty wins fifty lost and found the exact number they don't have right in front of me I looked at it earlier today\nBut uh the Dodgers don't necessarily do that great granted\nThey didn't they weren't that high over five hundred anyway so I mean that's left is probably pretty similar so uh you know we'll see one thing is again on defense the guys they got in there a better defend the defense of players\nSo uh we'll see how that plays out but you're right they got home runs up and down that line of one complain and he's not playing today is does your second base\nThis the guy who can still get the home runs is he's a well liked player did a great job in Minnesota but his range is aging as range are declining of his age is going up in his range is declining a lotta people appointed to a couple of plays in game one where\nA Chris Taylor who is playing second base today or you mentioned Kiki Hernandez would've may be may be at a play the attorney double play and there was a lot of those close calls that led to chew out the red Sox have done very well with two outs and scored a lot of runs in some of those were\nAn inch a game of inches there were an inch to being safer out and a lot of people thought\nThat a different second baseman than does or could have gotten the job done we'll see we'll see tonight as Chris Taylor is in there if that makes any difference of course they come back home to Los Angeles it's whether it's warmer not a hundred and three degrees\nLike last year at this time when they opened in Los Angeles but surely won't be fifty degrees like it is and Fenway Park also all the shadows could play a part this is a five o nine start so they can see it at eight or nine back east and seven and nine and central\nSo there's some shadows of course the ball does carry a little bit better during the day and this is almost daytime in Los Angeles but the shadows can make up for so the over under seven and a half\nAnd run in eight and a half\nDon't know you know what to tell ya now I'll tell you this Las Vegas batters and I still got to get to the doctors line up\nThis game openness LA uh favorite a minus one sixty which means or by one and a half to one favorite to win this while the batters are back now\nAnd it's up to a minus one eighty so people are betting pretty big Los Angeles it'd be tempting to take the red Sox going back to my philosophy that anybody in the American league is going to kick the national league's bug and these guys are just going to get it done but\nI I'm not put any money on this one that we're just talking baseball and I'm staying away from it even sitting in a bedroom window if anything I might take Boston you know as it is it big underdog if it was a pick them no way this this is anybody's game tonight I'm not sure if I agree with the Dodgers being almost two to one favorite but this is the line at the doctors were running out there\nAnd it's one that I think you you're saying you like the for the ... the one reason I Would like there's a Dodger fan as their their defense of defense is probably better with these guys in there except for maybe a catching 'cause bring it over and I was honestly that ... yeah all machine\nBut as you mentioned Roberts is quick to give somebody a hook\nAnd bring in somebody else for righty left to be for defense but for the Dodgers today\n... Peterson is going to be leading often play in left field\nElectric time Justin Turner will be banning second and playing third and this is the guy who's got talk about Curt showing in his pitching numbers this is a guy who's got some great playoff number some of the best\nI Believe is bearing average just close to five hundred and all this playoff games I Know it's in the mid for hundreds but ... and he got a few here from game on adjusting turn will be the second plane third Mac Muncie is in there the a\nKind of a ... you know the the surprise home runs star the betting third and playing first saw many Machado will be betting forwards and playing shortstop great player but a thug a Cody ... won't be booted leaves will be the first time will be moved for a feel for a while because he's been getting boot and\nEverywhere else that he's been but a Coney Ballenger will be batting fifth and in way way way way way too who's getting mood\nManny Machado\nYou all to tonight but he's been ... Cody bill injured doesn't get the no ... no it was many Machado week I got to buy you some cue tips many Machado where I got to speak their many Machado will be back and forth plan short and he won't be food\nIn this particular thing you know he's been getting right along the way I don't see what you're saying ... baton fifth in centerfield tweak that insects in right field\nAnd it's interesting with ... is this year his splits his numbers are a lot better against right handed pitching many left like two hundred against last season three hundred games right he's so\nCrazy ... bat and six and a commanding right field grand Dell is catching inventing seventh and this guy has been just a nightmare for Dodger fans and Dave Roberts and it's\nIt's as if you think he's got ... disease but as a catcher\nBut there had to bring your backup in and they've been stealing off the phone but this guy's been passed balls not saving wild pitches he can't even seem to we laugh about this whenever there's like a check swing he always has\nTo do the wrong on power you know was that as well but that's just that's just him being maybe these stupid I don't ... about his batting average just seemed like he strikes a whole if every time when he's up there\nWell that's one of the nightmares the red Sox have believe it or not our the Dodgers you mentioned live and die by the home run sales strike out a lot the red Sox as much as they've got\nGreat off and it's and they get their share of home runs they don't strike out\nAnywhere near as much as almost any team in the major leagues issue what you're saying a lot 'cause everybody's strikes out nowadays in the major leagues so that's one thing that they felt in game one would give her shawl problem\nIs he wasn't going to bail maybe strike out as many guys 'cause the red Sox can you know they can play a nationally ball they can get ... movie along you saw some stolen bases\nAnd we'll see if they're gonna steal bases against grand del as they've been doing in the past ... seven today catching Chris Taylor\nVery versatile very good player he'll be playing second base and betting case and then walk her view as a rookie who's really good pitcher and has been getting it down but now it's game three of the world series granted luckily he's at home which makes it a little bit easier but he'll be on the mound\nHe's at home which makes it a little bit easier but he'll be on the mound up for the Dodgers tonight in the five o nine first pitch so your thoughts on expand some more on the line up what do you think who you like in this game do you think that doctors should be a minus one eighty almost a two to one favorite well we'll\nWe'll see if they maybe they'll heat up their bodies because I could tell they didn't really like the cold weather in their bats\nWill eat up at the same time it's so hard to say but I Do like these left hander is in there I was just kind of rushing through like Jack Peterson a twenty five home runs I'm pretty sure that the months he was in the thirties for the season as far as\nHitting home runs to a Cody Ballenger\nLet's see what he Cody had twenty five home runs too so well they don't have those guys in there they're like Ninety year old ... home runs sitting on the bench but he has money makes me nervous and his backup\nBars ... who is an ASU kid he was a second baseman they made him into a", "show_name": "Questions & Answers", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "26"}
