goodness\nAnd uh I understand what the temperatures are going to be in the seventies this weekend I'm Down with that beautiful weather here are absolutely Dave ... who was a public information a director officer\nFor a you have a county Missouri You brought some special gift and they told me who you brought\nWell thank you for having us or I brought to people as I usually do across the table for me to David Williams who is our development services director\nUh he's the one that if you knew or health permit to build you in the in the county you go see him and his department they'll take care of you and he has he brought a special guests to brought a new you know many many over there is no matter who is in the in the room and next to me is sharing with men who is the community health center or the ... director\nUh many people don't realize that the county has a clinic or a doctor's office\nWith pediatricians and a dental temperamental and behavior I'll have to have her health that's right um so all kinds of great medical services to the county is offering 'em to those with insurance without it is a great service or we're gonna talk a little bit about that today All right where do you want to start\nWe'll start with Sharon ... has everybody had their flu shot\nI Can't speak for everyone in around where I have I I\nI didn't raise your hand or a flu shot flu shot\nBut there's no way am I going to go on our eye ... eye up Allison and nobody's going to ensure that others\nAre [laughter] well they're counting does take care for ah getting flu shots are those who walk and you know\nWe do both through the clinic and public health\nSo public health I Believe you can walk in there and she was ... even as a public information I mean ... and we of course are always assessing patients so we'll make sure you get your flu shot either with payment through your insurance or sliding fee scale\nOr a ... kind of a bigger picture what it is that your office has a responsibility for\nI don't think a lot of people realize that like David said the county actually has a health clinic and not only a health clinic where a federally qualified health center meaning we receive what's called section three thirty federal funds and we've had those since two thousand and two\nAnd it helps us to provide services on a sliding fee scale to those that can't afford it\nBut we accept all insurance and a lot of very Reno insurance only if you have Medicare managed care let her know all of those any private yeah United healthcare Blue Cross Blue Shield um counties city um the VA will accept it and they'll it\nAnd a huge misconception that somehow maybe substandard care not at all to get our federal funds we have quality majors and we have to be expected to perform or they can take away our many\nMoon and these are all local doctors these guys moved here because they love the area they're they're dedicated professionals um board certified many of them all in all of them\nMust have been hints of the different David it's very clear David Williams is the director of a developing services so if you build a house or building with in the county or outside of the incorporated Prescott whenever a you're going to meet his lovely and talented staff\nOr when you submit your permits or or your plans to get permits um and so we're talking today about that whole process\nYeah I from what I can see just Mandarin around our county you must be pretty busy\nWe are extremely busy right now\nI'm you know our permit activity is through the roof or we see that's a that's a that's a it is a rough it it has a literal arose yeah literally is literally thankfully it's going the right way it's not falling through the room\nBut ah no or permanent activities are just sky rocketed we did last year we had a twenty two ... believe it was a Twenty one percent increase over a two thousand sixteen that's what we did in Seventeen\nWe're on track to do twenty six percent increase this year again\nSo we went from thirty six hundred permits in two thousand Seventeen to approximately forty six hundred this year a showing no signs of slowing down at all\nAre these are these balance a or in the throughout the county or or one area seems to be concentrated no\nWe really see the big growth areas that we have 'em in the ... valley antelope meadows a springs just north of Prescott valley um all the way out to the mountain at a legend hills okay on your way out to Iran there and in Williamson valley especially we see a lot of activity there\nUh but over in constant when we see a tremendous amount of activity as well village of Oak Creek is a booming right now a lot of houses being built up their red rock on the other side we've got a a just a lot of a renewed interest in areas we didn't have any interest in a few years ago\nAnd I have to assume this is partly because of the economy the economy doing well people were employed they've got money to build and having gone through the bill process it's it's not always the easiest thing and so it's good to have somebody like Dave who cares and wants to get people through this process\nBut how long has it taken from a request to saying go ahead hit that permit\nSo this is one of the things I'm most proud of fighting took over as director or a year ago actually a little less than a year ago and her turnaround times I'll be very honest they were atrocious\nWe were running seven to eight weeks to get your first review on a house plan a which in my mind is just unacceptable in the industry and that was really a byproduct of just a a backlog a staff we got hit with a wave of a new homes were unable to react quickly enough to try to address those\nAnd where we're at today and I'm extremely proud of this where it two weeks turnaround time which is ahead of the industry standard right now\nSo on our Prescott office work just under two weeks and cotton wood we're about two and a half to three weeks or just because we lost some staff or had a fantastic staff member that I'll say it unfortunately city of Prescott stole him away from white because of the economy was opportunity for him to move up we're real happy for them when they are\nBut um you know we've got a new person coming on board over there so I expect those numbers to come back down and get under that two week number but but that's not good enough\nI'm I I'm always looking for ways to improve what we do and one of the initiatives we've got right now is an entirely new digital computer permitting system\nSo the antiquated system is slowly but surely has become antiquated\nIt has our our our current software system is Twenty years old a it was probably ten years old when we bought it so uh back before we all had cellular telephones running around this thing or you know came to light so\nWe chased plans around the building right now they come in they got to go from person to person to run your hobbies\nAre new system called citizens or should be on line about April ... is what we're expecting and what we're I'm anticipating what that is it's going to streamline the entire process in that timeframe down even more\nAre now or ... or when we get that up and running when the plans come in they'll be sent to all of the reviewers simultaneously people will be able to apply for permits from the comfort of their couch while they're eating dinner or just get on their their computer and blow it and take care of all of that there will be able to request inspections\nOr through the online permitting up hurdles and it's really going to streamline everything our inspectors are going to go to tablets in the field so we'll be able to reduce the paper cost um that is one of those are hitting numbers in a building a house\nOr they won't have to pay that anymore you know we're we're going to cut out\nThe way you're trying it sounds like you know the old truck driver sit at home or build a house but how about the contractors and the guys that are you know building a whole subdivisions to the same service avail\nServices are across the board so it's really going to be able to help them out the which means Costco down these costs go down and\nPlanning that goes ahead absolutely so the process move quicker easier for the builder or the homeowner as well as they've department now can they still submit paper plans\nThey will still be able to submit paper plans were going to have staff available to digitize them a show even as we go through that process I'm going to make sure we get them into that digital format if they're not able to do it at home or they're not able to go to one of the the ... per graphic companies and have them scan will take care of that for them\nYou know we're talking about building homes what about somebody that has um a new septic tank they need to put into that come through Europe is\nThat'll come through our office is well we have the department consist of the environmental unit which takes care of those waste water systems planning a land use which is our code enforcement building safety permitting\nA plan review we've got address in there as well and that pretty much I I like to say if you build it above ground or below ground we are going to be involved\nI that's that's scary well in early what they're doing is making sure that is being done right it's not just because\nMaking sure that is being done right it's not just because we want to be a hassle I mean I I Know you don't want to be ... um I always think of you know you you think of the the little old lady that is building a house and doesn't really know much about her she's hire a contractor well\nDave is going to make sure that the contract to rebuild that right well you know one of the programs we run here of course is the you have a pi county contracts association you\nMust have worked pretty close with them we do we really do um we're constantly in communication with them on different topics were working right now hand in hand actually on a coordinated code adoption for the two thousand and Eighteen building codes and the Y. C. C. A. is helping everybody coordinate this show that\nUh come hopefully July one is our target date\nAll the municipalities and county ... county we'll all go live on a brand new coach at one time and it's everybody's makes the same language everybody speaking the same language and more importantly we're speaking the same dialect\nBecause right now because the College of always been looked at an individual will will calling silos\nUh Prescott had their coats and their tweaks to those ... we had ours in Prescott valley had theirs\nAnd it just created a a regulatory nightmare for the contractors\nThey weren't able to um easily submit plans and use the same plans that they submitted to us at the county and use those same lines in Prescott valley we're trying to get everybody on the same page um it's for all that efficiency and and really just reducing regulation where we can\n... it really makes it a lot easier for the builders are ... that are building because now everybody is using the same code is the most recent code um my father in law built built into them and he told me one of the issues that he's had is he knows that this technology works in building you know whatever it is and the Smith foundations whatever\nBut because this ... you know a county or whatever uses an older code that doesn't accept that technology that technique he comes to a halt exactly you can't use is now he's got to do something else so now with everybody on the same code the most recent up to date code it just makes it so much easier\nFor everybody and get one of the things that I see that not the kind of goes to me with this is the fact that\nThe people who supplied the that the materials\nAnd the contractor now can order and based upon the schedule that you're making available to them they can order their product whether it's a frames or or drywall or brick or whatever\nAnd so everything's more efficient Robin saying well we ordered a whole truckload of trust us but\nWe can't get them so you have to you have to wait another two weeks you know in in this way everybody was kind of working together so they have a product that everybody can say we're on time right on and on budget\nWith this new system if you've you know that you need to call for this particular next inspection you can just go online and in order it and they'll tell you when they're going to come out and it just it just really streamlining the complicated process\nWe're going to take up a commercial break here and just a little bit but Mr Williams how what got you into this field 'cause I'm going I'm going to ask her\nWell you know real estate was a family business growing up and that's just kind of became a natural ... what are you from Syria I I'm actually from the valley uh my parents lived up here for a boy I Believe we're at Fifteen Years and you know so we we always were up here visiting and\nDue to the economy I was finally able to escape the Phoenix area I don't get out in the metro area and bring the family up here five years ago and we loved it ever since\nAnd I'm Glad that you are enjoying it here because it sounds to me like you've got the plan that's going to make it a lot easier for everybody I Try and learn to take time out to be back with a more on a Thursday roundtable after uh the catch up on the news and hopefully it's all good news out there huh [laughter]\nYes come see come see us rehab navigator what I call them and I think that's a term I don't hear it as my ...\nThe course of the U.S will ever gators don't actually do applications where these lovely people will actually walk you through the application process and it's amazingly helpful because ... applying for insurance really is really complicated\nAnd if your income is above I think it's a hundred and fifty percent of the federal poverty level than you would order that is whatever that it'll bring it on every or yeah or then you apply for marketplace insurance if\nIs below that I kind of getting around about this but there are I'm sure there's lots of families out there just struggling to get by and one of the things they have to put off his health care and we don't have to do that\nWe don't and Arizona is a Medicaid expansion state so if there is a need for access you know if you're living it you think it's a hundred and I think it's a hundred ... a hundred percent um are are are certified application counselors can help you apply for that as well\nAnd I don't know if you are not a vaguely don't yeah I was saying that in the last thing\nAnd you can basically walk in and they ask you for a little bit of information like where is your how many people in our household um what's your income and the reason they're doing this because they want to know which way to go if you're at or above that one twenty a field and they put you in the marketplace application if you're below with the help you through the access publications and access a Medicaid you can actually apply for all year\nAnd access a Medicaid you can actually apply for all year it's just a marketplace insurance you have to apply with in the open enrollment humor is yeah well it's\nSix weeks six week no one had December fifteenth oh okay because if you haven't fly by December fifteenth you're out of lifestyle next year\nUnless you have what's called ... events which means you have lost insurance or something changes are so they're always ...\nDum dum dum dum because in you know in all seriousness there's some ... emergencies happenings up of a trend where where where people go to talk to some of your your certified\nAverage person ... any of our clinics came right before as was mentioned making ten Ninety commerce drive in Prescott thirty to twelve north when song drive in Prescott valley fifty one Brian Mickelson parkway and cut and what\nWhat have I not asked you you want to talk about\nHow about our quality award\nNow I realize we are almost through the tenth month as a two thousand eight teams over two thousand Seventeen [laughter]\nYes it almost Halloween and you might want to make an appointment on Halloween the staff of the the why do get a little carried away like classes and\nUm I don't but they do and it it it's kind of fun\nBut um her that um the federal government they look at our quality majors and last year we were a quality award winner and they do that annually so of course we're hoping to be\nEquality award winner again and that's um based on our measurements like you know how do we take care of our diabetics are we routinely dealing in a one see are we doing but sex\nAre people getting in the United nations are they getting\nOur people you're talking to my patients are getting or should or shouldn't and they've actually got a really great ratio of patience to providers are so it's not that difficult to get an appointment\nIt's not we also strive for it for the quality piece you know health care has changed and\nYou do need to see quite a few people every hour but we don't want our providers seeing more than three people in our we'd like them to hit about two and a half to three biggest quality starts to suffer\nYou know and one of the things that are no doctors and caregivers one is Fifteen twenty minutes to talk to somebody uh and and trying to find out how are you feeling which you know and and find out if there are some underlying issues that maybe it's not just the fact that I hurt my arm\nYou find out how why sometimes it's kinda scary\nIt can be scary and sometimes those probing questions bring up other things that are going\nOn where you don't want that you don't want that a little we'll term so fast that the carrier doesn't have time to kind of find out\nRight we have to keep people going through at a rate but if you're a food editor twenty minutes you can usually yes\nBut do you want to go to yeah you don't have twenty people in our\nYou know we do have an hour for each provider per day that's ten minute visit and it and one of those people that we have relationships with as an established patient and you know when you have flu cold\nYou know I hate to admit it but I don't come in and say I needed the pac ... you know we we don't want people\nDictating to their physician but if you're an established patient and you're running a fever and you have a source strep throat and he had a strategy has\nThe ten minute visits do it and you don't want to be there twenty minutes if if you're if the acute as it and you're not feeling well you wouldn't have to follow up type of thing and send you on your way\nEspecially during the allergies and well everybody that walks through is going to be asked have you had your flu shot do you want a flu shot and then in those visits are going to ask our our how're you doing I'm feeling I pressed because that can lead to a lot of\nOpen doors and what is your brain threshold right now sure these are questions at the doctors are going to ask because they have the time you know you go in there for your flu shot is going to be going out and you're done but if it's a regular annual visit are going to spend more and especially the first time does it yeah so that's where she lives with\nMy mom comes in with the kid's mom and dad can remember because you want to talk talk about the whole family situation and the ... and\n... we have um we have reproductive health so a lot of women's health needs are met in our office\nTo the world but ... I'm going to take a timeout before uh before he goes on about the uh the the breast cancer a screen that's something sort of special you're going on right now\nWell we do have the well woman health care program in our office so women who can't afford to have a mammogram we can access funds to pay for that and then we have treatment dollar as well\nSo that's that's kind of an important issue this and the doors behind the women that they have actually helped diagnose and get treatment probably save their lives are newer us All right we'll take your time out the back\nWith more on a Thursday roundtable kinky when a eleven thirty AM Ninety nine point nine FM Ninety five point five FM proceed belly cotton wood and around the world today dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nAnd this moment who has your back you know the name of your insurance agent didn't know what your name or would you call one eight hundred number that connects you to another state another country get a local independent insurance agent with auto owners assurance someone you can call when that stuff happens\nAnd this moment to get an agent who will protect you in that moment hello this is a little more\nThat age in a chair at ... ... four hundred and white tomorrow we're one of the only locally owned and operated independent insurance agent you let the rocket [noise]\n[noise] are you\nLooking for the perfect place to get to your printing done whether it's ... precious family photos old vinyl graphics ... truck Amy reef graphics has you've covered at your local one stop shop\nHaving seven dollars an hour is that enough as a Fifteen Years a customer services on power allows us to take care of us I still passed so unprofessional printing Joe from ... to ... invite any graphics one stop print shop [noise]\nThe antioxidants and we'll just Concord grape juice aren't just anti accidents nah they hate us today will ... tracked down those nasty oxygen and\nFind their leader and beat it towards nibbling Oxford in pole in front of all the other accidents so they link away like scared puppies and you never have to worry about them ever again\nThat well to the antioxidants the world's ...
