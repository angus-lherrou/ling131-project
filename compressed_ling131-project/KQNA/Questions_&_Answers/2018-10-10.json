the town I K Q and a and Robert you're here to introduce our very first guest\nThank your shirt good afternoon everyone our first a gift from compost recovery center and we'd have more rain Michael representing compounds recovered center welcome to show 'em before we get into all the good stuff that was a little bit about yourself sure why not\nLocal here in Prescott, Arizona and I am and personal recovery and I went to school and got my bachelor's in my masters because I really wanted to get back to the community and I wanted to help others with addictions and so\nWe're a small family owned um operation at my husband and my brother in law and I and\nWe have Prescott deer in our heart and we wanted to do things the right way you know for a few years it wasn't great here and press get with some of the recovery communities and and we have set out to change that and to make it a an ethical operation and help those that really need it\nThat is wonderful News I'm always inspired when I hear folks that are living their dream and wanting to give back and that sounds awesome that's what you're in line to do right now\nAbsolutely I'm very passionate about that because you know addiction took over my life and and I didn't know what to do and and then once I got into recovery\nI knew immediately I needed to to be of service and to help others and and so that's what I'm doing and it's amazing well congratulations thank you so tell us a little bit about a couple of recovery center sure so we're a small ... facility here in Prescott and what's different about our facility is that people don't have to live in a separate living home\nTo come to us they can keep their job they can keep staying at home and it's a true I up you'd center where they can come in to get to counseling and the services that they need we treat all addictions including gambling addiction so we're the only one in Prescott that treats gambling addiction okay and um which is you know\nBecoming a problem especially with our local casinos and I'm with I'm afraid of us are so many of them yet but you know everywhere everywhere in Arizona and\nUm and we can individualize treatment plan they can come just to individuals without that they just want a counselor or if they want to do some group I'm so we cater to each client as they walk through the door and being a small family owned facility we can do that so we can we can make sure that everyone gets the right treatment\nDo you also have do you get a lot of referrals or you know it seems to me that when people are are in need they don't necessarily know where to go or how to ask for help um so do you work with referrals to or how does that how does that work we do we work\nWith some referrals as far as like a residential treatment centers and then they come to us for after care we work with some doctors some lawyers if someone gets into trouble with their pets um addiction and so we can hopefully help them keep out of\nPrison or jail by coming and doing some counseling and then it just kind of word of mouth you know in our local community um we're pretty well known in the community um for being an ethical place and so um people do care about us and then we'll send families and\nEven if someone comes to me and I can't play them and I can't help them I Will stay with them until I get them to the facility that will needs for the metro referral service right there absolutely a hundred percent we do free consultations free assessments if someone struggling\nWith any mental health whether it's addiction or not and they call us we're going to help them we're going to assess them and then we're going to\nGive him a plan like maybe this other place would be better for you or maybe just the individual therapists we'd be best for you and and we work with that climate until we can get them placed\nNow Murray and I know you mentioned that you handle all addictions but what about ages Eighteen and up Eighteen and apples and we don't handle adolescent Eighteen and over and right now our client base is anywhere from twenty to fifty eight fifty nine\nSo all ages is an individual and group or how how does that look so we have groups or five days a week and someone can go to one group or five groups and then we also have to individual sessions what's one on one with a counselor and those are one to three times a week depending on what someone needs we also have a\nThat's in a few weeks that isn't a few weeks and I think some of our one of our volunteers is going to be\nI mean I don't think to volunteers you're out of them over to to touch Mari don't worry Robert they're gonna keep volunteering at the changes that have said no doubt that America up picking them up and if they're late it's our fault [laughter] I Love it and so when the grand lodge opens\nWe're going to have an independent living and they're they're big beautiful condo style homes are ranging ... square foot from seven hundred square feet is a studio rain all the way up to a couple of ... which are almost two thousand square feet so we have a different price points are different sizes are for all the folks out there\nWell what I mean and they're beautiful lay out to the the decor very nicely I mean it's it's it's tough match\nIt really is the touch mark has a long history a company that's been around for thirty five years this is our only location in Arizona but we have a twelve other locations and are currently expanding into McKinney, Texas outside of Dallas\nAnd so there's a long history of this company draws upon the founder of the company actually I went to ASU for his masters and then came up to Prescott many many years ago and so this has always been a spot on his map\nAnd then um my boss Tom bill came out here about six seven years ago so it's been a a long term project to to get where we're at today\nSo I'm the founder must have fallen in love with Prescott like everyone can when you come here yes\nThere's something about Prescott as you know you once you experience it or you just don't want to ever leave and and the reason I've been here almost a decade\nYep I'm so tell us a little bit more of any other fate is there anything that we should be aware of\nIt so we're going to be opening the west wing of our building which has assisted living um later a quarter one of two thousand Nineteen and so we'll have assisted living services a than a we'll have early ... memory care support\nAs well as a full memory care a whole nother phase that will happen in a year or so\nSo they're still face to which will have more independent living homes than a full memory care support as well\nBut we've just been very well received by the community and we'll have a over half of our homes have already been contracted\nAnd you have beautiful facilities um you have a favorite color on the tour of the walking toward that we went on um a a gym and just maybe you can share a little bit about that\nYes so we have of course the fen restaurant which is open to the public and that's housed within our clubhouse building which is a standalone building that offers a services that anyone can access so the fan is is open seven days a week or from eleven AM to nine PM and have a great menu and a great chef\nAnd then downstairs we have our health and fitness club and that it's available for folks Fifteen over on a membership base is also open to the public beautiful indoor swimming pool hot tub massage room all sorts of state of the art equipment and plus lots of classes\nAre from yoga tai chi stretching you name it\nSo all all things that are residents are included in their package but then folks are that are just living in the community that are looking for a spot to grab a bite or work out a we have that too\nI Know I've been to the restaurant several times and it's it's amazing it as a had a great experience each time\nWell the views are just hard to top it's amazing you show up that hill and you you don't realize how much of a bird's eye view you get\nNow you also do have transportation that helps out of a transport folks around town to\nAbsolutely we have our full service retirement community so that means when someone moves and in their home they have a full washer and dryer full set of appliances and then they don't need to worry about paying utility bills or maintenance uh we take care of all of that\nAnd then we do have a transportation services throughout the quad cities than a life in Richmond director that manages all the events than activities\nSo I I see people when they move in their social calendar all of a sudden becomes very full which is fun to watch\nYeah that that sounds like it you know you that that sounds like a great place to to know that your loved ones there in that they're getting engaged and involved because that really helps the quality of life\nIt really does and and so much has changed within the industry in the last Fifteen Years or so or where people are are living longer and they're expecting a different experience as they grow older and because people are more healthy and more aware of\nThings that they can do to to be more healthy when they're in their seventies and eighties uh there's just a whole nother chapter and it's exciting adventure for people that that can make a move to a resort style like touch mark and have everything taken care of\nCan they have ...\nAbsolutely I see I Am thinking about my line you know when I moved there right now they're party well yeah they are part of the family we have a dog park as well so and I know that\nYet it's near our Central Park area a behind her outdoor amphitheater oh we have all sorts of events and activities and how can I forget mentioning pickle ball we have to pick up all courts\nWeight really notice it\nAnd yes yeah we have hiking groups that go out we have just really some seasoned a high a hiking leaders that go throughout the community and folks are just so active it's just amazing how active people are and it's ... I'm I'm looking at these folks and seeing their schedule and I get tired even looking\nAt [laughter] actually now have they set up that zip line a gun to Walmart\nYeah and I was in the city license says and I know\nThat whenever I go there if people talk about that and we just need to you know\nShopping or right off the street trader Joes a uh\nThe streets of jazz a a trial you know I really are into the pinnacle of Prescott\nYeah it's it's exciting and you have a little bit of a some neighbors coming in grip stone\nOr their ribbon cutting recently and how that is a beautiful spot on it is\n... ... what struck me is we've had a corporate event there and and just to see all the different ages interact or from teenagers on up and and that's just fun to see a a community spot like rip stone and um if there's a lot happening on that side of town of course the new condominiums and being built right now mhm yeah I notice they're clear in the land\nYeah we help them with their groundbreaking it was fun and they invited all of you I recall seeing you there as well and uh I mean what a beautiful community a touch market the ranch and I just I'm very impressed with the project in and out of touch markets so community minded to\nThey really are we're a privately held company so our founder Warner ... still owns a company and and his family um\n... helps run it and so just having that mindset that if you do right by the market the market's going to do right by you and so we we try to get involved wherever we can obviously I'm working with the chamber and and being involved in the community uh it it helps to kind of know\nWho to talk to on where we can be of best service\nUm ... do you ever get your ah residents are excited about the possibility of volunteerism outside of the community\nYes with so many of them are ready volunteer but I Know Robert probably looking for more volunteer [laughter] but we we've talked about having like a volunteer fair spelling now that ... hour we're growing and we're\nGetting more residents are there's a critical mass of folks that um are some of them are new to the area and and don't know where to get plugged in and um so that that would be something ...\nAnd other animals are volunteers who are moving into touch market the rich they're already season so there you know they know all the information\nThat you may have mentioned this but I um I how many folks can you have up there on the hill\nSo we have forty two independent a single family homes of which we only have five left\nAnd then we have Ninety a completely independent condo style homes and then about fifty assisted living homes and then five get sweets so folks have family in town can actually stay on the floor where\nAnd and visit family or people that are looking at touch mark and come stay with us to get the full experience so will grow um anywhere between um three to four hundred residents roughly in this current stage and then in phase two we'll have more capacity down the road\nWow I didn't realize is that large\nIt's five hundred and fifty thousand square feet allow that to the underneath the building as a parking structure and or have housekeeping services it's like a giant hotel um and then all the common areas out there was almost a hundred thousand square feet of common areas within our community\nSo there's just lots of places
