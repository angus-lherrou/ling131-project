bears that took over the brewing industry after prohibition but while those fears are still produced in America that companies produce them are no longer America no we offer you a variety of premium domestic beer is\nProof right here in Arizona\nHow much more domestically made can you get made in America and Americans don't ruin companies real the real food real people and real local\nListening to talk of the doubt on ... once again here's your host Laura Bush here welcome\nThat this is your ... for Sharon today I'm Talking with Dr Carla Philips and Justin ... how are you guys today I'm doing great and you guys are with ... pi college yes that's correct that's correct so tell me a little bit about um what you guys do at the college well\nUh we both are at that you know valley campus which is our agribusiness center so we're basically playing with plants and animals most of the time\nA lot yeah I mean so the dean for a career in technical lead for the college and I run that campus and so I guess I just get to tell people what to do or something like that yes the bigwig now\nAnd I'm just in Britain and I am the agribusiness instructor and I worked for Dr phil she's she's my boss said don't say anything to do that at all summer [laughter] and um I just mentioned the Puerto agribusiness I get the specific we teach people about\nPlants horticulture is what most students are looking for and then I also cover classes like um soils and water management and those that fall under that category\nAnd you guys have a giant greenhouse over there is that correct\nThat is correct and uh it's a great classroom for students to be able to learn in an environment um and when things get rough outside we get to go and learn in a perfect environment but we also want students to working outside environments is what we have also orchards a small vineyard I'm announcing growing areas\nSo it's a lot of hands on his what I'm listening to your hands on training at totally everything we do it that campuses\nDot fantastic I mean a lot of places you go to you don't have that hands on training it it's very you know just in school it's all learn on the computer or read this book but it's often times you leave the college and you have no idea how to actually do it\nOr areas definitely applied area in a\nWhile and you know his career in technical lead your training people to go out and get into the workforce and if they just look at it in the book they're not going to be able to to succeed in the workforce so we we let them do what it is they're going to need to\nBe doing gotcha guys give classes on how to not kill plants I'm probably the number one\nPlant to let her know I don't know why but everything else I own a has\nTo be you know non you know it has to be plastic plants or have felt\nThe silk there you go into both of us who have horticulture science\nClasses and they're pretty intense um both fall and spring and those are for credit our classes so might be a little more time than you're prepared to commit but I'm due to the fact that a lot of people are interested and just\nGetting started and finding out we have summer classes that are shorter in nature but a lot of students pick those classes and they get hooked him also teaching organic gardening class right now in the fall but great for both um students trying to get credit but also for community ed folks\nWow that's great is that the one that's on line\nIt is completely online the summer gloss was completely in person so we try and give options for all folks you\nCan say you guys have an online course\nWe do and what we do a lot with our courses um\nWe do we try to be convenient for students and what their time frames allows so again applied science is a lot of our classes being hybrid in nature we have extended lab period um and then they do the remainder of their course work or research or a test quizzes that kind of thing it's a college class will they do those parts on one\nSide and what else do you guys got going on there's a lot of classes I Know\nThere are a lot of classes and uh we have I as I mentioned it's plants and animals\nJustin's or plant guy and art and for especially for me I like my God and then our animal person we have a couple of animal these people are ... and Andy Lloyd\nAnd money helps train people to work in zoos residue in domestic animal care and then Andy works with specifically canine where we start with training and handling and uh work up to a canine service dog training so that you can literally train a service dog\nAnd uh that went by the wayside oh you know it's just it's one of those things you just bounce back and start doing other things and trying to recover from what you've got\nAnd ah I think we're on track of her we did move we did move uh Prescott valley from friday to Wednesday we had a lot of people didn't understand that but one of our big clients out there uh or our clients go to Dee yes I've had and the problem was is that the idea has told us that they don't have people that are on friday\nYou know they they're either in meetings or that's there a take off day or you know whatever oh\nGotcha so they actually don't have like staff and a whole lot of people that\nThat's right and the ones that are there and meetings and people take the bus to get there and then they have a hard time getting scene and be ready for the bus coming back five yeah so we decided that Wednesday would be a better day\nAnd we were going to make it Tuesday or Thursday for the second day but that's not going to happen until maybe next year\nIs that what you're saying that came out with a new boss gets all\nYes and we came out with a new bus schedules scheduled to show the switch in the days actually [noise] excuse me actually the um times at the bus stops or basically the same okay and our route is going to be basically the same we just took friday and moved to Wednesday Wednesday and moved to friday\nOkay so you just did a little switch right not traffic gets a little yeah yeah well the people think it's a it's a ... but a lot of people aren't used to change and\nYou know they'll get used to it but it's it's better for the people that do use the er that's who we are trying to do\nAnd you're just trying to help those other people out\nOh yeah yeah I mean they needed a typical uh a government they had their original office in the far west side of Prescott and they moved it to the far east side of Prescott valley so no way for the people to get down there\nAnd just so we're talking about how much does it cost to I'm a ride on the bass a\nActually when we started ten years ago it's exactly the same as it is today I yeah there you know it's that two dollars two dollars a ride but if you're disabled or if you are or over sixty a it's a fifty percent discount so it's a dollar\nWhat a great deal we have people that come in they'll grab a taxi from pollen and come to a safe way for thirty dollars and then jump on our bus and drive it into Prescott for a buck wow you know so it's it's a this is\nThis is something that we really need to resonate through our ridership is\nHis continually increasing um uh two years ago we had we hold and transport six thousand people last year we are close to ten thousand people for the last couple of years has been going up thirty three percent a year\nYeah you can definitely it is going up wow who may\nYeah we're really worried pleased when we first started if we got two hundred three hundred people a year we thought that was great you know but as the years have progressed as the buses have gotten better as people knew that we have provided the transportation service they started to pick it up and\nAnd one thing that people might not know about you guys is that yeah the regional transit is a nonprofit\nOh yeah that's a that's one of the things that there was one time one period of time about five years ago\nThat the town of ... valley\nUm was our sponsor and then they decided they didn't want to sponsors anymore so we said we shut the system down or we become a non profit\nAnd uh our hearts got in a way of making a good business and so we uh we became a non profit and it's ironic because\nOut of all the thousands of bus transport systems across the United states there's only a half a dozen that are nonprofit yeah I have one right here\nI see is that support are nonprofit founder and\nYeah yeah and it's a you know we appreciate everything that we can possibly do for anybody great we also are to help us out make the match money\nUh we have become a certified tax credit company so excellent it's like the schools a lot of people have a tax burden of up to four hundred on a single or eight hundred on an individual\nAnd they write a pack a the the dollars they owe to the state\nYou we now can accept those dollars and those people get a hundred percent dollar for dollar tax credit now and he stays right here and that way yes and if you're used to given to the schools you can still do that also\nI mean because we are in two different arenas and the schools can get there's if you have your tax burden is even over a hundred\nYou know so you can give freely that both without having to worry about\nExactly and the thing of it is is we're a set in our ... our uh our website up with stripe so that people can get on and just donate right through strike and a easy as he ...\nAnd where do you guys service I Know you said ... valley where else do you that\nWell yeah we service Prescott Prescott though we service Prescott five days a week okay Chino valley five days a week than ... and ... one day a week\nUh but we do have a summer a route that's been approved and we've been doing it for four years and that we've kind of the label that as the polling plunge you know we felt it was part of our civic duty to do a lot of stuff\nAnd the ... just finished up as school started got sickly what that is is we\nHave sponsors that donate money and we go out and pick up kids in the pollen and this year we had eight hundred the rides that we did for for ... right around four hundred kids in the pool all free\nAnd then we paid for their history the from the sponsors\nHow nice of you guys to do something like that well that stand out there that is exactly what I'm saying that you guys you so much for our community and do something like that it's just fantastic\nWe take we we have volunteer writers myself and usually councilman best and we have two other guys that know that they have\nAnd some and best and we have two other guys that know that if in fact they were going to do that they do it voluntarily and um we do it for like fifty days we drove twenty five hundred miles this year are just going back and forth back and forth\nAnd it works out very well it's amazing the kids that have never been to the pool and have never swam in a public pool\nAnd you can't hide out and what was it like almost four hundred kids yeah we had four hundred kids and uh you know it's one of those things that\nIt ... does your heart good and people are willing willing to donate matter of fact I Want to give a shout out to the corners club\nOn their auction this year they called us and said we'd like to donate Fifteen hundred dollars to the polling pledge and that just that set us very very good\nOh that makes me sound really cat well it's all restricted funds save that money that has donated to the wire T can only be used for that right so in the town gives the Seventeen hundreds afraid the costs of the bus was\nThat we send out there this year we were at sixteen hundred and fifty dollars\nAnd the year before we were only fifty dollars the other way how funny I mean it it helps everybody when you do get involved with the humidity because then they remember you they they will tell people about you and we're helping support community\nAnd I know you guys I said you free rides and for certain people\nYeah people either well you know we started I'm a free\nRide for veterans and it started a little bit slowly because the only you know there are so many veteran organization there as you know\nWe didn't want to drive or to have to sit there and go through a notebook of IDs to find out that they were a veteran so what we did is through our board we zeroed in to either a driver's license or an M. V. D. I. ID card turned Ninety degrees\nAnd it says veterans on there and if they have that on their driver's license they can drive they can ride free anytime of the day any Raul we'd go to anywhere we go to and that lasts forever\nSo that's our way of excuse me thinking the veterans for their service and to help the community a little bit more 'cause there was a lot of homeless veterans out there right and not know that oh yeah yeah us that they had a\nThey had an article in the paper last week I think to work now a dot is forgiving the fee to get that changed for the veterans so we have started another rash of information hey go down and get us vets will take 'em down there\nAnd get their driver's licence changed and then all you gotta do shows that card and then you write for free ride for free than we're we're handling about a hundred hundred veterans a month and it's even going\nHigher than I can ask you how many veterans out a hundred a month\nHundred a month we did twelve hundred last year and uh so we're starting on her second here with this and it has anything like a ridership it's probably going to go up\nMore early in your ridership definitely has gone up like oh you're asking about the the buses all the time and then I Know that you guys are going to start doing some advertising that's correct to yeah we're we\nI'm gonna get sponsorships for windows and things like that and being a nonprofit that helps us with the job of making the match money\nBecause you know for every dollar that you spend or that the federal government gives you you they only give you like eighty percent and you've got to come up with the other twenty cents and so it's the same thing with us I mean our match last year was a hundred and twenty six thousand\nSocially quality the seeming a
