of California called the south uber reverse citizens calling an acronym of circle\nUm they put this together about Fifteen Years ago um as as a way to educate folks about what's going on with their river what's going on with rivers around the world\nAnd the idea is that folks get inspired about all the exciting things that rivers providing our lives um to do we're not as connected to the river as we were say hundred hundred and fifty years ago but they are really the defining Carroll wasn't\nThe Mississippi River is a dividing line it is Indiana was the was the the conduit for all the commerce for a hundred years practically in the United states after year up in Red Bluff California on the Sacramento River okay yeah you know if we don't uh some people who live around here\nProbably don't realize what it's like to be on a river\nHow beautiful that doesn't have starting that is\nYeah granted creek and the Verde River or to local rivers that's all part of diversity river watershed and wherever you stand on this land is stand within a watershed\nIn so I think one of our one of our things that we've been trying to do is help folks understand that we're all in this watershed you know even here in Prescott and down in the ... valley at the same ecological\nAnd after all this rain I mean it's pretty obvious where you know this is this is so beautiful and dumped a more to see um what is the proceeds going to go to and we'll go and do we are charging admission right correct or\nIt's a benefit to the tree good credit partner to put this on which has spent the better Prescott

Roberts\nSo how low again and welcome back to the Thursday roundtable Deborah castle in his with is when I was with us\nAnd what a wing will just say hello to your wife she is she's in charge really you know we're all real that's true [laughter]\nThat I'm where I'm Talking about the apple pie college border arrested the board of trustees as a board of governors sort of dollars when you're on the board you been on a ... a little while and on for years I have four more years to go did you and you worked ...\nYears old for many years over thirty four years I worked there and um\n[noise] watch watch were former tucked away in about his candidate see a lot of talk to you about what is it what does the history of you have a park college why is the word is how is it a functioning financially\nFinancially well my concern is that our student numbers continue to drop while our budget continues to go up [noise]\nWow yes but not uh so we're spending ... wires are dropping in student activity well they used to say it was such a good economy under Obama that students to go back to school they had jobs\nThey now they can say yes it's very good economy under Trump but so many people are coming back in retraining and using the community colleges so I think we just need to focus on getting students in and educating yo yo pike county students and spend their money wisely\nAnd you know for several years I worked at Embry riddle and uh that's an expensive place to go to school and we talked to a lot of people who are looking to come in and we suggested they go to the community college and get the core courses and taken care of so that when you transfer him\nYou know you can get into your the the area of your major studies whatever that might be\nAnd to do that you have to get the the school that you take the basic courses in has to be accredited are brilliant all of your basic yes those are good at this or someone stress from any you guess you you they are anywhere else that you know the good head start and still live at home\nYes and many of our students do dual enrollment while they're in high school really and a few kids will actually graduate from college and the next week at their high school\nYet so that's I Love that program because it's it really serves our taxpayers' well we know that our dollars are going to educate our yeah pike county students and given the break in the advantage that they can get by going to community college\nOne of the things and of course we always rural round about talking in getting a college degree and all that but one of the things that I've seen you have a pi do is there a lot of the classes in\nTwo areas warn is like just learning stuff stuff classes and the others are led and an ... learning a trade mechanic work auto mechanics type of thing tell me a little bit about all that well\nWe have a great critical education we have a center in Chino valley and it's amazing with all the different courses they can take in its they're up to the minute type things with our\nTraining and ... and then computer training and when we have a working with the diesel program with the mine in Baghdad\nAnd I mean it it's a great program they develop some construction program again we used to build a house here and now we're not building a house but we're training people in the construction trades so I mean there's mechanics there's\nA special machines that cut the metal and I\nMean I don't know what it all over our heads as yet I wanted to go to school and all that and what I Hope to see is more that expanded in the ... valley\nThere are a lot of educational needs over there that we haven't met yet we're doing a great job for our students in Prescott Prescott valley Chino agricultural agricultural programs there and oh it's so you don't want him growing\nThe wind grinds over in ... yeah and that's an outstanding program I guess you're ... you're on the grapes and they make it into a you know [laughter] but uh that's a big thrill we asked them outstanding faculty and staff to make the college what it is a great place it is and then\nAnother thing that over the years I've seen is uh classes for seniors who just you know one\nOf the right where are all courses are whole ocean or learning programs they are paying the their self sufficient we have a grant that helps pay for 'em different administrative cost so uh yes it's really big especially over in Sedona and then here and press kit\nAnd all of this has it wouldn't start that way\nBut no we had some different senior programs and went to college first on that but when one was a college origin or his classes are in Nineteen sixty nine fold sixty nine\nAnd I guess it was just so they used to call them or or afternoon Judy\nI guess it was just so they used to call them or or afternoon judge called during college most days\nYes and I'm actually in the fall of sixty eight I started to collapse in the fall of Nineteen Seventy really took a math class\nAnd there was all over the place we were ... on the campus but it was ... he had to take your flashlight at La Crosse thinks because it was indicted east yet and they didn't have the lighting out\nBut I graduated from college and then within a you got my bachelors or masters and came back and got the job I wanted to call it yeah back home yes so I had one employer my career and\nAnd I guess it makes you a as a member of the board of governors you're kind of you know the history to kind of see where you've been and where you want to go\nCorrect and I worked with every president of the college from John Barnes on in different capacities student employee alone [noise]\nSo uh now with the board member so I Do have the history I Do know what has happened in what was good what was bad I'm and I'm looking forward to but is bringing in a new president and continue names search still going on it's just they're taking applications through October twenty six\nThan the selection committee will review them on November ... and they plan to invite three to four candidates for ... on campus\nI interview with the public on December fourth and they'll be both in Prescott and diversity valley and then on the fifth the board will meet with them\nBut it's kind of a flux state now because we have to board members that we may have new people and they brought you you've got a verdict valley yes very rarely ... so I'm hoping that I'm\nPaul and Wayne will be successful and we'll get some people that are actually the other people in office right now or had been appointed 'cause there's hardly ever been a challenge or an election for the board members\nAri I Would ask you to a tough question now is ready for this sure we're going to bring back basketball [laughter]\nInteresting thing was sports so I Know a lot of people would love to see a back we I enjoyed it when he was there um it's gonna be a a a decision you know\nI mean we had we had had national success yet in soccer and baseball a and a basketball is always fun I don't know if we ever really got into the ... you know national recognition but we had some pretty good at managing specially\nWhen we had was his name Brooks somebody he was the coach boy he brought in some really outstanding ballplayers\nOne of the things that are I guess I Need to ask you before the break is uh [noise] how many students come in from out of state approximately go down in percentage wise for on the athletic teams there's a lot\nA whole lot there's maybe one student per team of the four teams that comes from the out by county\nSo attached to be expected because of the movie but the ... uh well if they're nurses that we have in the success that we've had other people want to conquer\nNo they get recruited and they get they get great well I mean when I started ... you know they want to come here because someone recruits from now I Want to do well they get young great scholarships and I mean about eight hundred thousand dollars of the budget goes to athletic scholarships how much eight hundred thousand dollars well\nAnd that's what we include some woman sport\nYes men's and women's it's all the sports but that's a lot of money that goes for scholarships\nAnd not ... as far as I can tell us probably worth it\nI Do know that sort of other topic for another topic um we just need to focus on educating our yeah pike county students first okay thank you very much for your time out and run on a turn a microphone over to wane\nWell over ... over the years uh the current uh the cardboard or not necessarily Deb\nBut a has had voted for constant tuition increases a wallet how in fact a a put a ... or excuse me I have a pi college at uh the second most expensive to your school in Arizona\nAnd there were numerous other as a child way below a and that's you know when I went to Wayne State that was like going from in those days uh you know from two thousand a corridor for University of Michigan to four hundred dollars a quarter\nAnd you know you get you get more more people who can who can stand the freight who want to go\nI think there was talking about eight hundred thousand dollars in scholarship money so are you suggesting we reduce that no no that was just for the athletes well OK loans they can get or green or let me talking about ... not fully scholarships how do you feel about is that about fair or do you think\nYou know ... I\nI read the paper and I see there's a lot of student athletes uh you know going to Prescott a high school and and uh and then and then leaving you know and and basically uh\nBe you know and and basically uh\nUh now you know back in the day I I played some some baseball but uh not good enough to [laughter] to play on a college team\nBut I think that uh you know we could we could do better than just one token on each one of the teams from a from the local area\nSo naturally that cut down on the scholarships a little bit better wouldn't wouldn't devastated by enemy\nAnd speaking of scholarship money or is it is that a a welder those going drivers are always up dust\nThere used to this is gone the merit scholarship fund so they can be the students scholarships for athletes a merit based scholarship um that when the government the state cut the college funding community college funding by about half\nThey took a lot of money out of the scholarships\nThey kept the same amount for Barrett scholarships that they dropped the academic merit scholarships so currently we really don't go to the high schools and yet by county and say here based on your marriage at your high school [noise] here's a scholarship to go to Europe I call it ...\nMy my daughter graduated from high school and she does get a small scholarship to go you have a pi college there wasn't a wasn't big but it looks like\nWe don't do that anymore no they have to show up there and then they we help them with the honors program but we used to go to the high schools in a ward yeah college governors board scholarships\nWing if you're on the board water some of the things that you want to say a year from now here's one of some of things that I helped accomplish\nWell one of the things I'd like to say is that I uh\nI lowered tuition or from its current rate\nI'm also that ah\nYou know I'm not a big tax fan Chuck and uh\nThe uh the board has raised your property taxes five times in the last nine years and you know I'm an old investigator and I I have to know who what where when and why before I vote for anything I just don't know if the administration says oh yeah we all want you to pass this\nIt has to pass the acid test I have to know what I'm what I'm really voting for so it's not I'm not going to be ... cents in other words it's gonna be I'm going to do as they say a little investigation\nThere's a a ... have to help help me on this but there's a small campus in Prescott ballot on Glasser hill road or is is I've heard rumors that that's going to be expanded\nIn Aspen expanded and uh we did it a couple of years ago for the allied health programs and we built the first floor and open that up last fall\nNow there are working on the second story that building and that is being expanded I'm not sure of all what's going to be there but I Know are small business development and our ADC the regional economic development officers will be there and tone possibly some things are going to\nGo out building a out on the highway I understand you're on the property up there we own\nA good amount of property there there could be more uh depends on what the what comes up\nFor the board you know we're in one of the things that I Know is a kind of a real feather and the and the cat for the colleges of nursing program oh yeah\nUh do you feel it's adequate at all it's a well I was just a at a a at a meeting or oh three or four weeks ago when they had some young ladies who are still in high school\nAnd ah they were involved in the ah a digital program the J to program it and they were going to a\nAccumulate credit hours accumulating experience and they you know they could uh uh when they when they completed the program they could go right to a major university and the\nPoint being is a ... with their little a lifetime career that's right\nYou know college and the mountain Institute used to be tied down to Jay tech\n[noise] um anyway the acronyms or not but it's a technical Programme that students will be involved in high school\nAnd their offices are located right at my college and our own C. tech building in Prescott valley so I mean excuse yet at the airport so um we have really close ties here and we're developing more in the ... valley with the valley academy\nBut um they're they're back to the program so I I these partnerships are great and they do the most to help our pike county high school kids\nWeren't wearing we have a minute left for you to say Chuck here's why I Want you to vote for me\nChuck here's why I Want you to vote for me not only will I not raise your property taxes but I'm going to work to get a lot of transparency on the board that I feel isn't there at the current time\nAnd uh you know just take a really good look at what's going on and how we can improve the college\nHis name's Wayne ... and if you live in the ... district quorum you'll see his name on the on the ballot\nContinues excess and thank you for your service or to our country thank you very ... back with Sanford cones interview with mark Sally right after these words\nAnd so joining me now on TALK of the town here on period you and I would like to welcome back congresswoman Martha McSally having just completed a successful run in the Republican primary here in Arizona now getting ready for the\nGeneral election and congresswoman Shelley welcome back to ... hey thanks for having me on it\nSo the first things first the replacement for the late Senator John McCain someone whom you're very familiar with Senator Jon Kyl talk a little bit about your experience with John ...\nWell I think Senator Jon Kyl is an incredible\nPack I'm so grateful he is willing to step up and serve our state and our country again after Eighteen years and the Senate I worked for Senator Kyl when I was a major in the air force I uh competed at MIT selected for this legislative fellowship I could have worked for any of the five hundred and thirty five members of Congress\nOr the Senate a and I was elected by him and I picked him and I got to be on his national security team for a year\nA wall on active duty and I just even a mentor than an inspiration to me a and a lot of ways I jokingly say I blame him for stepping up to serve a and run for the house myself because he was such a good example of a conservative fighter and leader who is highly respected as they work horse\nA and really made a difference for our state and our country so a out any attack again he he is certainly ... years of service and the fact that he was willing to step up and start again at this very crucial time for us\nOr just shows the character of a man and a commitment that he has to our country so he then three of the metric for me and my campaign and I look forward to serving liquor and when I get over there and the fact that\nThe general election now that you're facing your opponent on the Democrats are those Kirsten Sinema
