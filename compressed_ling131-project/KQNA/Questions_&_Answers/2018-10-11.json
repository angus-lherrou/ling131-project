I guess that it gives me the question why do people leave that's behind ... what's the motivation there to do that to give up its like that we're trying to\nPart of what we're trying to do is be a little more innovative in educating the community\nAbout pet care and about ... responsibility a lot of people um you know they there's there's certain circumstances change and so they move on or they don't realize that a pet is a part of a family\nSo um we're trying to reach out to the community to educate them to to teach them um how caring for a\nPet is in a lifetime commitment so um we're hoping to start seeing improvement in in that kind of thing happening but circumstances to\nChange and we don't judge we want to make sure that the animal is taking care of as best as possible so we certainly understand that people need to surrender their animals we try not to\nMake them feel badly or more ballet than they already do\nWell life could be worse than turning a ... into the humane society I'm sure so uh yeah I could see why you wouldn't want to be judgmental of exactly so so I guess I should put it in my request I'm a brown and white young should sue [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd I'm Renee one every once in a while um so what would you know what's the future for the humane society or what advice can you give pet owners are who want to make sure they're doing you know everything to keep their pets safe with what advice do give\nWell I think there's there's quite a few things I think we're that we're turning messages that were trying to get out right now one of them is to make sure that you always have identification on your pet whether that's a microchip cholera tag or whatever it vets get lost\nIn most strangest ways and the most unexpected ways and if you're not prepared you may not ever see your your pet again um there's a lot of new law that research and resources now it's just been developed in the last five to ten years it\nKind of the way that we've always searched for our pets in the past isn't the best way now we need to understand their behavior and their instincts better\nSo there's all kinds of new ways to to go about finding your pet we need people to make sure that they're bringing pets they find to the shelter 'cause that's where people are going to go to look for them\nUm we talk about regular veterinary care and spider\nUm we talk about regular veterinary care and Spain editor a we have people who don't pay and neuter and they don't intentionally do it that just adds to the number of animals in our care that adds to the number of animals in the community and they're not always vaccinated and protect it so I think that's very important also\nSo if I Want to do to help you guys out no Casey Rooney so the economy was what would you recommend how can I help you\nWell we have a bunch of events coming up and I'm all\nFor the holidays we have a lot of different events they're all different types of events from a brave thing to have fun and uh so we've got several of those that that we could mentioned in it that would be a great way to get support us and start to get involved\nOr do you need people to come in and actually help ... with somebody like me just being the way or do you need people to walk dogs ... with all the neat little\n... year um volunteers are a huge part of our organization we couldn't function without them\nBut we have volunteers working in a variety of different things does some dog walkers we have cats socialize we have fostered we have um we have people who can't necessarily get out of their own home\nSo we have them right thank you ... we have them make phone calls we have people and greeters so there's always something for volunteers to do and there are essentially really truly like I said we can't function without volunteers\nNow you have a full on board of directors and you have a lot of of volunteers or not enough volunteers and tell me a little bit about the board of directors were seven\nMember team right now um we have some everyone is in the local community very involved with the community very passionate about the humane society um we are working very hard to to make sure that\nThe humane society and the best they can be um and we're we're we're lucky to have tasty pastor as our executive director she's very innovative and her thinking she comes from a very large shelter organization and um\nI think she's going to see some real positive making positive changes at the shelter that's going to benefit the entire community\nSo if people want to find you where do they go to find you how did they get to your facility\nWe're right on where at Fifteen twenty west men get the avenue right past the cottonwood airport\nWhere okay five every day except Sunday okay do you remember what kind of dog I'm looking for yes I Do\nOkay good well hey I have to wind down here are just really want to think of both Rebecca and Victoria for joining me today very

Veterans Day is always in my ... but the parade this year is new\nMember ... ... we had we had some folks on here from sort of your Prescott talking about that because there's so many veterans that are going to go to church on Sunday to so many churches that are involved in the traffic situation\nThat uh and to me um the eleventh hour the eleventh month living day but\nTo have a parade busted I have a price on a Saturday come up\nIt is it is and it's the community does and it's just a free you can enter it is that the parade is a free events\nOr you just have to get your application in a before October twenty second and anybody can can be an entry there's no you know requirements of any sort [noise]\nIf you don't want to you know be in the parade that you'd like to be a spectator there's plenty of room gets bring your chairs with you and make sure you get there early\nPark somewhere a ways away um because you're not going to park and we were closed because of all the staging for all the entry wage for a drought generally the youth our usual ... the same parade route that we have every year or so it\nUm basically where it started everybody every yet everybody comes down\nAnd we had the opening ceremony to begin to ten thirty which we have the speaker from the VA and that up mayor of Prescott and Dr airs from Emory riddle\nI'll do the national anthem and and we kind of kick it off and then from there because everybody basically goes around the courthouse down and then back up and they end Murphy's\nSo I'm at the same ... a parade route that we've always had the only thing that's different is it this year is on the tenth and like you had said Chuck some of it is yes there are people like to go to church on Sunday but\nThere is for church in just in that the Cindy where we normally staging and if you've been down there for the parade you see that if you live in that area your whole front yard and and everything around you is\nIs taken out and you can't park on the street you can't do anything because any everybody is covering every part of that so do you think about that the churches means their parking lots are are blocked so anybody who wants to can you measure that urge to go to church exactly\nI Would imagine that in the in those four churches runner there's a tornado forty percent a population of veterans who would like to be either in or see the\n... and they can't do both the same time what times over it's dark and all that the parade starts at eleven AM that's opening ceremonies at ten thirty okay we've got that down yes or and that is Saturday Saturday November tense anybody and everybody is welcome it will be aired on access to the side of the new VA channel\nYou know you can also watch it if you don't want to come out for the break because I noticed starting to get a little chilly out now says some people I don't want to come out but that's okay you can watch it on TV channel sixty five yes and we will have veterans from I'm arguing and living center\nSome of them a sit in the seats that is nice heated tenth of the city of Prescott gets there that are veterans can sit there nice and warm and some of them\nActually walked through the ... with us or we approached him in the wheelchairs and\nAnd they wave and it's it's really really creative and\nI Want to I Want to get a quick plug in before we go to break a that I'm On that Monday there is a western swing a concert at the ... theater and I'm a portion of the proceeds all go to the VFW post brisket so\nUh that's a bit of a very high awareness of our veterans and the sacrifices that they have given and the families have given so a lot of good things going on we'll take a merry away from\nThat particular area and talk about some of the other things that are going on right after we pause\nFor these words and you know there's a radio announcer who had small hands they said he had a brief pause for no my funny\nChanged your mind you know and\nFor not ever Ninety five point five FM Prescott valley got one more miracles now ...
