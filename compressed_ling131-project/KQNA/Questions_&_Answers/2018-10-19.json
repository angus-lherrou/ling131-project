Mike was out at the cardinals and hey if you didn't do much better the score was closer but uh still will a lot of things to talk about between now it's six o'clock and uh I'm just wondering if uh\nMike He is on\nOr not he should be just called back yellow Mike ... he's got some sort of problem I guess when I'm On the phone problem I guess\nBecause I Know he'd he'd like to be jumping in on the cardinals since he went\nThere first but uh\nThis is live radio for that [laughter] as soon as you know thank God there's not a video camera camera on me right now no kidding so um so what do you think the problem is\nI have no idea is locked in a hung up again so that they'd be called back and and you've got the line ... calling and I do I got it like\nOh okay\nThey call them black line now so let's see what happens there\n\nAny who while we're waiting what else do you got the\nDial let's go here I mean you know there's plenty to talk about the baseball playoffs as as well Red Sox punch their ticket to the world series and tonight will be watching the brewers taken on the Dodgers and there's some interesting things to talk about in that series as well mainly Manny Machado\nAnd uh he's a come [laughter] somebody we all can hate now he's a seems like he's a player that will do anything then even Christian yell edge of the brewers called them up out because I don't know if you saw the play or not when he was running down to first base and\nYou just kick the first baseman leg I mean you could break a guy's ankle or something when you do something crazy like that so instead of hitting the bag he charges in kicks or the leg of a sous Agassi are\nAnd I'm Christian yellow which had the perfect answer they interviewed him in the clubhouse after the game and he said uh\nWell I was a dirty play by a dirty player [laughter] so I thought whoa whoa that's pretty intense saw\nOne thing to watch for the brewers are losing eight to nothing Manny Machado comes up tonight you may get one or right between the numbers\nSo we'll see how that works out so I don't make and I also want to touch on baseball and uh I don't want it too far ahead once we get him plugged in stock area finally\nYeah I didn't I didn't want to steal all your thunder so I'm just kind of ... capital of the fans of things will be going over the the great game as we saw in the valley last night Thursday night the sons being undefeated coyotes finally winning the game and then\nYou you and me were all isn't on major league baseball and I've got a new new player now that I I really don't like is Manny Machado I just can't believe the stuff that guys that up to so\nAnd the controversy a home run ball\nThat uh uh Jose up all too they hit and looked at me like a fair did not interfere but I saw this awesome shot of that if I can all get into this but the reason you know what might cause a lot of times they'll have a camera right on the wall and you can tell that somebody reach over not reach over\n... around that a little bit but you know basically ... shot could've said I got a monkey off my back or a gorilla and of course price with what he did was change jobs change up last night you know he got a girl off his back that was he got\nGodzilla or whatever the you know the a huge girl off his back I mean his numbers were just unbelievably terrible for much money they pay that guy\n... in a loving stars with a six point like one sixty are and then he\nCame through your writing career so too I mean I think he you know nine strike out it's going to give up one run any anyone seven innings and and it shows how they can kind of be funny they were going to pinch hit for him in the fifth inning\nAnd then I think the guy made it out or something and they rubber ... and so he pitched\nTo more innings and eventually in one of them I think he walked in scored around so it all worked out for the Dodgers but a ... I'm with you there back in Milwaukee and uh hey it'd be kind of sweet to see a crate counseling the brewers when two in a row\nI think the TV and major league baseball\nAnd you know if you follow the money would not have\nBeen as happy of Milwaukee in Houston was in it of course Boston linger market bigger who raw in LA I mean so I think there and and that's why some people might have thought on this replay that we're talking about a few minutes ago\nYeah why do they go against Houston and for Boston you know as you know conspiracy theory has anything to do with that but I get it more to do what they chubby security guard getting in a way\nBut I still think going back to that that should have been home run granted the game could have played out differently in a lot of different ways so that was fairly early in the game but um yeah well so you're you're right\nThough the the TV executives are doing back flips because their worst nightmare would have been brewers astro would not have been happy with that as the final two teams so they're just praying now the Dodgers are in there too and\nThey're all you know those ratings will go way up and two storied franchises even though the Dodgers I don't think I'm going one and\nThirty years and I think I read another stab my ... I think it was back in Seventy seven Seventy eight that the Dodgers and went to two World Series in a row which I think the laws so it's been going to be forty years\nSince they went back to back in the world series if they could pull it off 'cause they were in the world series last year I'll be if they lost yeah and I think a lot of history there like we're we're kind of a moaning of you know the facts like the diamond backs and are playoff record but\nYou know a lot of people would guess that have been Thirty years since the Dodgers last World Series victory that's a long time\nAnd Seventy seven Seventy eight Dodgers Yankees talk about executives dream that's what they would be hoping for not you know Boston in LA would be the New York Yankees or the Mets even in LA and that didn't happen to you know the Yankees were in there but\nSeventy seven Seventy eight that goes back to the red gee you know three pitches three home runs and I think he had a fourth one in another bad it was on the other coast those type of things like we had a friend Gary she was at one of those games and Frank owed them was actually one of our other buddies\nWas at the three home runs game alone nearly no kidding only made his way up from Mississippi I got out of rain and bought a ticket from some you know yeah yeah so we had a buddy in the stands for that and then our other buddy I think saw Reggie hit\nThe force one in\nYou know the the couple of days later in LA you know three thousand miles apart so but those are the old days in a announced new days we'll see if the brewers and Craig ... some of those newfangled strategies can get it done and Wade Miley and ... back on the mound tonight\nFor the Milwaukee Brewers five thirty nine will be the first pitch will still be on the air so we'll let you know if anything's happening and I actually\nHis last started like ... were you is a better picture if you look good season stats but a Miley when I think five and two thirds innings and I think he didn't give up any runs were the brewers got right you for two runs in\n... for the third inning something like that so uh this will be interesting to see if we\nCan pull out the another ex diamond back doing well one of these towns you know we can all as a general yeah used to be on our team and we can make a heck of a team with X diamond back so I Wish him good luck he he was a good guy I really enjoy them he was kinda like duck dynasty down in the club or something he was\nHe was a real hoot so\nFit in further with Archie and or the other goofy guy with the beer that can't throw\nThrow to first base a relief pitcher I Can't think of his name right now there's so much going on and still frustrated on calling in ... I called in four times and I think she's like well what kind of like um um you know the the you know the old ah\nOr I Can't think of the the movie I had it on top of my time before the rock movie where the guy says oh we can turn it up to eleven I don't think we were turned up the one on the pod so so uh I I was on but it wasn't turned out so I could hear you guys beautifully I'm just glad that uh we got that I didn't want to do it and stuff\nTo do because I knew you know it's a lot more fun when we can talk about it rather than going rambling on but I was like oh maybe this was phone problem day or something but for now I can I can hear you perfect spinal\nTap spinal tap where they said oh I just turn it up to eleven and what we were turned down to zero I don't think we had it up to about one let alone a lab and\nSo when you're there now that godly the guy that can't throw a little downside just popped in my head to thank you you know you know you have big birthday is coming up a ah tonight's game again LA against Milwaukee five thirty nine first pitch and let's hope is a game seven we love game sevens\nUnless you're a Dodger fan but a game seven on Saturday with the it's six oh nine first pitch of course there's a lot of NFL\nTo go there's a lot of college this weekend\nBut the big talk of the town the national talk of the town\nIs the ... not just the issue which was an actual game we're going to get into that and I may I managed to kind of catch 'em all I Would say you went to the issue game I went to the cardinals game it was so bad I left after half time partly so I could get it home and catch and I take lots\nFor half time partly so I could get it home and catch and I take a lot of it I saw the third period of coyotes game I saw the last maybe ten minutes they issue a game and um you know so I got a chance to catch all that stuff or which was maybe a little bit more entertaining even though\nI got a lot to say about that game I wasn't too entertaining until like the last six minutes or something there was a surprise zero zero in crazy stuff going on with our own sense of coordinator in my opinion you know I'm not Mr football expert but\nThere was some just some goofy things are I think he is you\nHave a chance this has never isn't that good this year and she just you know they just three now bringing up pun there like lose their defense play well but let's let's go to the cardinals I I Would have left to I think I kind of you know one thing though that bothered me my was\nWhy in the world when you're getting just crushed like that beating like you know somebody with a stick you know spank and the kid or something back on the old days why would you leave Josh Rosen in the game and then sure enough\nHe's got a sprained tone down there I guess they finally did the X rays I think it's going to be okay\nBut he could have got a fractured flew into you know got injured because he was getting ... six times I think something crazy like that why wouldn't you just take him out of the game and go like hey there's no chance let's not mess with us kids let's get them on other\nWell and I agree with you and a lot of ways it's kinda like baseball when you've got a pitcher who's getting the lid on such a young one you kind of bring 'em out so it doesn't affect his psyche going forward now other people were saying and leave a man and give them a city you know experience because I was even saying like\nThis is when I Know it costs three hundred and twelve thousand dollars have Bradford suit up but it's almost like throw Radford back in there you know not that you could because he was not\nAgain he was not like Glenn and guys you know writing on her back on the line I theme yeah the other one minute Lennon you know we give him a little experience just like I kind of wanted to see\nThe uh part of Denver to bring in ... he played last year but you'll miss quarterback I'm Kelly that was a student Kelly's nephew so I was in Italy yeah yeah I was kind of looking forward to having I'm bringing in I'm trying to find got my little a spread to charge sheet here\nAnd uh uh with Kelly's first name I'm off and let's look for a quarterback Chad Kelly number six check Kelly I was hoping he'd get a little screen it's part of my part of my joke was er it'd been cool if check Kelly from old miss could have been sacked\nBy ... who's from old miss and they were teammates for one year you have the latest sacks somebody though well ... sack anybody chat and Kelly or not so I don't\nThink they played much in that game either you know there there's so many things you know we want to get into the like these are first round draft picks that aren't even playing right now and I just shaking my head and I'm hoping\nThis I think it's a minor shake up you know with a change our fence of coordinators because\nI have been questioning our head coach right now and even our defensive was supposed to be such a obese this year they haven't really lived up to what you would hope they would do either so there is is just a lot of things wrong with this team right now but uh\nWell when I go on it though I think I'm going to make a red hat and it's going to say him see Ga so won't be a mega had you know people were people won't be chew up or anything but it will be like make the cardinals great again\nAnd we can do it in their team color I bet I could sell thousands of those things right now you know people can wherever the games instead of a sack\nOver their head well you can set up on the great lawn and see if you can sell you I don't know I'm ... he probably wouldn't buy one I saw him out I was over at eighty eighth avenue and bell wrote a little while ago and I I was driving by and I saw him at the U Haul shop\nHe might have played the same thing like you did with the chargers and said no no we're not going there and you get rivers but rivers are still around rivers has been a very franchise type quarterback so that would be probably too but I did it again I'm going\nYou jumped the gun on me because you won't let me finish my by my my thought which happens a lot but um oh I'm saying is they they could win just enough games to screw up the number one pick and similar to\nBack in those six when they could have gotten a franchise quarterback not I didn't say they're going for a franchise quarterback but yeah they're going for a let's say a franchise\n... you know other type of player\nA three wins could be just enough to screw that up because buffalo and a few other teams are old boy in\nSan Francisco so when we do if the if the cardinals can beat San Francisco get what you asked for or Oakland\nAnd might not be a good move because those are the teams are in competition with an ... you hate this early in the year to be rooting for and a lot of people are a lot of people I mean my phone was blown up I was ... I think I was going to have one guy Steve cats he's been a season ticket holder since Nineteen eighty eight\nUm I was going to have him on because he was just oh man I don't know how many tax that guy from him and\nAnd he's like I'm fine let's just play for that number one draft pick let's just lose that\nI'm fine let's just play for that number one draft pick let's just lose the rest of the way so people are already thrown in there had\nGoing for that now will they\nWin a couple more and screw that up like they did know six forget about the Eli Manning talker river's just they screwed up\nThey can't even lose correctly is my point I think we used to use that the coyotes to they can't even lose correctly they win just enough games to bring them up a notch or two and then I like football league football for your last year last hockey and on some of the basketball too there's this you know the the envelopes\nAnd ping pong balls and even even though our general managers and screw up they don't get the right drafts lot because they don't get picked\nA so so we'll see we'll see how it happened is how this plays out but to lots of crazy stuff going on and car Deland and there's all these people that are probably moved to the valley in the last five ten Fifteen Years\nWho are just loving or war loving the cardinals were they going to be they're going to be jumping off the bandwagon can become LA ram fans are they become Las Vegas raiders fans soon you know because this this ain't going to get corrected anytime soon affect you saw it coming Bruce areas kept this thing together as best he could\nAnd we saw a couple of five hundred or close to five hundred teams the last couple of years but this was downright ugly and you know we could go on and on about numbers of stats only might\nOne funny thing is and I'll let you come back with some stuff that we've got a break probably coming up you gotta keep round the clock 'cause I don't really have one right in front of me butter pathway pass the break and we'll go to a break and we'll come back with you but to the fund I kept laugh about this and the press box it isn't as as we were getting beat up first quarter in fact affect alluded the first quarter\nBut one thing I had to laugh at it cracked up some of the guys and we're down fourteen to nothing looking as ugly as possible I go yeah but we've got you know time of possession I think we had ... minutes compared to six and a half time when the school was thirty five to three the cardinals had fourteen minutes compared to sixteen minutes and it was pretty much even at the end of the game\nBut that was because Denver just didn't have time to score they're blowing them all through they didn't have to have drives\nSo Denver Denver just von Miller is a genius see you know did he a ploy to get his team going be it he he used a guru or be it because you know war is going to be there and Kurt Warner couldn't win the dance with the stars championship like von Miller did ah you know and and actually\nThe ... the Gallup does dance with the stars was there to what's the what's the galley with ah we we go way back with um uh you know losing my mind here a lot that I watched dance with the stars that much but I Know I never was a choice in to the gallon always covers the world series with Fox\nUm [noise] that won\nA lawsuit because somebody was looking at here people I cannot think of her name but oh you know I Know you may ... guarantee as she was a ... yeah I Know I think um it'll come to me\nBut I mean it was it was three dance with the stars type people do it was Kurt Warner who we saw flying off to do that one time I think it was on Southwest Airlines and he did okay and I were going off on tangents here but then von Miller who actually want it doc I'm almost positive von Miller won the dance with the stars a couple of years back\nAnd then of course Aaron Andrew she's part of it but anyways um where did I got brass are going to keep that thing cranked up to eleven bill is going to push ... make all the right buttons doc\nIs gonna we were not dealt with the car and older to beat them up some more we've got the coyote is believe it or not the one team in Arizona who would've thought I was even impressed by smell like yeah I don't think the economy is going to win in Chicago after not being able to beat the Minnesota Wild who we are depleted and tired\nAnd they lost a little while but they beat the black hawk so we'll talk a little coyotes got more baseball and of course we're to talk to talk about the issue son devils who are all Sean also on national TV and this was the first time ever that the cardinals and\nThe sun devils not only played on the same day the same night and within about forty minutes of each other about thirty miles away so there was a lot of people having to decide which direction they're going to go\nAnd the cardinals were pretty much a sellout\nNot at halftime cause half the stadium laugh but honest to God dog\nSixty percent orange it looked like a Tennessee Volunteers game who happened to the orange for people that aren't as you know it was unbelievable you know they're going to play Rocky Top so how many people showed up for the ... did you get forty thousand fifty thousand how many people\nWere coming back all explained the orange thing too you know it was a horrible crowd I couldn't believe at first\nThey gave us a heads up warning and this made a lot of sense on Thursday night the students are all you know taking classes so they were in the parking garages so they were saying we were to get there earlier not even be able to get into these garages so maybe that's what happened to a lot of people I'd say that stadium\nHalf full the students came out in ... and they would do crowd shots that are always be in the students they didn't want to show all the empty seats I don't think but it was a terrible turnout terrible\nOh that's too bad well maybe some people decided mistaken I kept saying you may drive and I I you know how many people in the press box where we said you know Larry Fitzgerald staying here in Georgia in the other guys right there and go\nHey doc made the right choice you went to the issue game which leads to a six to three years so I'm at that time it was a little more competitive you know we're sitting here watching his but in some ways it was it was it was interesting to be at this ugly ugly game and see this train wreck\nAnd see all the orange and the Denver fans cheering and in a minute and the great lawn and when I was driving down from Prescott yesterday to cover this game\nI saw when I started seeing New Mexico plates I knew what they were ... their Denver bronco fans and then I saw Colorado plates and there's plenty of people that live here they move here or snow over here from Colorado so that place was packed I also heard reports that the\nAirport was full of Colorado\nDenver bronco orange callers and people have to rent a car so it was a TV modest showed it a little bit but if you were there I kept hearing it was like the bears game it was so many well our our explained it all to you about the orange when we get back but we'd better take a break\nWe'll take a break Billy play a few commercials push all the right buttons keep me pile up to eleven or so and we'll be right back with ... you got back on idol six will keep you updated on any baseball school they don't start till five thirty nine so I'll go too far we'll be right back after this\nWallet can both mortgage lending is
