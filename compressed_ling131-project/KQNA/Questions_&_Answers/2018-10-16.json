we're opening up on Sundays wonder five starting November Eighteen now this is a pilot project I'm and we're going to be collecting data on Sundays a\nDoor counts surveys from the community um of course the door accounts are very important because it's going to justify um the need to open on Sundays if we really have a good group I'm continuously coming in on Sundays\nAnd let me interrupt and say did\nYou sit in a sense that had been asking for years for us to do that yes if you don't take advantage of it\nIt will be just a pilot program correct and it ... so they're turning themselves inside out an upside down so we need to get adequate numbers in there on Sunday and now I'm asking you now to don't let me down\nAnd and that's an interesting um I get a lot of interesting comments from people that oh our libraries dead and um why I Know why why do I need to go to the library and I will tell you what last year alone we had over almost over three thousand people use me three hundred thousand people come through our\nDoors last year that's a lot of Ciro lab has a lot of the narrow and can we talk about having a public space where you're not obligated to spend money exactly and and having that freedom of place you can just be riot he's indispensable writing and library to the\nGreat equalizer not everybody can afford a computer or they can't afford why are they can't afford to download books on Amazon um there's a huge article and Forbes um a few months ago that had all of us librarians up in arms that you know just shut down the libraries and um have Amazon be the library well nobody can\nRace and um have Amazon be the library well nobody can afford to purchase these materials online that's why we have libraries here's my response ...\nIt was the response with so unnerving that Forbes remove the article and I would think yeah it was it was quite interesting and it and we were you know the community that we have up here it's really diverse\nAnd we are considered a rural library system so we do have a lot of people who come in who don't have the computers and we see that use every day with the amount of people that come in and first thing and we opened our computers are packed so it's it's it shows us on the fact also we are received a grant\nFor a wife I hotspot so we purchased twenty three why hotspots to check out to our community explain what why fi\nHotspot do so again not everybody has Internet in their house so we were able to purchase twenty three wife I hotspots that people could check out take into their home and connect to the Internet using their devices\nOr laptops or even um you know uh if you have granted if you don't have a smart TV you're you're not going to have Internet but people use the mainly for its devices\nAnd a lot of kids to don't have a Internet to do homework so it was an opportunity for them to have access to the Internet which they normally would not have it was so overwhelmingly popular\nOn that our friends in the library we couldn't keep all twenty three a hot spot open until we had to go down to ten that are friends of the library or paying for the rest of those wind my hot spots so a few friends to the library or they're yeah\nThey're amazing but these are just some of the things that you know when people say libraries are defined and that's not the case I mean we have again we've seen those numbers every day and we are where community space we're\nWe're learning space we offered GED classes citizenship classes civics classes for people to get their citizenship and librarians are such an incredible resource and the idea of taking that\nFrom the public just breaks my heart because you can always ask a librarian yes anything uh-huh\nAnd we may not know the answer but we definitely know how to find the correct answer\nAnd you know what else I heard there was an art show or their the region yes\nThere are still right in the library on my gosh that they we have paintings hanging all over the library and then uh the crystal\nWas it in the course or him yes and I just happened to purchase one of those things I'm not going to tell you which one I was so excited to see I Love all the art in the library so it's it's more than a box of books and they don't even like to say that but it's an area\nAnd it's space for people to come to meet in people from different socio economic background education and they're all equal\nI came from the valley of course I Lived in Phoenix I'm not going to tell you how many years just a lot [laughter]\nAnd\nI caught really spoil down there yes and what people don't understand rural rural community right but we do not have a typical rural library no not\nAt all clear that we're not even close yeah I when I first came up here six years ago and I walked into the building for my interview\nIt was amazing I'm ... I just couldn't believe that this library was in the middle of Prescott valley it looked like it should be in a downtown metropolitan area so not only was I made that but when I got the position\nIt and all the uh the technology they're they have a shorter a automatic sorter that checks in the book and sorts them out into their perspective areas I didn't even have that at the library that I came from\nUm we had just got our I mean the other place just got our if id which has radio frequency identification and their books and Prescott valley already had it for years so that was it's a very progressive library and that's one thing that I Want to continue to do\nHe did the laundry and the kitchen so he was amazing but yeah it's not like um you just you're hired in a library and you're in a librarian\nAnd there is a lot of training on and we keep up there's a lot of professional development on again we keep up with all the trends do you think trends in libraries yes so I thought oh my gosh and we have to keep up with the times I mean we have to keep up with our\nOur needs of our community so um yes we have an education but we always and I always stress and believe in professional development for not only myself but for that and that's why librarians are so special you're not just talking to an employee you're talking to somebody who's living their dream\nAnd ... and speaking of living in a dream I have a question what is going to happen when we finished the pilot project for being open on Sundays\nYes so thank you for getting back to that literally the pilot project is supposed to last until last until the end of April at that point I Will then present to counsel all the data that we have comments feedback and of course\nI'm you know the amount of citizens that come through the door on Sunday and I think it's going to be extremely successful I\nAnd I think it's going to be extremely successful I um granted I look at the glasses you know\nHalf full not half empty but either way um I really think it's going to take off nicely and that we are going to see the need 'em so at that point out present a council um look these are our numbers um\nAnd I think it would really be great if we continue to open on open up on Sundays um and I will say you know again this has been a lot of ... was schedules with people\nI'm not we don't have not everybody who works in libraries full time so we do have a librarians would call them the librarians in charge so they will be there on Sundays it is a rotating schedule\nUm but it it's going to stretch it's a little bit since so we're hoping that if there's a need and we showed tremendous numbers coming through the door on Sundays\nUm I Will go back to counsel and say look this is a need can we get some more staff\nThere you go [laughter] well I think\nThis is perfect opportunity to ask the favor of you Kate for certainly I Would like huge go back to your staff ... and I want you on behalf of myself and the council truth thank them for\nBringing this marvelous opportunity to citizens were otherwise wouldn't be in a library and I want you to tell them\nI personally didn't take all this disruption lightly mhm I Know that it's up turn schedules\nAre you Ari explain physically how it's turned right location yeah and I I Want your staff to now the depth of my personal appreciation on part of the whole culture on who\nYou are loved thing [laughter] and it's it I mean when I first told them um what was going to be happening that we're going to have to adjust our hours also we will um in order to adjust where there are those hours on Sunday we will be closing at seven um Monday through Thursday it's important we repeat that yeah so we are closing early\nMonday it's a Monday through Thursday at seven PM instead of our normal eight to ... eight pm to adjust for those hour and that begins November eight ... Eighteenth so then that following Monday the nineteenth we will close at seven so we'll be open Monday through Thursday nine to\nSeven well I think we covered that beautifully but I bet there are some programs available like maybe some three D. print or so some people don't even know about\nWe do we have now we have one of three D printer that we received and I'm going to be saying this a lot\nAh through and Alice TA grant which is a library services in technology act grant through um the uh to Institute a museum and library services\nUm we were to grant a couple of years back we got this great little maker bought a three D printer and um people have a smaller so it's one of the smaller printers\nBut we're able to um our teen librarian I guy came in and he um had broke apart on his Toyota ... J. J. O. J. F. chase seven and my husband goes where's the seven coming from\nSo it was a little piece that would have cost him five hundred dollars to buy from the dealership\nAnd we went on that site called Thingiverse where it has all sorts of three D. designs that people designed themselves and it's and it share everybody shares the designs\nSo shell the out Abel she was able to um\nDownloaded and she printed off this piece that fit perfectly to his broken part and this is free so we saved him five hundred dollars a year and how he for anything to use the printer what a public service right it was so awesome I and and that's happened to we have um there's a guy who comes in daily and he prints off\nI I Can't remember what he's building I owe a rocket ship so you have to build it in pieces because of the smaller maker bought on but we did purchase a larger one which is in the process of\nBeing built um we had to build up ... because it came from the Czech Republic and so um I Can't remember the name of it but yeah it was interesting and so but it's a larger one and it's it was one of the best ones out there\nSo I have to share with you both I just had a wonderful ... a parents read three printers my son who is also a grandfather\nHad been secretly at home as a hobby purchase whatever type with through the printer\nAnd he made toys for his ranch on\nThat a cynical I didn't know what a fidget tore it she didn't yes uh-huh well some of the thoughts adults said we want that one [laughter] one of them is a trend that SARS\nAnd my granddaughter um it's a supervisor in a very stressful job and she\nTook it to fidget rich when she [laughter] she and she took it and put it on all my pointing to bring that up three prisoners as you're already indicated saved an individual a lot of money you know ... yes but it brings a lot of joy oh yeah\nI've we've printed out silly things like some of the ... characters and um so yeah we have a lot of fun with it to\nWhat my son did he took a concept of ... and created toys and gifts that were actually labels\nThat he had created a hockey and they're all flexible uh-huh yup it it's\nAmazing that the things you can build with our three D printer so it's again it's it's it's wonderful service that we again offer for free what\nElse would you like your show of cases of people probably maybe even Lincoln I don't know ... you know I Would like to just kind of put a flag up on one um the audio and video appointment that you have available to kids of all ages including us grown up yet that I Want to I Want a spotlight oh yeah\nSo we have a digital media lab and we're continuously updating at a show me marks again our teen librarian she received A L a TA grant to do me a make or space so she purchased sewing machines\nAnd she had the teens yeah last week they were making book bags um one kid brought some pants in and fix pants [laughter]\nThat's ever but I was upstairs and I look down the digital media lab and I see these guys these boys teen boys using a sewing machine\nI mean my hands like boom I Can't believe than staying support ... library and but also we have besides the sewing machines we have Mac computers we have a recording equipment we have the three print or of course\nUm we have a green screen 'em the walls I mean the uh you can't see the studio inherits wall to wall carpeting here but we have um the the sound phone on the walls\nUm so and that was received through also a Alice ... grant from the um museum Institute a museum and library services through Arizona State library archives in public record\nWhat takes place in that green wall\nSo you know so you can record a movie and you can you know drop a background of you know ... maybe dinosaurs chasing you you're in the ocean you're flying it's a green screen so you can use your imagination\nThe ocean you're flying it's a green screen so you can use your imagination but\nThe tools that we have in the Mac computers that we have are amazing in there and um it it's it doesn't get his use as much as I'd like but it's I mean especially with the addition of the three D printer on it's being used at this point every day\nSo you have your own fantasy land we do [laughter] it's such a safe place to explore and try new hobby again that that pressure free use where you're not being asked to spend money and so if you'd like to go in and try all in something right and and see if it's for us\nYeah well let's go into to the point right now due to sound like our library is dead or dying no they are in law being piano\nAnd that's what last what libraries are doing 'em and it's interesting that a lot of businesses like the bookstores\nThey didn't involve a lot of ... down and so we've had two of all we've had to um you know make ourselves available community centers learning centers and again everything that we offer is for free", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Questions & Answers", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "16"}
