fortunate enough to win back the house and or the ... he can start again\nThey were great advice Hillary Clinton always ahead of the curve let's be on civil because we keep losing elections why should we actually act like mature adults why don't we screen the people in elevators and follow them around cities\nThat's the mature way to do things Hillary Clinton get she needed to reinforce the decision America Made not to make or the next president United States in so desperate to matter unbelievable\nNumber two\nI think the Democrats are putting maxed out on motivation and they've been raging for two years they're eager to vote so I think any additional motivation to get out of the cabinet fair is likely to be only a modest increase proposals on the other hand looking pretty sleepy like Kavanaugh case clearly has changed the equation there and the polling evidence which the shows that motivation among Republicans is up\nYeah so what does that mean for the ultimate clash will they keep it up for the next three and a half weeks ... human Tucker last night as a prima Kavanaugh era has been done by the way what now for Republicans and Democrats both sides both sides are ... was just telling you why I think the GOP woke up and we'll stay up\nNumber one\nShe's probably once said you know maybe at the end of the year the year period\nYou know maybe at the end of the year the other two years of areas of the end of the year I Want to take a little time off\nAnd with that people were stunned the secret was kept\nIn Washington for the last two weeks Nikki Hailey let it be

a\n[noise]\nI started wearing at his inauguration about because when he sat in his speech which I thought was\nA defiant defensive dystopian it more than a speech to bring together people who had not supporting him but instead it with and as I say in my book what happened at a you know the white nationalist and got\nWho uh what is with her why she allowed to get away with that anyone who voted forms of white nationalist peachy he got elected me as a white nationalist\nWhat is wrong with it I mean I Can't get over that she's allowed to get away with it and nobody follows up and says well I think it's wrong Hillary Clinton to label Donald Trump supporters as white nationalist [noise]\nStretch he got more African American votes not enough but more operator more votes on Romney and McCain\nAnd he is done better for minorities and joins of economic benefits I think the whole Charlottesville thing was a travesty so easily avoided\nA easy to condemn any didn't he blew it you asked me and he says in the Woodward book it said that he is quoted telling people yeah screw that up I get that but he is not shown a white nationalist tendencies nor do I think it's correct\nTo tell to tell supporters that they're white nationalist\nHere's Jeffrey tubing cut thirty seven who thinks that by the way\nThink Democrats are ... they are afraid of everything it's like oh we can't have Hillary Clinton talk because it'll motivate the Republican bank we can't have Iraq Obama talk motivate their base we can't talk about impeachment or to motivate their base you know what\nHillary Clinton got three million more votes than the other guy in two thousand sixteen I don't see why she shouldn't be campaigning around the country I don't see why Brock Obama shouldn't be campaigning sheen is an enormously\nObama shouldn't be campaigning sheen is an enormously important figure in American history she got sixty plus million votes I don't see why she shouldn't speak out a ... a different too but I understand where you're coming from you so you've got to be more aggressive\nI get that Trump is showed everybody that but Hillary Clinton is not your answer Hillary Clinton didn't get elected twice Hillary Clinton with LeBron James couldn't fill out but theater or excuse me an arena in Cleveland Hillary Clinton got more because she got more in the west coast in east coast but not in the middle and the state so you have to be delivered in\nSo she can go to certain people and raise the money usually though it raises for herself bronco bomb at the same thing about ... track record he can get himself elected but he can't get anybody else elected that's the problem\nAnd therefore people seeing that say well I don't want to his policies they respected she he can speak you know if you if you look at Bill Clinton say I don't like I'm fine but you can't say that he can't motivate and connect you could ... I don't like his policies you can't say that he's not a great speaker\nYou can't say that you can't fill up a a building\nBut Hillary Clinton cat never coach he has nothing to say there's nothing authentic\nYou know maybe a secretary of state she was affected because she doesn't have to tell anybody on anything it's out of the political arena she is not a good politician ended up story she reminds people of losing that's it\nAl Gore got more popular votes in George Bush but Al Gore's not asked to help out John Kerry because you looked at as the loser who couldn't motivate and execute and produced when you had to listen to this more from Hillary Clinton's ranch cut thirty two\nI Want to stop the the graying of the rule of law the de legitimize elections one of their priorities and me not to protect our election let's make sure that uh we had a lack of security and the precedent voters so they're having big agenda at the Democratic\nNumber one there is a movement\nOr to protect the election and so for the big story I think in the Washington Post no sign the Russians meddling in the midterms they are concerned about what's happening with China\nAnd the president called about specifically and they are much better hackers sadly then the Russians and a much bigger economic and military threat\nThan the Russians so they are concerned and the Russians got so much blowback after what they try to do in the election from Facebook adds to the people that is really hurt American U.S Russia relations to a point\nWith all these individual sanctions on rich people and now the fortifications of our our defense of Ukraine with lethal weapons that we've given them a missile defense system that's been implemented now they're realizing all we did\nWas make it impossible to have good relations so the Russians aren't playing a role we should keep everything else in mind but we're not the ... elections what are you talking about because election Judy and when you got three million more votes but as you maximize votes in\nLos Angeles and you maximize vote in San Francisco and you maximize votes in New York City\nAnd that's fine but it doesn't get you'll elections that's what I play the game you can't decide a baseball game on total hits you can't decide a football game on total yards hey we gained and we had Tyler position but what\nThe score the school was you lost a lot of states by a lot\nHere see losing your news on your six five and a window Hey Steve\nMartin Ron I Love the show man thank you ... you are listening\nTo our originally from Chicago um I don't ever remember politics spirit wherever they are terrible version of ... or ... every time somebody on their work all the shooter and I know this woman goes to another country and brush in our country come on man\nYou don't believe in both if it's unbelievable\nShe don't watch the English in a bowl and why is Christina unimportant not asking a follow up question like dangerous just walked in and say you know part of that interview that we didn't there today we're focused on with Hillary Clinton down what we were doing\nIt she says the Republicans have suppressed to twelve moved twelve million people on voter rolls sort of between twenty twelve and twenty sixteen where does she\n... she saying that they used to vote Republican and they don't anymore\nThey're off the rules they couldn't vote she claims to to me that's not true number one is what a ... point blank ask them to this cut their name on\nThe Republican have systematically cracked voter probably as many Christie on as twelve million voters were purged by Republican government\n... deal is ear naturally excuse me were that number come from him she might have it she might say well uh actually X Y Z poll says well I've never heard that before well\nThat that's his take to prevent everything twenty seven percent of the country now is that Brian ... at that time so they just use the techniques if it's in their favor right that's what pulled it's just like that Donald Trump kept saying you can't believe people can't believe the polls they were alive journalists were saying that are a lot of the late night gods who get their opinion\nBecause they said that every year when there isn't a leg or every election year they say they look at the polls and they're wrong and that's what we saw in the last election\nSee people say well Hillary Clinton you Jeffrey tube and we just played you know why can't Hillary Clinton go out there she got more of a three million more votes and President Trump no Bill Clinton won maximizing liberal states for her but that's how you do it a try and tell you what would it take to win Iowa wouldn't take to a New Hampshire what does it take to in Texas do do it and move\nBut I at the end the ... of course has now I Want to have an electoral college like you can't get rid of that convinced yes California known that if she needs to be able to\nDrive ... she's going to do anything she wants to deal with socialists World Health into her inauguration as an exercise a lot of it yeah [laughter]\nSo I Want to say on that first of all I Want to paint\nYou know allowing\nUs to come out and how how this way and then and honor and all I I you know I had I in fact\nLeave this may have rationing and from\nRarely been laughing and I want to thank you for that\nAnd you said her ... her high\nSchool yeah he goes to a high school here where a lot of the un kids go and it's very eclectic he has friends from all over the over the world and she said she was hosting a slumber party the other night for his kids and they were kids representing so many different country that was really fun and she said her son loves it\nHer daughter's at Clemson University her son is in high school here in New York and he was really excited about it and she said I'm not gonna take that position because I don't want to pull you out of high school in South Carolina he said no mom you've got to do it you've got to do it and I'll be fine and she said they moved here and he loves it\nAnd now I Know that the husband is in the military is he still station so I I don't know the answer to that Brian I Believe so and she knew what I knew when I don't know the answer\nTo make something that makes sense to make it sound by the way they automate with power and forthright okay wrapping that again\nOr do you know if ah her husband is in the military yes he's shy air force base in Sumter South Carolina great and I believe you're right I see I don't even know if that's a branch of the air force no I Believe you the first time right you're right\nYes he is in the air force so Stephen Harper is the former prime minister a conservative white who is this what the name\nStephen Harper okay okay I go to the loving the title yet\nWell he's the former Canadian Prime minister okay\nSo she or he was asked you know how effective is his Trump foreign policy with Nikki Haley in George ...\nShe was very effective in communicating very different American approach to foreign policy you say an unorthodox one also one that you know was not an easy one to deliver what she did it in a way that I think got her respect and was effective and\nYou know there's there's often a it's often position that the president to take the stronger position on foreign affairs most somehow inherently disagreeable and I think she showed that you can be respected and be very effective well delivering messages that a lot of people don't want to hear\nThat was even opera would be the person who's got
