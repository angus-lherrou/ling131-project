church going place with if not a denominational agreement at least a general agreement on the dignity of the individual I think it was a safer place\nYeah I agree and what a ... a hearty amen to that Louis club first of all it it was so much of what we're doing in life is consuming in shorter and shorter hot takes right now and that means we have less and less was up\nI mean there is actually lots of data showing Americans are reading significantly less than Thirty years ago if everybody were reading Lewis like that or even lion the witch and the wardrobe or or\nThe weight of glory and other s as\nThere is so much weight there that starts from that assumption\nOf a modern day so to the Judeo Christian traditions the assumptions that people are created in the image of God and they have that he sold humans holes are immortal and so if you treat people like that\nIt means that even if I differ with somebody on policy and there's lots of legislative priorities and policies that you're going to differ with your neighbors about\nThat doesn't change the fact that there are human worthy of dignity created in God's image and ... a descendent of a line before that baby the parents to align that's coming after that and if my neighbor for doors down and I for completely on this in my view the stupidity of a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and all the economic destruction that will cause\nThat doesn't change the fact that we're going to root for the Oscars together and I'm going to sweep their kid up in my driveway if she skins are neat falling off the bike like that not that go\nAhead and that is though that is the rediscovery of community but now applying for me senators asked to a problem which I've been talking about all morning there's seven thousand human beings marching towards our border they are human beings they are embargo day they they deserve dignity but at the same time our laws cannot be kept him to the mob\nYou can't march into America and if seven thousand people can next time it'll be fourteen thousand then I'll be fifty thousand\nHow do you want to frame what we ought to do about this for the public\nYeah so let's go back and and this is not a you know just trying to blame the prior administration because I Want to be clear our immigration problem started decades and they called that\nHuge part of this problem is in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen when we didn't send a clear signal and Central America that the assumptions that people and especially bad people I mean they don't have the\nImage of God that we can distinguish what we have more time between the illogical right just as a civil justice but human traffickers are in Central America told people they told moms and dads when they were trying to take big payments out of them\nTo say we can get your kids into the U.S they told them that the US's catch and release policy in twenty Thirteen fourteen meant that if you've got to the border you were basically guaranteed admission and passage into the U.S\nThe U.S has to half borders every nation has to have borders and if you're going to secure your border that means you willing to stop the upstream or in this case downstream the goals\nThat are telling people our policies are so dumb that if you can get to the border and turn yourself into a border patrol agent we can't pet process the backlog and civil immediately just release these migrants straight into the U.S and they'll have a six month the path until their trial date and some super majority of them I don't know the current statistics\nBut a hefty percentage of them don't ever show up for their trials that are for their deportation trial that was stupid and now we have a big problem because these assumptions have been set for so long\nWe need to send a signal that the U.S this border is hard and getting harder and needs to be hard and more and that you won't get in under the dumb catch and release policy\nAnd at the same time we need to make sure that the ways that we communicate that continue to articulate the US's grand division of seven and a half billion people being created with dignity that doesn't mean you get free passage in the United states of America\nThe fence must be the outward expression of an invisible resolved to both control your border but be a welcoming country and let me play for you and as we talked a lot senator during the confirmation of justice cabin up\nChuck Todd on meet the press on friday has been all over the country doing what I'm doing doing meet and greets with voters whose conclusion ... number for\nMy travel this week [noise]\nAnd then when I was on the record\nIs amazing how can that some of them were people running ... some of them were people voting although we're going\n\nWashington Democrats messed up some of them went by a man named Jack and these are Democrats out campaign trail frustrated that cap it off\nSo Ben Sasse why the Rick oil I think Chuck is right I've heard the same thing it's in the polling there's a window if the Republicans back what is it about those proceedings the cause of America to shutter\n[noise] well I I I'm going to be delicate about this because I I think the backdrop is the gender gap in America now thirty five no I'm no I'm you know I'm trying to think ooh my ... my favorite ... at the moment as unbearable bowling expert but when you have the gender gap a plus thirty five\nUm historically Republicans usually trial you know for ten point\nA witch when um when you have plus twenty five with women and now for Democrats and now a plus for teenage ah for Republicans with Ben sometimes just fundamentally broken in the country so there's a lot to say that isn't just about the cabin Iraq's um but I think in the cabinet hearings\nYou saw an attempt to politicize and hijack the me too movement and bake it something that is owned by partisans in Washington DC I'm I think the beach a movement is incredibly important 'cause I Do think we have a culture of a lot of sexual violence in this country and I think the beach in movement is on a very good\nViolence in this country and I think to be true but but it's on that a very good thing\nBut I think you saw in the cabin I hearing an assumption that politicians can just grab any cultural movement and do what they want with it\nAnd the reality is we have a long\nTradition and the British and American legal tradition of rights not just a user but of the accused\nAnd there were people talking rhetorically around the cabin on hearings like there's no such thing as a write up the accused and I think I'm ... moms and dads don't want that for their son spin on sexual violence for their daughters that they want a world where there's a lot more cautious deliberation that was that was happening in that media circus\nA very quick I could a senator in my case it says to justice love kind as ... with your God that's kind of internalized and every question America and Jews as well I don't think kindness was on board and justice was certainly not present in that Senate proceed\nNo you're right I mean the the the big gap there where politics and politics for instance TV\nUm happens like that for so many people who are the politically adept at class of watching that is because I think and again why I wrote the book than of of upstream things that are happening where a digital revolution is undermining combat community the nuclear family is in statistical collapse that America\nDeep friendship has been cut in half in the last twenty seven years in America job to ration is getting shorter local worshipping communities are declining or becoming so large that their suburban commuter campuses all of that undermining of place and stick relationship inevitably undermines our ability to think about our neighbor as whole people\nNot just partisans on the other side of the political Lyle politics are important but if it's the senator life something is

headlines before the midterms Michael good ones here my crew in a fascinating comments on Fox News dot com I think it's there it's on the front page right now and on the New York post Michael why do you believe what you're hearing now is somebody who is preparing for for a rematch\nWell run just to clip you played as is one of many examples of I've been writing for months and often you know people say you're crazy but I've been writing for months that she wants to run and that each of these things there's another little sign another little step into the arena\nAnd I think you're seeing more and more I Want to the midterms turn she and her husband are going on this speaking tour for six months seven hundred bucks at the high end too yeah\nBut that's true but to me I think the main thing is she's going to be out there the two of them are going to be out there to their way of keeping her name front and center out while all the other candidates scrambled to put together their teams instructor raise money she going to be ahead of them again\nAnd I think she's been sitting there thinking who can beat me who among the Democrats can beat me in primaries\nAnd you think that President Obama could step up and say step inside he'll review or you're too old and you lost\nHe could but still who is the alternative I think that's the question and until somebody emerges she is something of the default incumbent in that position of being the nominee I locate us\nBrian who can lead the party who couldn't unite them around the ... a message to account divided the Democrats are there may be twenty people running in twenty twenty or justice President Trump a in sixteen how all of those are Republican opponents little by little he started with a small base a little by little\nHe gained traction he got his base up to twenty twenty five thirty thirty five\nAs everybody dropped out he gained more and more I think you could see something like that with Hillary Clinton a war of attrition where she starts with the biggest base and grows it as they all drop out\nSo you know you do point out some things that I read the New York times editorial section essentially was critical of her yeah to Vanity Fair wrote an article saying that she didn't learn the lessons of need to be his right to kill us answer\nAbout did your husband or your husband have resigned after his affair lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky sorry it's who was she was an adult much would it terrible answered that is\nWhat is technically illegal but that's but that's the Clintons they're never going to change I mean that is the thing they never really changed show would you a\nChronically needs to push back on the left nuts on the right the right would be high fiving if she ran again used Murray Harper worked for John Kerry said\nI think that she had become a distraction I had a ... for many of the things she done in her life and her career but if her goal is to help the Democratic party immediate chore comments particularly about me too and sexual assault\nIt's just not helping it is a distraction at a time white Nineteen days out from the ... democratic candidates are looking to the future not the past and she is the past\nI think that's a that's a very good point that Maria ... makes but she's also talking about the limited terms that\nYou see is a distraction to the midterms\nAnd I think that is all of those all of those women who wrote those articles that you cited two or three of them\nThey also basically are complaining that she is a distraction\nAgainst the party's candidates in the midterms that'll be over soon enough then we'll turn to twenty twenty almost immediately the field will start to take shape at that point she will not be a distraction\nShe will be one of many people I think she but she's going to do it in her own way look she may have health problems that surface\nAt some point I spoke to President Trump my interview with him or two weeks ago\nHe said he thought that she did not have the mental or physical stamina to do it\nUm I don't know if she does or doesn't but I think she's getting ready to run I think she's gonna she's preparing herself she's positioning herself\nAnd I think she wants to ... we know Brian she wants it more than anybody alive right\nWhat is it Bob Dole Al Gore John Kerry John McCain have in common and Mitt Romney they lost\nThe show's great deference and they stepped aside the needs something house she isn't capable of showing any class absolutely is selfish really great point one meal the\nI don't want to put you in a bad spot and you were kind enough to join us ... ... what the us here here's I Want you to hear this have you comment for Haiti Waldman of homeland security uh was kind enough to come on with us friday and she has this dates back to two thousand nine listen what happened\nThen made the ... ah they they made politicians think central and south Americans were more important than Mexicans\nAnd take it out and eat law written by Dianne Feinstein that tree in Canada Canada and Mexico different than a tree and Central American because back in two thousand eight and a military apprehension\nFor all Mexican now they're all predominantly Central American shocking when you look at it at the hundred thousand family in at apprehended last year from El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras nearly Ninety nine percent of them were made in that country today\nSo at that time and it's all pretty much that's four hundred thousand apprehension is we cannot repatriate and barely won ... put a cow in the United states we cannot just send them right back\nSo that's the reality you your country is not the problem\n[noise] ... I I think you know listening to what you just played\nMy comments would be the formal in just a few days circle Mexico into the United states coke convene a conference gearing Washington\nA including the ... northern cry concrete sense out of our own Buddhist and walk them out and ... was very clear about that meeting which Mexico and the U.S participated were it was that we need to work\nOn a you know regionally on a two track approach one we must shores that development\nIs better on those on Greece\nSo people are not forcing immigration decision\nAnd I also grew all lost mostly in fourth I was a main conclusion in the end the only long term solution to this is making sure that there's development in this country and the United states his work at stores our goal as well as Mexico and Central American countries\nBut at the same time we cannot obviously um look the other way to the fact that a ... or ... and ... that is a ... in my view that the protests will change things I guess everything is going on is just a um you know ... it really a call ...\nTo a step up the pace to find long term structural solutions to this phenomena and that is precisely what we're working for\nAbout two so you're saying if they want to stay in Mexico they say in Mexico but they just want to come here do you guys have laws and rules when it comes to refugee status or gas workers status or\nYes we do we do have both things we do have gas workers styles and we do have a a refugee status are ordering to our own immigration laws on the international law and in fact Brian about at least around a thousand people\nOr how to self gifts that he had already requested refugee status in Mexico and I was the intent\nA and we will continue to do so and that's why we call on the guy at the office or the high commissioner of the United nations on refugees to help Mexico in this process so which transparent it's clear it respects human rights says he'll holes that role\nAnd it's an important challenge August but I think we will be able to handle that\nCorrect yeah I Know you don't want to comment but there's some message that we're giving to Central Americans in those tribal countries\nTo make them think now more than ever\nNow over the last eight years more than ever did they feel as though they can come in and not to beat the system and can stay you heard that that that's an American executive American a federal government worker a spokesperson for homeland security who said that Ninety nine percent of the people coming in or not Mexican\nSo there's some message there were giving that's being misinterpreted were they know our laws better than anybody else now let me ask you a quick question about the wall when I look at what happened when I see the wall be ineffective in Israel when I see the well being an effective in hungry\nWhen I saw how effective the Berlin Wall was a because for the wrong reasons when the iron curtain dropped\nThey controlled movement\nWe have seven million open jobs here nobody wants to shut down immigration we just want to control our borders why does Mexico take that personally\nI I Would first of all Mexico understood in some respects the right over the United States I've bought off any concrete to protect its borders centered and force of law and I want to make that very clear\nAnd where in fact have a very strong corporation agenda with the chess and all the authorities in the U.S we don't see eye to eye on everything and\nYou know the United states has the right to protect its course and we don't question if you ask because we were you know you're friendly neighbor we would say perhaps that's not the best way to go and we have made that very clear\nAnd I think that's several analysts have pointed out to the fact that there are you know perhaps better ways to a secure our\nBorder and we have a very comprehensive agenda with United States from dot regard um so that's that's pretty much where we are we you know we as as neighbors ... some friends who you know it was on an issue we\nAre and I understand that but it it says something about a wall that bothers you I mean there are communities that don't want fences with my community everybody's got a fence but you don't take it personal if we could control our borders it'll make your southern border more defensible\nBrian we're again we're not against any country forcing and protecting its borders a and the fact that it was personal because uh you know why why Mexico in general does not appreciate that\nThis ... is ... is because it has been in some instances a couple with a narrative that is very offensive to Mexicans uh Mexicans are hardworking people\nAbsolutely by you know have\n... you know they're liable to be\nA you know by people in a big group that's obvious okay but um if you do it generalization in that regard you will go on to offend all of Mexico\nAnd let me give you an example but you know being bombed in previous administrations more than you know five hundred miles of fence as were built yeah but they were not coupled\nWith a narrative that was offensive to our country and that it's important so we hope we have a good dialogue with the Trump Administration yes we do have differences but we believe that crew corporation on ... we saw those differences as we just don't let the creator and that is precisely why we're going to put you to go\nUh pride matters so I understand that um and hopefully people will get that point across but when you see how many jobs we had when you\nAnd hopefully people will get that point across but when you see how many jobs we had when you talk to farmers and I'm not I'm not saying all Mexicans are Central American should be working on a farm I'm not generalizing but a lot of them do\nAnd seven million jobs are open farmers are desperate for a guest worker program it seems like we just can't get out of the blocks and war and we will have some simple problems\nI agree wholeheartedly with you I I think for example and we kept discussions with us from ... in that regard that for example the age to a pizza program which allows temporary work a ... year\nShould probably be reviewed an updated in a way that it's more a it's more simple and more effective uh let me tell you something Mexicans don't have a cheap rent that event that\nYou know goes to ... go and you know break the law and entered the United states um if there are sufficient and simple legal avenues\nI think that people will choose shows the alive and that's about ... and I understand I understand that this is a very cents on the ice at Easter politically the United states and work extremely rich ...\nBut it you know they you know a thoughtful discussion about how to fix the immigration system including you know discussion with Mexico we'll end up\nHelping India's both called our demographics are complimentary and as you just had I had sat down with the X factor people for you know the last month and they feel that they need a lot of people in order to have all the jokes\nThat same happened with the uh for example um construction business so they can be a window ... gone grease yeah and and we should work on that I'm Glad I see it right this is talk Fisher Brian\n... of the you know the story of our country you know when the Irish first came over they were building the railroads and when the Italians first came over they were they were working their way up but you know up the ladder it happens it through that's the history of America you have your own history as well but I got to just back I before I let you go and I know you're busy\nJust on this four thousand to seven thousand people that are coming towards a border do you do the Mexican authorities have one last stand before they get to Texas Arizona New Mexico or or California\nWhat I Will let you know it was a Mexican authorities will make sure that everybody ... is complying with Mexican immigration law and that it's only a it through that way that they could come in\nAnd we will continue to follow this situation our it's ... it's not to have anybody break the law of the United states are much\nRight uh I mean who's really know where to stop and uh and that sort of get enough I I look forward to the dialogue between ... between the countries\nThat circling the benefit of the ...\nWhen we come back your phone calls one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine you're listening to the brain to meet ya have spry and kill made [noise]", "year": "2018",
