the the the comparisons I think the inevitable comparison is with the Roseanne Barr situation you've got Roseanne Barr one tweet your route fire you've got Megan Kelly one Ninety second conversation\nBoth of course you had to do with race but in both cases it seems to me that it's impossible to believe that it was that one statement or comment or act\nThey could get used to superstars fired from the the two of the major networks in America could it be that\nRace is just the third rail you can't touch rage that all in any way shape or form and you can't be politically incorrect on the subject of race and if you are you're out\nOr could it be that Roseanne Barr was the Trump support the Megan Kelly came over from Fox News and had some\nConservative views on policing on race and other things could be that she wasn't the right kind of person to\nShe wasn't the right kind of person\nTo be the NBC world now ABC justify Roseanne that's their their candy store NBC gets to fire Megan Kelly is is there can't be sure Megan Kelly is a rich woman Roseanne or ritual it's not it's not a matter of of the of trying to preserve their finances\nBut isn't it an interesting thing that this happens in a climate where politically we are back and forth at each other's throats and people on CNN and MSNBC can call the president Hitler they could call Republicans Nazis\nThey can call us all kinds of awful things regularly and that's all right if if the if the wrath comes from the left there's no problem with that\nIf it's somebody who supports Donald Trump or somebody who made her bones at and got her chops in broadcasting at a place like Fox News\nNow you're gone doesn't matter how many times you apologize\nAnd it fascinates me that there are some issues for which apologies don't matter race must be one of them when it comes to ABC NBC CBS whatever\nYou know there could be I mean Megan Kelly as the back story goes\nWhich I don't watch I've never seen her ... I've never once seen her show I I've I've known begging over the years been on her show a lot and in fact\nI've been written about a lot in the history of of the Megan Kelly show a lot of people said I helped kind of pulled her to start up it's a bitch bizarre how it happened Chris Wallace from Fox News were joking around one day about maternity leave Megan was off I was a\nI've met a lot of appearances on Megan show years ago on Fox News\nAnd I made a joke is I often joked with Chris Wallace about maternity leave [laughter] what a racket that is for ladies that old vegans offer\nFourteen weeks or whatever boy men do get maternity leave it was just a couple of guys joking around and came back she came back from maternity leave the day she had she came back she had me on his gas to talk about some political ...\nAnd then she surprised me\nContrary to what she wrote in her book by the way that I I knew that she was going to ask me about it because I did not but that's okay it was all in good fun and she blasted be ah for talking about maternity leave\nAnd then that got that went viral and a lot of people view that and if the narrative became looked at how Megan Kelly stands up to a conservative big mouth like Mike Gallagher she's tough she scrappy\nAnd every time they wrote about it from Vanity Fair there I was always in there with that time that she yelled at me about maternity leave now again it was really kind of in good fun and I was shocked when she wrote in her book and it's just a minor point but\nShe called me a good guy in her book and she said that it it it it was a reflection of how what a good person I Am\nThat I knew she was going to ask me about it on air and I came on the show anyway well I guess I'm not that good a person because I wasn't briefed at all or perhaps she was going to ask me it was I was blindsided by it which is fine I I mean that's\nI get blindsided every time I go to a caller such okay but I thought that was a little bit interesting I don't know to this day if she really thought I was told or if she\nWas deceptive in and talking about that story\nBut in any event I've always liked her she's always been nice to me and\nAh you know I Wish your well it's just a very interesting dynamic that again that third rail seems to be in America race it's got to be about if you if you make a mistake on race it as a capital

majority leader Kevin McCarthy is office in Bakersfield had a giant Boulder thrown through the glass\nA window we've seen Mitch McConnell and his wife harassed in restaurants I'm ... and ... and and and knew this was coming from the top you got Democrat leaders encouraging people to get in Republicans faces draw a crowd chased him out I mean the words suction unhinged time\nThat uh I got to believe this bodes well for us to November the six because a lot of Americans Republican independent maybe even Democrats are saying the only way to to stop this from continuing is to put to keep Republicans in power because if these guys are in control heaven help us\nWhile I I Do think that the uh the whole notion of jobs not mobs or in the whole notion of how the former attorney general say when they're down kick them right or I think for most Americans that's just way too much yeah and so I Do think in that sense that there's a\nA substantial push\nUnderway uh and and I think that being if he said to me it was just really the country do you want to become a and you look at this mob coming up from Central America and there's no other way to describe it is it's just an invading force or at least seven thousand and\nUh somebody will see just the last night that there is another couple of thousand coming out of Guatemala now to join next so it may well be ten or twelve thousand before long ah and he said if you will\nYou really want to live in a world where these people believe they can come and impose on you or whatever they want\nAnd I think the Democrats are real bind\nI

crowd roared with approval and then I followed that up with a clip from Don Lemon over at CNN who was literally just mortified\nOr at the word nationalist and he kind of conflated he seemed to tie in nationalist with I'm white nationalist white supremacist because you said the word nationalism is is a national TV\nAnchor host well nationalist as racist overtones anti Semitic overtones bigotry show I guess we're now in a place with the left where if you say you believe in America is sovereignty and you believe that America is the greatest nation on earth and you want\nTo make America First as an American you're nothing but a stone cold bigger\nThat that is the modern left the modern laughs loyalty is to some kind of vague global assume that the president's speech at the United nations was brilliant and the first really solid defense of\nAmerica as a patriotic foreign policy since the Nineteen twenties and and he drew the real distinction\nOr do you want an American government worries about America if you have this ... says the smog coming up from what number from from Central America\nRamming should the U.S government to decide that we want to take care of the entire planet and if that means that we bankrupt America we eliminate are free to destroy our prosperity but at least we met that John Lennon standard of all the\nYou know caring about the globe which was what ... what I always said that John Kerry well you have to be given the past because\nHe was actually the global secretary of state and that's why he can continue to meet with the Iranians\nBecause he doesn't represent American policy\nAnd and the Obama administration was I think the first overtly global ... administration overhead and their view was that the United states was at the the weaker the United states was the better\nYeah but I but I have a theory too and I want to try this this out on you I don't believe Don Lemon\nOr any of these guys on the left in in the media the advocacy media is trying to stop the Trump agenda they don't believe\nThat Americans who believe who who feel the way we feel about the sovereignty of our country proudly saying you you better believe were nationalist they don't believe we are racist they don't believe we're big and they they don't they don't read the semi it's just a way to chill the debate\nNo books and they believe that they believe all those bad things about you if you say nothing\n[laughter] just just by existing\nBy existing you just can't says in the French to them and they said this one in the same kind of pressure at Georgetown a

that feminists should stand watching them choked to death and then cut off their penises and feed them the hearts and she was literally a tweet from a professor at Georgetown\nWhile that that is that that's that that that's the range\nWhich leads people to throw a Boulder to Kevin McCarthy's office window that's been a range which leads people to think that they can go into a restaurant and verbally abuse the majority leader he was Senate whose wife by the way it was the secretary of transportation and she was with them for dinner that night\nWe need to understand you have a brown shirts

back\nBut you but you can't do it in a vacuum and you can't do it while ignoring the things that are of impacting millions and millions of Americans these policies achievements that we as conservatives had been dreaming about for decades\nWell I think first of all these people don't care about the evidence may have made a judgment that they have to find their life around is the worst thing that could happen to them will be for Trump to be a great success because\nThey are dedicated to believing that he has to fail\nAnd of course you know use but you see this I mentioned earlier

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and his wife\nJust days before the bomb scare you at spoke with Senator Ben Sasse recently on to the book\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal\nSenator what did you make a bad audio I'm sure you've seen the tape or Nancy Pelosi was also assaulted this weekend what do you make of this\nYet to what end what are these people think their goal is because\nA ... right now there are so many people who are allowing their political passions to swallow up everything else in their lives that they're thinking it's normal to just scream of people at a restaurant throw their food on the table there's not a question about whether or not your First Amendment rights allow you to protest they certainly do\nBut America starts with a fundamental assumptions about what the good life is\nAnd we don't think that power is the end power as a means to maintain order so that people can have\nDinnertime discussion and debate with family and friends and even people they don't agree with everything but shut and people down in a restaurant and throwing their food on the floor or or doing what folks diplomacy it I think we're headed to a dark place and I think there are a lot of political addicts out there that are not really check it reaches the great four and five yet\nA centers as you are written a brand new book them which I Want to talk about it my copies in Virginia but I'll still talk to you about it but I Do believe in that tape you heard part of the problem I'm going to sell it\nTo ... um we had to monetize confrontation we've actually made it profitable and a path to celebrity\nTo be a jerk and to yell and scream at people I don't know that the people as you say I thought three and four and five moves that because that's a path that goes towards ever increasing confrontation\nYeah well said I I I really do think we we haven't we don't have a shared understanding across three hundred twenty billion of the\nOf the moment in which we're living both in media consumption and media maybe as a subset of technology more broadly I think the big tension and our bowl but that would be useful for us to reflect on it and a lot of why I wrote the book them is the tension between ruthlessness and rudeness\nOr the happiness literature is showing us something that you know sort of thoughtful people and get people who had grandparents than older wisdom in their life has probably known for millennia but there are about four things that Dr happiness you have a nuclear family you have a couple of friendship you have meaningful work shirt vocation and co workers and do you have a local worshipping community\nThose four ingredients are basically what Dr whether or not or happy that's all the all that stuff is about ... and our technology is allowing\nAll the all that stuff is about ... and our technology is allowing us to start to think of ourselves as completely ... and the way that we are consuming media the way that we're thinking about political tribalism is a function of that sort of the of the mindset you're right there\nI'm sure you read David Brooks his column the rich white civil war last week based on the hidden tribes study and it is in fact not a problem of the center it was a problem of the extremes on the left and right\nThat the cuts that we want to kind of pull abuse at each other but it also one that is powered by ... and I'm Wondering senators asked what do you think of an anonymous comments and the tenor they bring to our politics\nYeah great great flags on both points so first of all I think that the study you refer to hit tribes is great every your list or do read it a David Brooks in their country early last week with one of the summaries of it and one of the things that you said that so really it is when you take a park so these demographers and social scientists tried to look at America\nAnd figure out where are we on politics and so often we just think of it as right versus left\nBut there is another dimension which is\nIntensity of thinking that politics should crowd out the rest of life on the second or third most conservative voter and the U.S about it but I'm a huge skeptical about the idea that you can put politics at the center of your life and actually\nLive well and love your neighbor well what what Brooks like was two of the seven tribes that are identified in that study it Dr two of the stuff that that are most politically it that that are the eight percent on the far left the pay constant attention to politics\nThat are rich and the white and the six percent on the far right the pay constant attention to politics the rich and white and eighty six percent of America is saying go away you people are weird politics as a means to an end so that I can\nCoach little league and living my local community and this idea that politics should crowd everything else out it's it's wrong or it's never been an American idea and right now a huge part of what we are going through um is that fourteen percent telling the eighty six percent you're weird that you want to live in communities the eighty six percent or right\nAs America inches closer to

marijuana\nWe it's hard to gauge how many years actually had a problem I I smoked pretty regularly for more than two decades and I would say at least the last Fifteen Years or so I I overdid it so a long time\nHow do you know you over did it\nWell now that I'm Silber I can look back on some of the uh money have years when I was high and realize that that was causing a lot of my problems you know I was having a public meltdown even temper tantrums even uh getting into fights\nOr I was doing crazy stuff in public that I probably wouldn't have done if I'd been sober you know and I also\nWas sleeping normally and and in addition to that I spent a lot of my time\nThinking about marijuana about how to get it about how to consume that about the consumers with about trips I could take that would revolve around marijuana and you know it's just kind of became the center of my life for very long time\nAnd this was during a period of time when you were making a pretty good career for yourself as a writer you you've been married for a while right\nHas been married for Eighteen years and I have a son and the whole time I was telling me that was a you know basically like a

affairs but we made it more efficiently and I also just would have been able to devote more time to my family\nHow long how long have you been sober\nMy one year anniversary is November eleventh\nAnd what advantages do you see now the chair and non smoking pot on a regular basis\nYou know it's kind of horticulture quantify because\nIn some ways marijuana was a creative force in my life I with a you know I wrote almost all my book I all the time and I I Can't although in retrospect there there's a lot of there are a lot of scenes in the novels that are about getting caught I think there'll be fewer of those but you know it it it helped me come up with certain fancy indecent jokes\nAnd he was a creative stimulant in some ways but\nUh so I've actually been I Would say like in some ways less creative since I stopped smoking pot but\nEverything else in my life is so much better I mean I'm just I'm more present for my family and my friends I feel like my life is in order professionally in a way that at work which\nIs not as much chaos and I'm and most importantly I'm not having the emotional highs and lows that it's happening when I was using marijuana so I'm not having those melt down

in fact you know she says the opposite does she she has no interest in it at all um and she many many times tried to tell me that I had a problem I was just\nYou know I Would just shovel or off I you know 'cause the the myth is that marijuana is an addictive it in some ways it's considered a health food um and so I just you know even though I had a history of alcoholism and my family\nUm and
