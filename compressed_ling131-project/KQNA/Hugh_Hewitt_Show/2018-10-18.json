are saying that this is one of the most important decisions how he handles this will be one of the most important decisions that President Trump makes because\nYou can can you just let it ... if if this was involved at the highest levels how do you just let them get away with it and if you have to do something what is it that you do because you've got in the overall a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of\nA military arms deals are going with Saudi Arabia that means tens of thousands of jobs for companies like Lockheed and Northrop Grumman and Gracie on and and Boeing\nAnd then there is a you know a greater trade relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia the president said the overall value of the deals that they signed last year was four hundred and fifty billion dollars and then you have to have Saudi Arabia's cooperation and the war on terror you've got to have them standing as a bulwark against the Iranian\nExpansionist um I'd ideas\nAnd and then you've got this idea of oil everybody says well you know America's mayor become the number one oil producer in the world\nYou know that's that may be all well and good but you shut down the Saudi oil supply and you watch how fast the price of gas a gallon type ... how fast the price of gallon of gasoline job so it's a very very important relationship and uh how the president deals with is he's he's going to have a very very difficult needle to thread\nRight I mean if he came out today by the way of bringing up relations and no one would push back on the Republicans are upset Democrats are upset Corker came out right away and said the guy's dead and ... it's time for the prince to step aside princes don't usually do that I studied a lot of print tech a pretty good\nI think the chances of all I have been Solomon stepping aside and prints naive suddenly becoming the crown prince again I I think is highly unlikely\nYou look for the president went after me to take a Tuesday bump a oh to make a statement on this today\nTom if not the president or it may be possible for ... to come out and say something he did come out the other day and say something\nOr after he had had a meeting with the president so or ... we'll see as as always our Brian you'd never know what's gonna happen with this White House I mean the president woke up this morning that threatened to put the U.S military on the southern border to close it if Mexico didn't do something about this caravan of of Hondurans which seems\nAwfully conspicuously timed considering we're three weeks away from the mid term elections so I'm\nGetting a somewhere that Venezuela actually might be behind is is that what you're hearing\nGuy I don't know yet I don't know\nDo you want to just go agree with me makes me sad\nYou know I have like I could I could I could do that and probably be pretty safe ground\nOr you could say it's impossible at this point a to a John what's on the agenda today\nWhat can the president woke up this morning and drove the news cycle by saying that he might put the U.S military on the southern border to close that if a rise go doesn't do something about this Honduran\nCara but he's going to Montana right\nHo that yes he's going to Montana and then he's going to Arizona [noise] ah and then after that is going to Nevada so I you know he's he's got to be away from the White House for three days but even when the president is away there's still a ton of news coming out of here so ah we we can't afford to be away for a second Bryant Wright\nSomebody else who's raising the John Roberts family uh I mean I Would I\nWould be coaching my son's little league baseball team but unfortunately\nRight came out and play because of the president that's a new ad for the Democrats can't play sports bags on Robert thicker alright uh that was an interesting hit I think John regrets taking the making the goal am I right I'm pretty sure\nWhen we come back to your calls one eight six six for all eight seven

not get away with it you could think of the responsible I think it's accurate Fred lieutenant K. J. J. in uh in Arizona Fred\nHow are you doing Brian gray hey I agree with the previous caller I mean you have to look at this from a purely analytical basis who benefits from the instability between us and the ... and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nThere are many enemies of states who are very happy with the situation we're very close with people in Saudi Arabia\nHey you know what I Would love bread you know what I Would love I Love Saudi Arabia to deny it\nWell you know I Would say what they say you know maybe ... here's my point is that you have to say who benefits from where I was MPs benefit from out

probably does passively does uh I'll have a full report on that from Mike when he comes back for that that's one of the things we're going to be the first question I asked\nYou up a so he's holding his cards like you are Fred but when Lindsey Graham came in and he knows he's on the armed services gets a lot information as well as tapped into the White House said this how\nDo I engage Saudi Arabian when India the de facto leader of the country and spray and it's disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nNow here's Bob Corker\nWe've had our alliance with sound much look it's a it's going to be usually damaged and uh I Know that Congress there at the lowest
