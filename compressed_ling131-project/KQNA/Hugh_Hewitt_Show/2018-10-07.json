senator Joni urge to Iowa\nWhat have you been hearing well I Am hearing of course a mixture of the calls I get to the office a lot of them are are saying get\nKavanaugh firearms and then there are others that um are you know adamantly opposed way the those folks on the TV all the time I'm like what I Do hear when I'm Out and about and people just can't understand\nWhy we haven't moved on with\nGetting him confirmed they understand that he has the right credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done sound\nI Want to review a few things with you about the testimony\nFirst of all there was a story in Politico that she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be the way she never actually thought better itself but that was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she's familiar with polygraph said never discuss sexual assault\nThere they knew real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows that was not about claustrophobia but at second entrance for an office there wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either\nAnd then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report\nI simply do not believe that that testimony could duck Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I Do honestly believe that she has experienced trauma at some point and so do I sure do I I I think most folks would agree with that However I'm not even a witness says that she taught for word\nActually at camp corroborate or simply hair down that that testimony that she gave about um some party that she had to attend to add tell unfortunately for her I don't\nFind that can be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think Shakespeare and trauma that I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge cabin on who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not moving\nOh I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me telling the fourteen year old they will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have not stood up\nTo a to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is that none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse was allegation was libel was slanderous immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\n[noise] well I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put\nThrough um the the worst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and and discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up\nBe nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office and it simply takes an accusation and unproven accusations which can put a family literally Israel how\nJust look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance and ask about what can we stop and\nPut it in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way to stop\nThem from doing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our economy and how strongly are doing right now and and now thanks to our counterparts\nAcross the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it as as stopping the tax cuts and JOBS Act what ever it is\nThey try and LA LA recess\nUm and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that from\nThe disheartening spectacle that it's taking place in the United states some very good news came out of mid week\nThe new trade deal was filing side with Canada several weeks following and siding with Mexico to the United states in Mexico kind of agreement for us MCA\nUs MCAA will replace them which dates back to the mid nineties Larry Elder joined us even more of the Heritage Foundation will pick up their interview with more\nThis huge victory for Donald Trump I mean we've got a new NAFTA modernized now the by the way I I always thought that there was a pretty good thing I mean it unified our North American continent or Canada Mexico and the United states and needed to be modernized there were a lot of things in them out there that were out of date and were unfair and you know Trump\nHad a big victory here first she got Mexico to sign on and then he's tighten the screws on Canada and they made some real concessions here Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make and now they're sets up very nicely\nFor negotiating you know the big big deal is going to calm the hopefully with China because they they are the worst uh you know abusers of the trade wise in on the planet\nOne other quick thing Larry I was there yet the rose garden when Donald Trump has passed down from one of the points you made\nAs he said look I Want to use these tariffs has a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their tariffs on us and I have to say you may not agree with a tactic but boy is it working because these countries are reducing their care or\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says that NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries and the University of Chicago survey of calming down Ninety six percent of greed or strongly agree that on average Americans\nHave been better off with NAFTA than the previous trade deals so when President Trump keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI Do it you know and I told them I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped draft now they're back in Nineteen Ninety three or Ninety four when we originally pastor when Bill Clinton was president and we got the Republicans in Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this was the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the U. S. M. C. A. when I got a call now from any longer but it is a new on North American trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries\nIt is modernized because America has a better deal and uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is it a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing a minimum wage out another country right and that's one of the things I don't like about this the also got me on that one that's not you know we we went to Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of\nOut of business so that that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan show I'm going to agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this bill lower tariffs and barriers are up for a candidate has imposed against us and Louis ... and ... and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just otherwise just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of you know as
