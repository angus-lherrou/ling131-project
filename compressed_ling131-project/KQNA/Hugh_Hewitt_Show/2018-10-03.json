agree with that\nI I agree uh because I think I'm In these red states that President Trump carried a I think uh uh I think the judicial I mean I'm sure I'm I think the Senate candidates incumbents running or looking at their own polls in our polls are confirming what Lindsey just said\n... as the national Republican Senatorial Committee come back and confirmed that to\nA duck Cory Gardner who's the chairman this year as a as ... as basically confirmed\nThat you know I think something very big ... going on and I've been doing this show since two thousand I've been doing radio since Nineteen Ninety nothing compares to the visceral rejection of McCarthyism directed\nAt Brett Kavanaugh nothing and I think it's because of his kids why because they are being so badly injured and I'm just thinking twenty thirty forty years from now people will throw this at them and judge Kavanaugh knows that and that's why he's angry what do you think Senator Cornyn\nI don't blame him for being angry and uh this uh this ridiculous allegation that the judge will somehow be a partisan or hug\nNot display the appropriate temperament on the bench this man has been slandered he's been accused of multiple crimes and he felt it was important to defend his good name and I I thought I thought he handled it appropriately\nUh there were a couple of times where I think well one time in particular where he asked judge or send her corporate charter question he came back and apologize for that and I think that was the right thing to do\nBut he shouldn't be expected just to take a this the slander these allegations of criminal conduct and are ruining his reputation and good name and damaging as family anybody in that position\nWho feels like they had been falsely accused I think would be angry and um be justified in showing some of that anger\nThat last question senator I I Know that some people might be obliged some good faith because of the FBI report not to vote for um judge Kaplan I I think it will be a huge mistake unless there is direct corroborating evidence but I also believe a Republican doesn't support him his or her\nCareer done as a Republican I've never seen the base this way is that the general sense in the pockets\n[noise] well I think you'll see overwhelming support in the caucus for uh for the judge there are some of our colleagues who for whom this FBI supplemental background investigation was requested they said it would be necessary\nBut I Believe that there is no cooperation which I Believe will be the case that uh that will eliminate the last obstacle to the judge getting confirmed\nAnd then completely off the topic will the u._s. NCAA pass the necessary margin in I don't know if it's fast track majority of the treaty two thirds but the new NAFTA will pass the Senate\nI think that it's going to be an uphill fight because uh when we pass trade promotion authority there were Thirteen Democrats forty seven Republicans to pass that\nAnd of course we've seen just visceral up opposition to everything that the president proposes and so it's going to be a tough sell but I certainly hope we uh we can do it and ah it'll require fifty one votes is you know\nI didn't know that so it's only a fifty one vote number\nThat's correct we probably not going to get to it I wouldn't think you until after the first of the year given the timing of of this so uh but I it's it's something worth doing and I think we needed

to Senator Mitch McConnell president founding partner of calvary yellow see judge you know Mitch McConnell well do you he says we're going to have a vote this week do you believe that he will\nYeah I Do I Do Brian I'm you know they work through this process which has just been absolutely horrible and I think we should probably spend admit it talking about a regrettable is how we got here in the first place but\nUh yeah McConnell has been working when you have fifty one member yeah fifty one different personalities people just react to different things and\nYou know last week we got to the point where it's three Republican senators have expressed reservations about moving forward without a another FBI investigation that the seven now that Kevin Olival undergone\nA and so that's happening and I I I think if he wasn't McConnell he expects that that'll come back today or tomorrow and apple time for senators to review it and cast a vote on friday\nNow a one on one you know the it's the same a cast of moderate Republicans usually or people anti Trump hers they'd get Mitch what kind of a hard time can you tell me how he's going to go about dealing with Collins Murkowski and it's like\nForty listens to the right I mean it's like I said it's a different stimulus rage senator and there are a large number vast majority of Republican senators at this point the thing that we are\nEngaged and a left wing charade here that is I Do too happy yeah and and I I agree with that but but I think you've got senators Collins Murkowski like a colon says got an amazing amount of due diligence on a cab and all met with them for over an hour and you'd every one of his\nUh uh decisions as a judge has gone through everything and she wants to be absolutely sure that she's got a handle on everything\nThere now Murkowski in particular wanted this FBI investigation and so now that she's got that\nI suggest you know she she made it very clear in meetings after Senator Flake brokered is quote unquote deal that um\nSenator Flake brokered is quote unquote deal that um these are the parameters that she would be comfortable with than she would move forward once the FBI are investing and she came back and assuming it didn't reveal anything we didn't already know you know I assume that she is she's also going to be comfortable with the end of the\nDay or who do you also have Brian that it's not just those three Republicans you've got senators like Joe Manchin of West Virginia lose\nIndicated that he's open for business and you got senator Heidi Heitkamp who has an announce one way or another I doubt very highly that she would vote for any Republican Supreme Court nominee at this stage but but but perhaps and at least they haven't ruled it out as every other democratic senator has\nRight a good couple of things you know when we're healthcare went down I Know he was appointed but this is personal for him what does the Supreme Court mean to him\nJohn means a lot it means a lot you know going back very early stages in his career he had to have you focused on the judiciary and then of course his career before he became majority leader was defined by\nA judicial fight that ultimately went to the Supreme Court McConnell the S. E. C. where he sued the federal government over the McCain Feingold campaign finance laws um and lost five four and you know if ever you want to have a\nLot of sense for how important are the Supreme Court is you could lose five for the Supreme Court and so\nYou know he's dedicated the last Fifteen Years to making sure that they have the most conservative judiciary possible and of course that has gone through many iterations taking us through Merrick Garland and everything else where we are today\nI Want you hear the president said that I don't think it's helpful to Mitch McConnell but you might know different cut to\nThirty six years ago\nI had one right I Want to\nDo you think it was I was wondering\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't know\nSo it was really the first time he's been remarkably disciplined over the last two weeks but not last night doesn't matter\nIf it's not my favorite stuff for sure but but I also understand that frustration you know you look at a New York times every day and you got a new report we know that Brett Kavanaugh throws ... we know that he writes letters to his roommates caught on the ... of noxious drunks we tried to assassinate his character and every English at every paper and English speaking language\nAnd yet nobody is not a simple property check on on Dr Ford or any of the people who've come forward and\nAccused Brett Kavanaugh's everything from from gang rape to being at a tawdry parties so I understand the frustration and I think highlighting some of those inconsistencies as an avid ... it's also part of the reasons why this process should never gotten here in the first place you the kind of allegations that give litigate\nBehind closed doors and the Judiciary Committee often does to make sure that you protect noxious the accused for the accuser hey you know\nAnd you know what I'm Wondering Josh or the one thing about Democrats in last year was a safe so for example you eat so did invite for the Senate deal did the Iranian deal with a bad deal with the president and you don't have to worry about it I'm going to implement it anyway I mean President Obama was the most part the Democrat stuck together\nAnd I wouldn't say they just know it was a matter of moderate liberals are mostly on the left they'll stick together\nRepublicans never have that Mitch McConnell's always doing was mccaskey in college a major issues\nThere's always a problem with an anti Trump or whether it's been fast we're in this case or a Jeff Flake and I remember during the Bush years with Senator Lugar sometimes and others who would take on President Bush of the things why is it hard for the Republicans tonight\nFor Democrats don't have moderate you know it's kind of like a fun little retrospect to hearken back to the days of President Kennedy and others to add\nYou know more of a moderate ideology but now you look at the Democratic party and Elizabeth Warren find yourself in the mainstream you know this is this is a party that derive its energy from abolish ice in the peach President Trump and\nSome of the most radical ideas that you can come up with in in American government and so you know what the Republican Party I Love if everybody agreed on everything absolutely but I'm also Greg glad that they got a big enough tent where we can appeal to all faith based on where they live\nYou know these people can be won over that's where it used to be a Leslie Josh other part of the United states might do more of the most significant things they got just buried sat really the president's fault and that is redoing NAFTA us MCA whatever it's called a a but it's done and I just had I talked to a dairy farmer on television in an hour ago\nOr ... praise this deal this is unbelievable the urgency worker former delivery is if the president promised and delivered\nTotally incredible and it's the first time any president and even try right I mean we've heard\nFrom the Democratic party and particularly the last Thirty years every campaign cycle is about how bad NAFTA is our shipping jobs overseas until President Trump and brands that agenda and that every Democrat talks about great NAFTA is\nAnd and the bottom line is the first president is actually a rolled up his sleeves and went to work I Try to make a make it better for American workers across the country right like he set includes farmers includes manufacturing includes\nAll the the the tenets of the American economy that have been really neglected for a whole lot of years\nThey just have to find a way I mean these you should be easy but they have a hard time packaging their success\nOr they seemed to be on the ... they're good to good fighting back against the taxes they think are just Republicans can affect haven't been affected in packaging the success they've had let's see if that changes I Know you help kids Mitch McConnell reelected in twenty fourteen and he wants to hold on to the Senate and his power Josh Holmes thanks so much\nThank you so much for she had to\nGo get him a one eight six six for all eight seven six six on I'm going to talk to you in just a moment you're on your on the line here next and give it away to build better check books written by Ian O'Connor\nThat guy and they will tell you my likely I Am fascinated we're not making the headline of this perjury situation at the latter at that ... I think it's like she does\nIt get many a thought ... these women that do are holding out they're about to go look at the ... the big deal and I just cannot take with Kavanaugh I'm I don't understand why they\nTook ... leading line\nYou're talking about the accuser number three sweat Nick\nNo I'm Talking about the ex boyfriend of Mrs Ford he said I watched her administer polygraph at the perjury herself\nShe yet that you're right she did she did to help a friend because she says she's a therapist that psychologists his PHD she did help her friend and coach your friend through a polygraph test and she answers and no I've never done that she did\nAnd you know she knows how to pass one obviously and that was would I guess the prosecuting attorney maybe new that ahead of time I'm not sure but I'm sure they did ask the question so he he's the president didn't go after sweat next attorney he obviously does not like having a ... and I don't blame him I don't either cut three\nWe add another woman just retarded [noise]\nName is Abby [noise]\nWell it turned out [noise]\nEven NBC who is as bad as they get\nEven with that interview did you see that as\nSoon as she when she did is he gives his story how she saw him a a teenage Brett Kavanaugh\nOn standby a punch bowl and he knew found out later that the punch bowls were spike so she didn't see him spike the punch bowl with clay lose or any type of liquor but he was standing by their he didn't do anything in terms of solving or that he knows of but he was in a group he wasn't in a line\nFor groups actually was in a group well huddled around a room that had group sex in it she sadly is assaulted if it was indeed true but people around her including a parents don't really believe it\nNow on the earlier topic on the polygraph\nFormer FBI assistant director for intelligence Kevin Brock talked to Shannon last night about these claims of forward training a friend for the polygraph test could twenty three and a standard\nPolygraph to have one or two operative questions that are asked um so what\nIf somebody wants to look at the recordings I Want to see how the question was framed they want to hear what the actual answers war um but I Will say my experience and I've dealt with political first both from the FBI and those who are hired privately [noise] um [noise]\nWhen you hire a Pulitzer for you get when you pay for that's been my experience is as simple as that uh nobody should be surprised that an outcome of a polygraph uh\nFrom somebody that you hire largely comports with the outcome you're looking for\nWho they know what to ask the questions and she knows how to ask questions now we know she was helping a friend passed one [noise]\nSo do you see the problem ... if she's actually sold is terrible but if she was cluster phobic that's not true it doesn't seem that you couldn't have lived in a five hundred foot square apartment five hundred feet with one entrance that according to a boyfriend or six years\nShe's not afraid to fly she lied about that\nNot afraid to fly lately yeah and we don't do it shows no where to him when he left out so there's a huge problem with the story you know how I Know Michelle there now leukemia bread coughing all its temperament and in the hearing that's how I Know\nThat's our polygraph what yet they're now true or false I care and he lied under oath and that story she done\nRight of the actual show Richard in Montreal Richard you disagree with me you think it was a good move for the president to start ripping her last night on stage and Mississippi\nThere so I thought it was an excellent idea he pointed out all our lives these aren't inconsistencies is our ... and all these journalists will continue to say how credible she is\nAnd they're not even on the other networks are not even reporting about 'em or ex boyfriends letter and as Chris Wallace going to report that on Fox on the front yard 'cause he likes to cover up everything to now he doesn't like cover up following covers up plenty of things I I don't think he's covered up I really don't oh he did a report that the the [noise]\nAnyway [noise] coverage is not going to report this he covers everything up the attacks from day and like and I'm tired of it that's why he's always up with ... with the ship Smith hates President Trump how come I never see Chris Wallace on Sean Hannity's show\nWell um he doesn't do the nighttime shows he does Tucker and he shot and um he tried to stay on the opinion shows she does because he does not want to be listed as a Republican or Democrat hoax\nIt doesn't do any good are these people who could Chuck Todd and they go he left\nYou know they they look at which I actually think the new host Margaret Brennan updates nations pretty fair I Do a this was the choice of Annapolis when people see George to have an apple two C. Bill Clinton I don't care how good is questions are bad questions or to quit swallows his goal is to say tough questioner\nThat's it he's ... he's not going to be afraid to go after year\nSo I Know what frustrates people but I Do say I I don't know anybody who doesn't think Chris is fair\nBut I Know that some people think they maybe you should be easier on the president I I kinda like his tone it helps me get ready for this show\nThey listened W.
