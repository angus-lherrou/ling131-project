wealth of the country to the people who are working for it and it's gonna be clearly an underlying fire that's ready to be put in this lame at any moment\nAnd I believe a new era of trust posting is we're on the cusp of a new Arab trust trusting that could only be avoided if\nThe tech titans distribute there not their money to their money but distribute their jobs in places where we are in need and that's why I think Google going in Arbor is such a great idea why hope\nAmazon goes to Columbus or Virginia or someplace that needs a lot of jobs let me turn to the end of leadership in turbulent times because he was there we find\nMaybe the best friends which is the current era and President Trump you write about Lincoln to your FDR and LBJ the fame they craved the recognition they sought bears little resemblance to today's cult of celebrity for these leaders the final measure of their achievements would be realized by this is the key line\nWhenever and mittens tuned in during plays in communal memory before we talk about President Trump and that\nCommunal memory before we talk about President Trump and that goal what is an enduring place in communal memory I think I Know where do you explain\nWhat I think what it means is that at a certain point when a leader goes into politics they go in perhaps for themselves at the start\nBut at a certain point it gets transferred into an ambition for the greater good to accomplish something that will stand the test of time and that normally mean something that creates more economic opportunity and a greater degree of social justice we know when we look back at our leaders what happened during their era did people be able to share more in the country's\nGoods did people feel better at the end that something had happened in their lives that they had more opportunity it's not hard to figure it out or what they are a war that was prosecuted that has to be one and that was one like depression that has to be lifted\nOff and the leaders will go into communal memory by those who have great challenges to face that is what Abigail Adams said great is that each create great virtues but it's not always so that they are up to those challenges though sometimes they can go into memory at a very negative way I mean James Buchanan with the president when the country was falling apart in the Eighteen fifty and was\nOnly able to exacerbate the problem is rather than hills up and he goes down as one of the worst part of history\nI'm not sure that um that Herbert Hoover was capable of his given his temperament of dealing with a depression is extraordinarily good man but how to fix ideology but he faced the same challenge that FDR was FDR goes down and can you know memory\nAs does Teddy Roosevelt and asked us to ever have Lincoln and even though that Lyndon Johnson having faced ... as a southerner\nAnd made his conviction that the civil rights bill would be his first priority the risky to\nThat memory of civil rights will go down even though the war in Vietnam will always be a scar on his like I say it was not celebrities not doing what you want at that moment it's not just campaigning it's really going forward and mobilize in the country toward tasks that will make the country and the people in a better if\nIt's a big thing and and that's if that's your desire it somehow lift you up of the daily struggle\nArguably the greatest leader Americans had in terms of the longest period of time would be like a leader of a ... D then virtually or shape a NATO leader Columbia University of course eight years in the White House during a period of time when the Soviets reached parity with us from a hundred and bomb and we had to begin\nA recognition of the new world order with a nuclear age I could pull it off but I I don't really think has a place in our communal memory yet Doris Kearns Goodwin do you\nI think it's missing place I think there will be more biographies devise an hour I think the way he handles the presidency and the dignity that he brought to it and clearly the leadership he brought during World War two and two the beginnings of the Cold War I think these leaders sometimes it takes a generation\nOr it takes a biography written about the person to put their whole life is you just did in in those few moments in perspective not just but he did as a presidency but what his whole life meant to be\nAnd yeah I think he'll come up in the presidential historian polls they come up and down after a period of time and sometimes it's looking back on an era from the context of our own era of the relatively peaceful this of the Nineteen fifties I think what's so much better for us now and we don't take it for granted\nThe way we might have what now that we've had a period of such perpetual war on our side similarly the looking back on Lyndon Johnson ability to deal with Congress get bipartisan support for major legislation not\nGreat civil rights laws but Medicare PBS NPR headstart immigration reform and most importantly bringing both Republicans and Democrats together in our broken political system that looks so much better what we took for granted threats currents that generation but I say I said how as a person is definitely ready for great leadership stuffy\n... the last question about leadership and turbulent times has to do with Donald Trump whose numbers are improving views change the Supreme Court he's won the third year battle for the Supreme Court\nMilitary putting rebuild the economy was booming along but of course we're divided country and I'm just watching the news this morning was blaming Trump for the pipe bomb that Sarah what do you see emerging which way as his reputation going to go based upon extrapolating the first two years in the next two and possibly six\nI think the main question will be is there a point in which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he hoped to do and that trial he has to reach out to expand the base not just up the base and try and become the leader of all the people\nThat is a huge transition that still has not taken place\nAnd the question will be yes people are feeling better about their jobs they may be feeling better and that's important they may be feeling better even about the confidence in the economy do they feel better as citizens right now\nThey feel that the country is in a more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way they wake up every morning and they see something on television that they wished they weren't seeing that sense of feeling good about being a citizen of the country\nUm is another level I think of judging are you a better or worse off having been here for two years and simply the material goods that are at the bottom which absolutely important as well\nSo we'll see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and if it leads into even more violence as we might be seeing potentially in these last couple of days and I think we have to use that as a standard for its leader leading us in a direction\nThat is helping us become a better country or is or the discourse that he's not only responsible for a visit escalating under his watch and we need about\nDoris Kearns Goodwin direct thank you for coming and joining me leadership in turbulent times with a new book leadership in turbulent times available every book store in
