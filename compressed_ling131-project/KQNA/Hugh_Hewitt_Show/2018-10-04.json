years on the Republican side of the aisle and what Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has to do is keep the triumvirate of Jeff Flake of Arizona Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to gather\nSome potential witnesses complain they reached out to the FBI but we're never contacted\nOne police officer is dead was six wounded in South Carolina authorities said the suspects fired at Lawrence county sheriff's deputies attempting to serve a warrant while holding children hostage in a home in an upscale neighborhood Florence police responded to the initial gunfire but we're

because\nI have represented the victim of sexual assault\nUp his case probably and thirty five years because of the indifference of the authorities are them stonewalling of the boys that were involved or the lack of support you receive from everybody\nLike ed but this was before me too and so I Would I Am a big fan of me too me too can be done with due process\nMe to does not mean accuse you are convicted there isn't any evidence against judge Kavanaugh there is only evidence of twelve years on the DC circuit court of appeals three hundred and fifty opinions seven now FBI background investigation\nThe FBI contacted ten potential witnesses they interviewed nine of them\nNine of them not clear why the tenth wasn't interviewed and there is according to the White House has nothing to corroborate Dr\nWards a doctor forwards allegations nothing at all so I remind you what is at stake I went over this earlier and I just want to remind you before for court is a disaster ... it will be for for court for years and beyond\nIf Kavanaugh is not come from I Believe that Republicans will lose the majorities in both the house in the Senate and it won't even be close Republicans will disrupt their hand and say I'm done\nThey did this to us on Obamacare a bill second time around they collapse and not going to be part of this party a second late that which gets rewarded gets repeated\nMcCarthyism works against Brett Kavanaugh it will be used against everyone every single nominate but especially judges will face a last minute allegation from somebody in their past that they don't even remember very well you just go and ask if you've ever been falsely accused of anything\nNothing serious just someone wrongly said you know you didn't returning the report on time\nOr you you didn't fill up the car with gas or you didn't change that tired whatever it is from small to a huge false accusations hurt that can destroy when they're big issues and if you get this guy killed off because of a false accusation\nIt will happen again and again and again later in the process later in the process later in the process and then when you use one set of accusations to launch a witch hunt can do is pass into the beach house flooded as as as Howard Kurtz and it's just absurd\nThrowing ice in a bar in Nineteen eighty five I think about that Nineteen eighty five Nineteen

actually entirely within ... said it's constitutional authority than than I hearing it might be irrelevant for partisan Democrats but since when is the burden of proof irrelevant to journalists\nI could go on for pages about this right Jonah but here's the point on nearly every question issue the tenor of the press shockingly mirrors the tenor of the Democrats who insist that it fails Kevin out to disprove these allegations that is an understandable I'll be morally grotesque position for part of some Democrats\nWho made it clear they will do whatever it takes again as Chuck Schumer admitted

Lindsey Graham didn't want to liberal judge like Kagan a scribe has put and set them off but he voted for him because they weren't competent Web traffic is competent but he doesn't agree with you and you can't get your vote why [noise]\nI'm In my view the jurisprudence of a judge Kavanaugh is well outside the mainstream I think his views on presidential power and an individual liberty\nAre beyond the mainstream of American Jurisprudence I don't think that's the case with Kagan instead of my or my friend Senator Graham has made that point to me personally and forcefully\nThat in his view the confirmation process has gotten away from looking at credential and credibility to any allergy\nSo Scalia wouldn't have gotten his vote that was Chris Coons on Fox and friends on the show I'm On a Fifteen minutes ago so he wouldn't he got his old because of how we would have voted and and some of his decisions in the past\n... not many people who are legal experts like Jonathan Turley who I just hung up with and you just heard on the show I think that he's out of the mainstream of conservative thought in fact one of the critiques against President Trump's choice was to conventional\nI mean the fact is that George Bush and uh and Karl Rove and a lot of the conventional Republican conservatives watch him on the bench they thought wow that's not Trump being\nAnd now you have Chris Coons who I tend to think his level headed on the Democratic side say that Eric who's a WD be owner window Eric\n... a Brian great show I think I'm On a main points I'd say about Kavanaugh she was good enough to carry the nuclear football having the highest security clearance on planet earth that's good enough for me I'm ... uh\nBut uh my daughter my daughter's got her bachelor's degree in psych and she'd like to get her master's degree but she says that they're stored woman's liar when she says under oath says she knows nothing about the polygraph\nIf you're a die if you have a PHD in psychology and you know exactly how polygraph works and you know that if you cry during one they create false negatives they only released to our questions on the polygraph test and I'd like to hear your take on that\nA couple of things number one what you taking it for she's taking it in the summer before her name was out and she thought she was everything was going to be confidential that's kind of odd she retained a lawyer all that kind of odd so now she wants to an antibody she's not mad and whoever leaked out the name that's kind of odd I mean that destroyed that changed your life forever\nThe fact is I talked to someone today who's best friends uh was really good friends with the person who dated her for six years and he told me this guy's got impeccable credential and said she never talked about sexual assault well maybe that's a reason\nNumber two he says there's never ... never was caused her phobic never afraid to fly\nAnd never talked about a an ad and did help her friend Paso I take tests that was where this story came from\nAnd this guy it doesn't want his name out there but was tracked down and did answer the questions when he was tracked down\nSo that interview is out there too so she's got problems with her story people think the judge Kavanaugh was not telling the truth about his blackout that's why his blackouts that may or may not have happened in high school or college could stop a judge from going to the Supreme Court\nHow silly is this [noise]\nWhen we come back we'll take more of your calls and uh and when we come back also look into this Russia investigation took a fascinating turned yesterday on the Trump side\nBut also you should have brought up about how Nancy Pelosi's just out of a mind to him and she'll never change and also no one ever brought this up I just wanted to explain something to you you're married or what do you call is married to say I'm married if any if your wife came out with those allegations okay\nRick you'll be sitting next to her twenty seven and that thing and go there with the ...\nI mean a call ... I'm not sure but I Would tell you this thing she won evidently she wanted her husband interviewed for this pro right Alison thousands also a lawyer Alison ... is is that true that he had had you on that her husband in the media\nAnd right up none of the people that I Know Coons reference that you know the essay I didn't interview everyone that for for quite in one of them being or has\nThe right and the thing is that that's a good point Joe but there's also a preference the other thing I keep it in the back of my mind\nWhen you marry Brett Kavanaugh you know you're living of our public life to a degree if you're dating a I'm a you know other people that you know you're not signing onto this public life I Know maybe the husband does not want to public life and if he's sitting behind her he'll never has is anonymity again\nAnd sometimes people and businesses that you need Republicans and Democrats let's say you owned a restaurant I don't know what the husband does let's say you're a realtor and you don't want everyone to know that your wife came out to try to uh destroyed Brett Kavanaugh\nI think it was more simple simpler than that but I read was that he stayed home with the kids to that they'd have a sense of normalcy\nYou know came by ... by a Julie thank you uh Tim was on W. H. I. O. in Dayton hate him\nBrian love your show just want to bring something up about a professor Ford why did she needed go fund the I'm a page her lawyer said that they were paying for everything but probably pay for all of our flight and everything there to take care of everything for her [noise]\nUm I'm just curious [noise] set that up because once she testified she said that she did not know how to get into it you didn't know anything about it and now she's a millionaire\nOr a couple of things the same way Michael Cohen want to go find me page or to pay for Lanny Davis Lanny Davis has Michael Cohen's lawyer and he is expensive so Michael Cohen has no money to fund me page\nSo glad he wants to get paid a so I go for me paid paid for the lawyers there'll be grad us unless somebody comes up there and pays the bills\nSo that that's a good point I don't know if she did it to be rich ... when you have a PHD and your psychiatrist usually can make a pretty good living\nBut uh there's a lot of mystery around her but you know ... including a lot of the story now all of a sudden she wants her life thoroughly investigated she wants to mount multiple people and she only turn over the therapist notes if she's asked to testify for the FBI\nSo\nUh Debbie Ramirez couldn't remember anything then she did remember something you know a corroborated the story now she's got twenty witnesses or is she getting great law lawyers and they are finding other people that the ends justifies the means if I could stop it conservative from getting on the bench it's okay if I come out and corroborated story I really don't remember\nBrian uh by the way I Want you to hear that and thanks for the call Tim I Want you to you that Nancy Pelosi by this is what the caller from W RCN was referring to\nGod this is Nancy Pelosi listen to she compares Brett Kavanaugh to cut you off\nThe signs of your kids in the article on the phone from hearing a lot of very\nLittle [laughter]\nFrom them [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] yeah that wasn't it um the one she compares father wouldn't want to hear is when she compares Brett Kavanaugh who the president likes with Kim Jong on\nYou comparing this guy to a brutal dictator that repressive jail and sometimes murders his own people\nWith Brett Kavanaugh\nI mean that's a woman that might be the next speaker Brian listening W. P. TEFA Bryant\nGet more and more than I Am wondering if anyone has a salad audio recording of Dr Ford other than the ones that are available where she testified to the Senate committee [noise]\nOh you mean comparing her voice if she went out of a way to sound us yes yup that's a tough thing to do there might be curiosity but that that wouldn't benefit anybody to bring it out and listen to how authoritative sheet sounds compared to how makes you sounded especially when her first words\nBrian we're I'm terrified so they'll just say that's why my voice was so high I was terrified of it was about to happen to me [noise]\nSo uh thanks so much for the call over in Raleigh North Carolina a love the fact that we have that station\nThere's a couple of things is going to happen it's going to happen to eleven o'clock and we'll take a break after this and eleven o'clock today it looks like the Democrats are going to have a professor at which time they're going to say how did satisfy they are with the scope of the interview they got nine they wanted more\nNext they're going to say that Senator Grassley was mistaken when he said in Kavanaugh's background there was no trace of impropriety\nSexual drinking issues and not a whiff was the term that\nSenator Grassley had not with that prompted eight Senate Democrats from signing a letter saying that's not true that there is something on his background check\nThat shows a ... inappropriate and this and I asked senator Coontz about this I said is that or did you time as you said no I said why not what are we talking about he goes there is something confidential we can never ever say it\nPublicly but it does show the Grassley essentially overstated when they said there was nothing on his record\nThere you go again last minute statements\nComing out to try to trip up an investigation into their trip up a candidate say before it gets to the vote\nIs Robert ...
