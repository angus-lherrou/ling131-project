crowd number one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine we find out if a if it's crazy hurricanes are because of all that\nEven though the way it seems like all of California's burning all the time\nRight there are localized increases in in California we can that that's actually an interesting story Cal Fire here I'm getting off on a different subject but with Cal Fire ministers almost twenty five million acres\nOf the lower lying non mountainous terrain and and there are forest fires are actually declining over the last several decades in California the high mountainous areas controlled by the U.S Forest Service\nWe have seen an increase there but it's probably due to different a forest management practices were how they have not\nPreviously they had controlled burns that clear it out a lot of the brush in fact they had a Cal Fire said there were four to five times as many trees in that area controlled by the U.S Forest Service than what a healthy forest\nWouldn't wouldn't normally have just imagine you've got all these trees competing for the little bit of moisture there\nWell I mean when you had the other scientists is I Believe in climate change because I Believe in science would not tell them\nWhy of course that's a misnomer of course climate is changing and of course there's there's I don't I Know of no one who disputes that uh it's pretty clear we've been warming the warming started three hundred plus years ago it started in the year sixteen Ninety five\nIn the depths of the little ice age\nAnd we've been warming ever sense there's really not not much in the last hundred and fifty years that looks\nDifferent from the first hundred and fifty years of the three hundred year warming so sure that that's what I hear as old as the climate change deniers and none of my I'm a climate skeptic at in terms of\nI'm skeptical of a human link that's leading to catastrophic climate change\nAh I see the same natural forces in in place driving temperatures up and down up and down ever since ... since the dawn of time and those are what Michael Mann and Al Gore want your listeners to believe is that those those seem natural forces could have been driving temperatures up and down\nSuddenly seized at the beginning of the twentieth century really really that's not how science works and your listeners know that so those same ... same natural forces that have\nCaused a temperatures to increase in I'll I'll remind your listeners that historically going back forty five hundred years or so\nUh the the rise and fall of temperatures and clearly relate to the rise and fall of civilizations when it's warming period like we're in right now you can grow crops you can be played harvests and it's the cold periods that really\nAre bad each cold period is corresponds to famine a death nasty population and it's just the opposite of what we're being told\nThey used to be before climate science became politicized these warming periods recalled and climatic optimal and why were they called that because\nFor the earth and humanity worm has historically been\nReally really good and the cold periods like we are coming out of out of the little ice age that been\nReally really bad and we should be we should all be thankful that you know we're in a warming warming period we can grow more food CEO twos fertilizing the plant's growing more crops um humanity\nAnd if the climate I went to the audience you you were in September twenty eighth year in St Louis Missouri and you would not treated well let's with\nClimate models predict warming and climate models used by the inter governmental panel on climate change over predict warming by two and a half times too much three times [noise]\nTimes the amount\nThat we get\nTo that perpetuate the lie and create the apathy\nSo you you as you get interrupted by people they don't agree with you\nYeah it's it's really [noise]\nBrian as a scientist it's it it is hard and maybe see what's going on with that was really it didn't mean nation of the scientific process it used to be that\nThat the scientific process welcomed people with counter counter views and and they would test those views but today we have to be shouted down the true science deniers or those on the left that are\nThe ... of alarm is on\nThere they cannot allow\nAny science or any information any fact that might dispute their their their notion of man made catastrophic warming because if you get that in there and you start they they accept one thing it's kind of like the camel's nose under the tent than\nAh than almost admitting that they they can't admit that there is a debate\nAnd there is much them to admit that would mean that the sciences and settled\nWe added a lot of places great since you do have a point of view and that people like Al Gore overstaying is\nShort I just spoke ... well I spoke at a recent scientific conferences uh in Houston where I was a greatly or received there I I just got out of the conference in Pittsburgh my home base here this week\nUh there was ...
