aren't I Want to go back to the Brett Kavanaugh proceedings with you for a moment um\nAfter the testimony a doctor for\nUm some time passed and Brett Kavanaugh appeared and he was angry and as a result of that anger many people questioned here judicial temperament and I thought to myself if you had not been angry then I Would question judicial temperament because you've been accused of cereal gang rape or I mean granted slander\nPossible actually a term that but what was that what what is what is wrong with our commentary at in this regard\n[noise] yeah well we're supposed to bow you know to these things and or you're not supposed to supposed to what you know\nI I don't I I think it was a very good judgment not to attack professor Ford uh I think she didn't seek all of this I thought Susan Collins stateless eloquent about all of that I thought it was dignified I thought she had to sign moment there\nAnd and the point is this woman had you know she wrote a letter and she's troubled and she thinks she remembers something and she can't remember the sales\nAnd she didn't she didn't try to trust this thing forward other people got hold of it and make it and I think the blame of all because as I say about that thing how you gonna how are you gonna run the country\nIf somebody\nA stage allegations and you know I said there's no proof available well it's a little worse than that right because if you read that thing by the by the council for this to me that interviewed her\nThe details of her story are inconsistent and you know so there are some things that are verifiable they're not as she said and she said more than one thing about things and some that are actually lose it well I don't blame her for that these are old memories about something painful\nAnd uh but but the truth is to make that a cause to disrupt this thing is failure of the rule of law\nNow in terms of the presumption of innocence and due process what the most astonishing me about this is it so many people through and so quickly\nWith the idea that an accusation without contemporaneous corroborating evidence can be vetted in public without damage not just to the accused but to the process I mean it is it is nowhere in our tradition in the common law\nOr to allow someone to convict via accusation I mean that goes back before the country was founded\nIn the context of it right this is not a trial he's not nobody's brought charges against him this is a political event and it's certainly true that is right it's fine\nTo raise charges against him and it's even ... rage wild ones but\nThe one hopes that will be effective but look what happened here he goes through\nA a a set of exhaustive hearings is investigated he interviews privately with every senator who was willing to talk to him and then the other thing is he has a long career this guy has a paper trail\nAnd he's not some young guy just out of the box right he's he's been so there's a huge amount of material\nAnd it's obvious that they're getting ready to vote for him and then this stuff is brought up and that is not fair or a good political maneuver and if you transfer that to what it would take to convict the guy of something which is rightly a different standard than just making the argument about politics\nThen this is crazy 'cause it would never go anywhere\nAnd when we come back we're going to play for your

stocks once they get hammered apple alphabet Netflix\nActually was right and my friend John Dickerson was not\nBut there is a broad and the land a great ignorance about the basic fact the Senate is a majority ... institution that agrees to operate by super majority rules in some instances rules which they can change is Harry Reid demonstrated on their whim\nAnd which Mitch McConnell changed after Harry Reid chained to them with regard to the Supreme Court justices and the fact of the matter is I don't I think we will we will if a God Forbid adjusted drop dead\nThree weeks before the election of a\nTwenty twenty I think the Senate would come from a replacement [laughter]\n[laughter] I wouldn't be surprised at so first of all ... remember what\nMcConnell did at the moment when he delayed Merrick Garland it looked like Hillary Clinton was going to win the election right and so he wasn't he was actually making the authority of the people more telling or stronger in the process\nThis is one of the things you get to choose when you vote for president\nSo the idea that he was trying to force people he actually involved in more in the process and I'll say it's it's actually opposite because you know in the great ... said earlier\nThe first time ... opposition party throughout the governing party by a popular vote without violence was in a two hundred in America and the federalist party which had built the country for goodness sake\nGot hammered by Jefferson's party and Madison's party here at all so built\nAnd so what they do they have all these midnight point after the election after they know they've got hammered and they just got days to go to a whole bunch of people in there and they don't get 'em all down and that's what gave rise to the great court case ... versus Madison\nBut they were you know that was in the eleventh hour saying you against a popular vote this is the opposite of that\nYou betcha but they were ... it was both are legitimate and and what I Want to point the rules are laid out this is not secret\nWe operate under a constitutional structure that was meant to be read by was reading debated by farmers some of whom are not literate\nBut who would listen closely and we over complicate this this is the Senate has the right to not hold a hearing the Senate has a right to confirm in one day the Senate whatever the majority of the Senate wants to do the Senate can do\nAn election and there's a link soon soon right and so if they do anything that people don't like the people can punish them\nRight now and that's what keeps the sun is you're right about that right and and if you are if a\nLiquid liquid McConnell is done and he's proud of himself right because the election who would have predicted it All right at the presidential election when they win\nAnd that Harry Reid changed that rule I wished by the way that they would restore the filibuster generally to its nineteenth century and most of the twentieth century meaning and then they can pass a lot more laws and when the other guys get in the past a lot more laws and then the people get a chance to choose\nIt looks to me like carnival maneuvering us toward a better position in regard to that\nHe's been doing he was an absolutely amazing leader and I know that some in our number on the right\nTo not like him for reasons I cannot figure out but he

this at that level and Mitch McConnell with Donald Trump and Don McGahn\nWho is the unsung hero here has worked a revolution\nThat's it well they were serious about it from the first minute and and remember this to\nA Donald Trump as a candidate announced a list of the kinds of people he would kick in other words he has submitted his direction just like I said McConnell did a minute ago they

look at all of it what was gained what was lost in what was one\nSo I've never seen somebody comes to the White House and get such a such a a a wide spectrum of response is number one county was not like everybody not many people have its talent not many people have is success and not many people are like Kim how about that\nAs an African American he does not agree with everything Trump does he does not agree that Trump wants to put stop and frisk back he does not like that\nHe a great degree when it comes to guns they don't agree when it comes to some aspect of racism he says America should be grey goes America great not a a make a great again because he says for black people and as it has not been great\nSo this is different from President Trump but it doesn't matter he's pulling for President Trump and they also want to heal race relations\nAnd get everything back on track for everybody you would think that's a good objective instead they act like Kanye West to the Henry Kissinger of inner city urban projects for the president know he's a supporter he got invited to the White House what is the problem with that Jim Brown\nWhether you've had an accident tangle with

much money in the financial markets pretty want and what are your the talk of the quad cities cake you in a\nThere's roughly a dozen a U.S citizens being held in Turkey we don't have any hard evidence here but the timing does look awfully awfully interesting and maybe not so coincidentally at at the same time as we have this\nIncident with a ... and the ah Saudi conflict Nintendo at the same time the Turks appear to be wanting to warm their relationship with the United states\nWhich has been suffering over the past couple of years\nAnd all the way that is a Daniel hopping former CIA guys boxers contributor and nowhere chicks\nDaniel hopping former CIA guy Fox News contributor who knew worked extensively in that area of the middle east through Iraq\nEspecially in of course Russia and he's saying listen things just to to ah to perfect here there's video of a set would they tell you this how to hit squad coming in this video of the journalists walking at the Washington Post he's there to get a marriage divorce so we can get remarried and then it turns out he doesn't come out\nBut if people leave with bags they say that they have audio of him being questioned tortured and killed and then brought out we know that he was being tried to be lured back in the Saudi Arabia because you're not happy with a lot of his columns\nJoining us how to discuss the possibility that there's been the true and if it's found true so you really are the effects in our relationship with the with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ambassador Robert Jordan's ambassador what she'd Saudi Arabia do now\n[noise] they need to complain a they have every opportunity to explain what happened uh it\nStrange beliefs to suggest that they are closed circuit TV there's only on a live feed and there's not recorded I Will bet my bottom dollars that recordings are always made and should be available unless they conveniently disappeared\nAh I think there is plenty of the Saudis can do to a that provide more transparency provide more cooperation and I think the U.S needs to demand that\nAbsolutely but what I mean if they knew what to shake with a relationship and we are actually evaluate we are supporting them too as they try to get the who the rebels out of Yemen we support them as they try to counterbalance what we've seen these emergency overran to the region why would they risk everything here's the president with us yesterday cut twenty\nKill it can be killing me there unless they everything else there is in jeopardy now I\nFind out what happened when I go out and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out what happened\nAnd he you know according to the report to the audio and we had Bob Corker on yesterday and says that we think he was murdered ambassadors who with his ... he was murdered would be the mindset that will allow the crown prince to think that would be acceptable to us\nI think it is probably a combination of extreme paranoia on his part about even the slightest dissent even moderate descent\nAh coupled with the belief that he has bullet proof or in the eyes of the Trump Administration now his relationship with Jared Kushner a Saudi's position or in the middle east as an important ally that we do depend on a I think has led to a sense of hubris and uh\nUh being impervious to outside influence\n[noise] uh yeah and what do you think so for example a Dan how often as we bumped into those in Turkey in the U.S had been at loggerheads really for the last year or so we don't like the direction of that country their economy is crashing\nSo they want to keep their pride at the same time they want to rekindle relations have not economic relations have everything else so do you think that they would benefit from a crashing of a Saudi American relationship\n[noise] I think they probably would feel they would benefit but I don't think that sense of benefit or could even possibly explain a the notion that they cooked all this up I think that is really a in the never never land a fear right now\nI think we have to believe what they have provided\nA their intelligence services are among the bashed in the region um we have a many contracts with them and despite the fact of relationship is not perfect with them right now we still have a a major airbase at ...\nOr they are still a NATO ally a and I think we have every reason to believe that they are coming forward here ah which trees\nSo what do you what Bob Corker said yesterday cut Nineteen\nJust will change the relationship the war well dissipate uh it'll be far more businesslike and shortly they're going to be put at\nAt arm's length on many issues that we deal with them all and there's an arrogance that has developed with them over the last year and a half an entitlement there's just something about the way they\nDeal with us now that is very very different\n... and ... explain that to me because this crime printed in American Tour trying to tell everybody that women are going to be able to drive going to try to give people additional freedom try to be more tolerant try to allow more demonstrations why go give us that toy dog and pony above pony show but yet you haven't changed\nThe crown prince is anxious for foreign direct investment foreign direct investment since the uh\nIn prison his cousins and uncles that rich Carlton a year ago\nHas dropped off the cliff or it has gone from a seven billion a two one billion dollars so he is anxious for foreign direct investment\nOr he is trying to put a happy face on it but they're in mindset at the same time he is allowing women to drive he goes imprisoning women who had a demonstrated or ex agitated for that right he's making it clear\nThat every privileged they receive in Saudi Arabia comes from him\nAnd not from any kind of sentimental rights and that's a very important distinction so yeah she can he can point to reforms which we welcome them\nAnd even ... complimented him on those reforms\nAnd laugh at the treasury secretary should be going there this week for a conference\nI Do not I think a lot of the treasury secretary should not go I think American business leaders should not go Jamie diamond should go Steven Schwartzman should not do\nWe know Richard Branson is already canceled a thanks so much invested Robert ... Ed Rollins next\nHad some guy looks like Robert F Kennedy but he's a Democrat he talked about the epidemic of of police violence against minorities [noise]\nYou know he talked about health care for all universal Medicare so that that's something that should be resonating with Texans as he takes on Ted Cruz I mean he was with the in a few points and now he Ted Cruz beginning to pull away here's what Karl Rove's head cut thirty seven\nPeople are waking up to the fact that Beto O'Rourke\nRobert Francis O'Rourke is a very liberal guy in favor of impeachment once a government run health care are in favor of free college universal job thinks that the ... said that he can think of nothing more American he said then\nTaking it into Saudi into taking me or at the plane of the national anthem that's not a very to Texas guy the more he gets known as a liberal the lessons of moderates\nAre stronger in his but people have strong opinions about better on strong opinions about that but at the end of the day it's going to be a red victory you ... do you think\nTo cause right there at one of those car no one knows the country better than Carl and certainly Texas a which is where he lives in where he basically built a reputation Ted Cruz is a very strong candidate coming people forget that he actually ran a very very strong campaign against Trump will have signed that probably the best campaign operation\nAre gone and he's got a lot of those people are in there again any themselves are very strong candidate he's very articulate\nAnd I think to a certain extent he's going to eat but when that when that fairly easy\nI think that you know what they say it reminds me of little Bush forty one he when he was a successful businessman made the transition into politics he lost a couple of races including a Senate race but they said while in a democratic state of Texas this Bush guy did very well and he was tapped by the Nixon administration somebody\nThey could join there and and begin to make his name known and they're seeing the same thing in ... or ... even if he loses am I correct\nYeah absolutely they see him as a future a national candidate a you know he's ... he's attractive the raised a lot of money on the Internet or you know Democrats are desperately looking for young candidates are they're very old very outdated party\nA and clearly their message a which is higher taxes Morse manning uh is is totally rejected by the Trump people and I think to a certain extent will be rejected\nAgain but you know the trend uh and you've tried to push against the trend when you were with Reagan the trend is a go back and push back on the party in power and so that's what the uh Donald Trump is fighting against what did the cabinet or a ... confirmation do for this race\nBut I think I think it was such an outrageous attack a man of great credibility in grade a reputation that I think we realize how ruthless and and you know without discipline or the Democrats would be I mean there's there's no no and what they will do\nAnd I think we now know that uh I think what we're going to be some people don't\nRealize this is we have an extraordinary ground game of the congressional committee the national\nCommittee or some of the superPACs ordinary people on the ground the big races the competitive races so I think if you don't\nSee that you know national report that Democrats have been very little of that and I think a certain extent they're going to be a very far it's going to\nBe interesting and Florida you're actually going to earn the wind or not and governor Rick Scott is chief strong which he always seems to be very organized guy in Florida knows how to do hurricanes\nThat would boost to Senate prospects and then somehow Rhonda Santas how did the congressmen he wants to be a governor show himself competent in this situation how would you invite advised the Republican are running against a Gillum\nWho got a lot of support and even though he seems to be a failed mayor in Tallahassee how ... how would you tell them\nI think the key thing here is don't don't over in don't miss represent Gillum directly just talk about what he's done what he stands for because he is a socialist uh uh and I think the reality is that he he is not a credible candidate\nBut if you go trying to go overboard though you have a reaction I think this couple that I Would probably not ever on a dissent is just sort of stumbled out of the out of the box up my he's got a good campaign manager there as soon as the lies\nThat comes campaign or as they used to work with me in the White House many years ago and she is as good as anybody in Florida a you know as I Am very confident the Scots gonna when Scott is a very strong candidate he does very well in national crisis of this is a big crisis down there is this is going to clearly give him some advantages of\nNo citizen very tired or has been underestimating the past when people try to beat him I think this was just on the east coast yeah I'm very optimistic\nDidn't do anything but I just put it this way when you add Rick Scott as governor\nWho did so well for two years and won reelection and as that state growing in in the black uh besides the red tide which he has no control over this would be a Republican to lose so far you have to say that this that this has not done enough to win I mean a ... yard any such a low profile right now I don't get it\nI don't get it either you know he was a guy to basically built a very strong reputation being on Fox or a ... not doing much ... this point in time and\nHe didn't run a different kind of a campaign and uh and I think there's some disappointment a you know there's still time to go uh I mean the key thing there's that will be as a very aggressive at the ballot program 'cause that's a very important to say people are already voting down there and he just hasn't quite caught fire or I Hope he does ah I like him and I\nThink the key thing here is just exposing\nThem for what he is and what he wants to be lost to raise taxes uh he's he's very socialistic can is\nThis approach ah being mayor Tallahassee is about what it takes to be mayor or governor of the states so I I think that race will come back and again Scott Scott I think it was the ... but the Senate race and and if he dies himself to that that race or whatever they\nAre and Fitch got does when he'll be like the one of the Lindsey Graham senators he'll be part of almost every issue he's not going to be quiet and it's just not why you don't\nKnow ... ... he's a very strong candidate a also has the resources to attend and media markets state it's it's not about organizations all about the your message on television and Scott has always run a very effective campaign sent those real\nAnd round is with us now Lou Dobbs allowed me to talk to you I Know you're only going to happen anytime Maria too I'm very jealous but I'll tell you I mean I I ... that you end up but I'm I'm fascinated by what's emerged and that is healthcare number one the through the entire process the controversy that Michael Cohen situation\nThe Russian situation now the cabinet situation when you ask the American people what matters most is healthcare it's a mess right now and out comes Bernie care\nThere's more to health care it's a mess right now and then out comes Bernie care Bernie comes out and writes a column where he says we have to get Medicare for all\nAnd guess what they were thirty nine states that rely on a ... will will go along with Bernie care but you know in ten years is going to cost thirty three billion dollars do you know they tried that in Vermont they had to bail out of it right away because it was on a on obtain a unsustainable do you know the doctors will get less reimbursement\nSo you're talking about a lower quality care spread out through taxpayer dollars no longer have it from the offered from the job\nAnd the Donald Trump or to calm or somebody on the Trump staffer to come and say do you realize what everyone's proposing which leads Donald Trump to do something I think they'd Ed Rollins would support\nTell Democrats you can vote for him listen\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to vote Republican because I have many friends or the Democrats the main base of the\nWhat ended up being Venezuela I think a lot of Democrats are going to be voting Republican\nNaturally trying to say is I'm not telling that to be a Democrat but I'm telling you Democrats have left you\nHave an interest is not a centrist Democratic Party as a party of no party basically\nIt it it was far left 'cause I've seen in modern times uh this is the the Howard Dean Bernie Sanders this is the ... the you know the party to basically lost to the government to do everything for you which means you're going to pay more taxes I mean if their premises very simple\n... we're going to reduce the tax cuts are limited and spend more money and that's what that's always been the formula and Trump basically is you know some of the\nDiet can stop the excessive standing in basically a pill lord everybody's taxes or we should have got a booming economy and I think is by the last two days of this and the economy has benefited every American gr effectively\nAnd just go out and spell out would be universal Medicare for everyone will do and sixteenth senators including most of everybody all the senators who want to run for twenty twenty Cory Booker Kamala Harris jeweler brand and more and have said yeah we're for Medicare for all okay it's got a hung on it when he was in the house\nIt will destroy Medicare Medicare is a very strong program it was ... and it will basically destroy the sister that is very effective her and and I ... was people realize that ... plus unlimited spending a no control whatsoever uh\nIt it just won't work you know I think we have to fix the healthcare system I think we we leave the good halfway there last time and we need to come back in the fall and then next year and a modification we need to do something about preexisting what have you um but I think the reality is that what they're advocating as strict ... program\nAnd let me tell you they tried it and Bernie Sanders Vermont\nThey had a payroll taxes up eleven point five percent income tax a nine point five percent and they still were not able to pay for everybody that's a big state within that many people and they had to back out of it now he wants to a gym it down our throats and he's taken advantage of naive", "show_name": "Hugh
