I think that uh you know taking without just compensation is due for a resurrection as well and we're going to\nGet that this term and you're right you're right that I think they're going to overturn Williamson\nCounty this term and uh now that was one of the cases argued with argued last week before a judge\nThis was before they have to re hear it after a year or would you agree with me on the on the Fifth Amendment and John that regulatory takings is hot and I would look for that to change\nYes first I just think John ... states the law with regard to employment division versus Smith it says that strict scrutiny that the government has to be necessary achieve a compelling interest does testing that if the government was motivated by desire and religion\nFor if it's not a general visibility\nThe targets religion or religion so it's not just rational basis review it just says if the law wasn't motivated by desire and if it's religion and it applies to everyone\nThere is no exception to the law for religion but it's the a specific question I Do think there's going to be more protection of property rights civically under the Fifth Amendment clause that says the government can't take private property\nFor public is without just compensation\nBoth the all of us have to admit whether or not our opinions on the proceedings um differ that they had to be sharing an justice cabinet and they had to have been deeply deeply painful so Irwin do you expect that to be reflected in his consideration of cases involving the rights of the accused\nNo I mean I don't know him well but I don't think he's somebody who's going to be embittered by this and the long term I have confidence that he's gonna be the justice he would have been if all of this didn't happen there was undoubtedly deeply scarring for him is that the country\nJohnny's meant well I I think that's right you know a ... a a a justice I just wanted to what he did a could come out one of two ways a bitter and vote against the perceived ideological position of the folks that this\nIs to him for the rest of his life I don't say that justice capital as or he could say you know I'm going to prove to them that I'm not who they thought I was and and the rule in their direction for a number of it on a number of issues and I don't think that's his justice Kavanaugh is either\nLet let me finish by asking you gentleman just for a minute each on the impact the twenty Ninth Circuit appeals court justices confirmed by the Senate and nominated by Donald Trump or when\nIt's enormous Donald Trump's as quickly remaking the federal court of appeals its farm or almost twice as many as ... and they had in his first two years the vast majority of cases never make it to the Supreme Court last year the Supreme Court decided to fifty nine cases was signed opinions after briefing in a real argument that means the court\nOf appeals to get the last word over and again the Trump nominees are going to make a big difference\nJohnny Smith in the Ninth Circuit got three nominees finally I don't know if they'll make it through in the lame duck session but overall I don't know how any never Trump or looks at this and remains the never Trump or\nWell I I don't either I mean that this was a\nA is a bold move or during the campaign that President Trump did to bring a lot of folks on board\nA and and the never Trump or his uh have continued to oppose from despite that but it's that the evidence is is getting rather compelling an overwhelming now that Trump is fulfilling that pledge and ... and I want to be real clear not to remake the courts in a conservative instead of a liberal direction\nBut in my view to remake the court or in in the direction that says\nUm faithfully applying the law in the constitution as written as it was originally meant ah is is a limitation on our judicial power we did we don't get to be super legislators and and you know make it to keep up with the times as we

[noise]\n\n... we've got the house with the Democrats getting over two hundred and Eighteen seats that they would need to take it if the election were today we're now we've got the two hundred and twenty six seats in our model\nThat number has been creeping up slowly over the course of the summer as long as we've been doing these battleground trackers but\nIt's still very heavily dependent on at least two things for the Democrats and I just I Can't emphasize this enough it's dependent on turnout among people who don't typically vote in the terms and it's dependent on a few meaningful crossover voters coming from having voting for Donald Trump to voting Democrat now\nCall right at the monitor on face the nation is really good pollster and just saying this is the way it stands right now however on the Senate side where Labor Day the Senate looked in jeopardy for upper Republicans now they're saying oh we got the Senate\nBut can we get the house and bought tradition and a history with me in Studio is John Sununu and cruise to new new they're both very ah they're both very young looking men and a double very successful politicians in their own right first job that analysis what do you think uh governor's sooner or John\n... listen to what his assumptions were people that don't usually vote in in off year off president you your elections have to come out for the Democrats are\nThey they have been in my opinion confusing noise with enthusiasm and and the noise is on the fringe I'm not sure the noises all the way across I've been saying all along the Republicans will hold outs by a handful of seats\nThat would be as big a governor soon in the current governor to do for money because you understand the tradition exist it's only happened two or three hundred and fifty years\nI mean is that it would be absolutely huge and again when you when you see strong candidates come out\nOf all across the country I mean even in in New Hampshire we ever or two seats up there we have a Eddie Edwards have very strong candidate with a military background or running and see the one Steve Negron CD do seats at boat traditionally I think people would say oh well they they can't win absolutely they can win in the poll numbers show at the enthusiasm is out there\nSo um I mean I I think across the country are you going to see a lot of races that just shocked people for the Republican and you just informed me every two years you up to run for re every two years I have to run great great accountability I thought it was a great idea until it became governor then I liked it stunk [laughter] to raise money I got to ask people for help but a\n... year die I mean that's really what it's about that live free or die spirit in New Hampshire\nAnd I I'm for that except for the money part and the way you guys always have to raise money the way the house members of the raise money I that's what he wanted to do they have to raise money if they want to stay in their job and after a while it's exhausting but it only doing their job and guess what\nIf I give you money I have I've been here towards the issue and you should listen to me and then you wonder about how do I covered at the same time be true to my own\nAnd raising money stinks it's really hard and again I grew up you know we you didn't really ask people were held the kind of took care of yourself but you have to remember when you ask someone to make an investment and that's what it is yes or a business\nLeader or a family to make an investment they're making an investment in themselves because they want that change they want to a more of an ability for themselves more flexibility for their business whatever it might be so that's an investment for them to make an and when you walk through it it's it's wonderful to see people come out in support you they're knocking on doors they're putting up signs all that I mean do politics matters\nJudge new I Know you saw the Bush's lately forty one and forty three ah I Know the Kavanaugh was something that brought the Trump and Bush family together because on an issue but not shoulder to shoulder do you see these two getting together anytime the Bush family the Trump family getting together anytime soon\nWhile I was so pleased that the but the George W. Bush work of\nArt to get the president's selection of Kevin across it won't count all over three times you ate it many times and and and he called lots of other senators so I Hope that that does catalyze ... return of or relationship between the two family a little bit\n... principal ... to ... these very critical of the Bush administration and I think it's unnecessary shots they takes on forty three\nI'm hoping that this new a Donald Trump the we talked about at the beginning of the show\nTurns out to a move 'em in the right direction that was Christian or he's doing great that takes after his mother so he does very for who I\nDon't know what it used to be the governor of New Hampshire and they both let me know how they feel stake guys are great have any in Studio ... coming up next time better than a real clear politics right until mid show Monday say there [noise]\nDown in the middle on on the issues and she's not I don't think she's able to be demonized in the same way that Kelly Ward would have been attacked by by Christmas in a\nCouple of things I think I'm fascinated by this they were really cutting on gender lines because it's clear according to at least the ABC poll and then things did you hear\nThat on gender lines or the female vote seems to be going predominantly with Democrats and the male boat predominantly with by smaller margin with Republicans insist something can be done in the next three and a half weeks to change that if you're a Republican or Democrat\nNo probably not I mean we certainly that has been one of the defining features of this election right women were the gender gap is is a historic highs we've never seen it this high it's\nIn some cold it's it's thirty points uh you know women are breaking for Democrats and the twenty to twenty five percent range men are breaking for Republicans in the five and ten percent range so it is either to store but\nThat I think is is a little bit too simplistic it because women are not a monolithic voting block I mean those are married women\nRight no I don't know how I've never I haven't met two women that are\nAlive [laughter] right so so it's it's particular groups of women that are breaking hard minority women single women breaking very hard for Democrats are married women and women without college degrees are much more in favor of Republican so you got to take a look at the state you got to take a look in a district\nOnly just tell you the people that just came out or the Democrats have forty three percent of the boat and fifty percent of the women vote or the Republicans a fifty percent of the mental thirty eight percent of the women vote that's how it breaks down\nThe other thing I think is interesting is the president says you're voting for me\nHe's saying would Brock Obama didn't say or tried to say and fell on his face with Bill Clinton was told to get off the stump and stop campaigning actually hurting candidate on his terms or ... I don't really remember what Bush said on his\nBut right now the president being a factor thirty five percent of voters said yes and and that's why I'm supporting him those who oppose him thirty eight percent yeah I'm boating just to oppose them twenty seven percent said it's not about him\nYeah look mature as a referendum on President whether you acknowledge it or not Trump clearly acknowledging it but I don't think that's what\nThat was always going to be the case what happened in the last ten days two weeks since the cabinet is not about Donald Trump it's about Republicans in the Senate it's about Mitch McConnell not being seen as sort of a hero for having the strength and courage to sort of push this through when\nYou know look one of the reason Trump was elected was because Republicans were dissatisfied with Republican leadership they didn't like Mitch McConnell he had a terrible favorable approval rating among Republicans that is completely flipped around now\nAnd it's unify the party so the energy coming not necessarily from from Trump but from Republicans in Washington you know it's interesting too\nAnd you tell me if they showed up in the polls that we know there's a lotta never Trump there is on the right there was I don't remember seeing any never Obama's and very few of aid to Bill Clinton when they had the impeachment thing well some people seem to have gotten him back\nBut when when when you Brett Kavanaugh you really had a Bush favorite son and when things got trouble for Brett Kavanaugh George Bush was working as hard as Donald Trump they were on the same page that allow a road in for the never Trump ... well\nIt certainly wasn't the case and we saw anecdotally um that you know you had folks like Brad Stevens who was one of the lead never Trump has come out with a column saying thank God for Donald Trump Erick Erickson who was one of the original never Trump or saying I'm voting for Trump and twenty twenty because of this issue in particular so\nThere are certainly anecdotal evidence to to suggest that the never Trump hers are now sort of have been have been welded due to Trump because of this issue but\nIt's not really showing up at the polls because they never traumas will never that big they were allowed but there were lab very loud it was because they are exactly cause they occupy spots in the media McCain exactly but but as far as how big they were as a percentage of the Republican base is it was never that big and so it's not it's not generating a big bump in the in the numbers for for Trump\nI've been watching a lot of the rallies and they are even loud for rallies and especially when the cabinet things started heating up and it'll be in an uproar is So Peter Baker the New York times so I think it's fair and I also think he wrote a very ... about Bush forty one of which forty three cut twenty three I meet the press\nHas to Israel as this week in Iowa and in Pennsylvania the target of the crowd the crowd loves them there are thousands of people there there are people outside waiting to get and that that can be ephemeral that can also be allusion Aretha any present as we know the fact that President Bush\nLook back at President Obama had big crowds during the term elections they were not on about that last ah sixteenth and those are like I said this doesn't necessarily meaning but it does pumped him up and he's no longer and that sort of a restrained kind of like things are going to go bad a mode and he's on the fence rather than any fat\n[noise] look I agree I mean you crowd to cross can be deceptive sometimes a girl can be just as if you remember in twenty twelve Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan had their final rally in Ohio and they had twenty five thirty thousand people I mean it was a huge deal everyone thought oh my gosh this is it looking each crowds\nUm conversely a but obviously it turned out not to be true conversely Donald Trump had huge crowds in twenty sixteen and that was sort of indicative of the movement on now look a bit of work down in Texas He generating big crowds there there's no question about it he's got energy energy and the base\nBut does that translate into votes I'm not necessarily and certainly not enough votes that he's going to need to win that race site or if you're getting around I have to run\nOkay then I'm going to give you my last question out okay I'm right now the FiveThirtyEight group says eighty percent chance Republican called the house and use me hold the Senate and increase elite eighty percent chance the house loses a house goes split because the Democrats those real clear a echo that\nSo we we don't run models like that and we don't usually averages we do average and we don't put statistical probability on it but what we do one of the things that we do do is if we have these no tossup maps so if the election were held today based on where the polls Dana right now\nAs I mentioned earlier in the house Democrats would pick up an average of twenty four and a half feet so they would win this they would win out by one seat or Republicans would pick up two seats in the Senate based on the pulse and right now\nSo I lied one more question Hispanics the big the big deception is is that a run for the president because his rhetoric on the wall and his uh problems with the immigration and and catch and release and things to that nature but it's not coming out in the polls why\nIt's not because again Hispanics are not a monolithic block monolithic voting bloc and what we're seeing in the data is that younger Hispanics or not has energized a vote but older Hispanics aren't or Hispanics are more traditional more conservative\nUm and and so they typically vote more Republican which is why you're seeing Ted Cruz getting three percent in taxes Dean Heller getting thirty percent of Hispanic vote in Nevada those numbers hold up\nIn hell or getting thirty percent of Hispanic vote in Nevada those numbers hold up\nI'm going to be a bad night for Democrats I cannot give up that much of Hispanic so many states Tom Bevan thanks so much real clear politics dot com or that's where to go
