them first to Wright Patt\nI think it's a fair question him as a question that we have to ask a of the military or the only response I could I could muster right now is that that in itself is an expensive proposition right and you know it's always hard to predict uh how ... how heavy storms are going to be no one certainly thought it was going to hit\nTend to all the way it did a Michael was initially supposed to be a tropical storm for that area before Kindle took a direct hit and so I think it's a fair question hopefully from this we can\nIdentify some key lessons learned um we can avoid making the same mistake in the future but again we need the appropriate DOD officials to testify before the house armed services committee to figure out exactly what's happening here because of course the air force is putting their spin on it it's hard to get an accurate picture of exactly what happened and who made the decision\nYou know I read that it would require ten million dollars to reopen the line\nAnd I thought to myself ... next to nothing compared to the strategic advantage this particular plane gives us over our near tear are near peer China I mean not it really is almost nothing is going to go back and start producing these planes do you think we should\n[noise] well I might ask that I see and it said it would take two billion in five years to restart the line but it just a question of what timeframe or some since you're making\nThe line but I just question of what timeframe or the substance you're making you get the length of the production on I think I I tend to disagree although more planes will be better and obviously you did it go back and look at that without ... with\nA lot of progress but we really need to do is we look through the prism of this long Charlie great power competition with China\nAnd the capabilities China's developing is we need to accelerate the beat Twenty one production in order to get range back into the air force and therefore reallocate some of the ballots from fighters to bomber that's really the challenge that it was ended by China and rising great powers and so we need to get that range back ideally you could do a bit of both but\nYou know resource constrained environment you have to make very difficult decisions like that\nBut right now let's talk about what you wrote for real clear defense this week about but maybe what you summarize what your article is and people can find it by Googling Mike Gallagher in real clear defense\nWell he was you know I'm Irish Catholic so I'm always walking around with guilt over things I did and didn't do and I felt guilty after our discussion last week I did it feel like an answer your question about where's the plant for three and a fifty five ships and so I went and I started writing my thoughts on paper and talking to a a bunch of people because as you pointed out\nA three hundred and fifty five ships leave was that they can get your defense campaign promise that then candidate Trump and basically the vice president's talking to that state you know there's more to follow I don't think that the capital right now the question is is a navy backtrack we had a two thousand six team for structure assessment\nThat endorsed that three hundred and fifty five ship number\nNow since then we've had a change in administration\nAnd the new defense strategy and in light of these changes it makes sense that the navy wants to review the size and composition of its future flee the problem however is the way in which this was happening\nBack in March the navy told us that they were planning on conducting a new force structure assessment then they re announced a forthcoming new ... just last month do some time and twenty Nineteen\nWhat we don't really know is what they've been doing in the thick and thin between his announcement or why the new study won't be out until more than one year after the end the U.S so I guess if I could summarize\nWhy are we commissioning a whole host of new studies when we have the three hundred and fifty five shit number that's been endorsed by the navy itself\nBy numerous out that assessment and by the president himself as we know from the experience of the Reagan Administration the window to make change ramp up is really in the first two years of administrative\nAnd tasks that the bureaucracy starts doing it they it ... the status quo and so I see here we are missing a key windows here and I want the navy to tell us what's going to come from these new staff because at the assessment comes back that just kidding we only need three hundred and thirty ships\nFor whatever reason that is unacceptable\n[noise] do you think the president is aware that he's being slow roll by the navy bureaucracy 'cause that's what I think is happening and I had Richard Spencer on when I had an MSNBC show show no nowhere to get your plan and honestly I I think the president thinks there is a plan out there for two hundred and fifty five ships and nobody tells them no it's not there\nAre no I don't think he's aware listen to the president is that is a busy man he's got a thousand things to worry about he needs to expect\nThat when he gives a clear direction to his service secretary of to his his his checked our defense and the service secretary that data executed with a lack of dirty and so I don't think the president as sitting there having this discussion I think your interview with ...\nHopefully will serve as a wake up call for the White House but it's going to take that presidential level involvement pushing the navy pushing the department of defense to go as fast as humanly possible because if you're actually will always invent excuses and you could fashion a strategic rationale as an excuse for not building worship\nWell I Hope you are right I've just re tweeted out everybody ought to go and read my Gallagher's calm but maybe the nation need now in real clear defense and congressman\nGood luck to you by this week this time tomorrow if we got to be talking about the browns and I honestly I don't know if they're in Rogers can make it to the halfway point of the students

was amazing new book or capitalism in America history he loves the Trump tax cuts he says\nHistory he loves the Trump tax cuts he says there were not politically correct but they've done what needed to be done in order to unleash the animal spirits Alan Greenspan's Alan Greenspan Stephanie it's pretty tough to argue with him\nAre you sure he said he loves the Trump tax cuts or sit there constructive\nHe loved them a lot but they were politically incorrect now what he does it well because we haven't done entitlement reform drug company that I Want to come into that but he loves the drunk tax cuts\nWell one of the things about settlement reform that we don't need as it surprises me the young people don't get more engaged on entitlement reform yet you know they sort of latch on to issues that you know are very very popular in the news the entitlement reform or something I think people should really care about\nThat isn't the issue with the tax cut is\nIt's a clear positive for corporate America ... as it was far too complicated but\nThe amount of taxes that they cut you could ask Jamy diamond he will say listen I'm Glad we got the tax cuts we didn't need it to be as much as it is because we are facing I'm I'm massive deficit\nAnd as far as the tax cut goes where's hand corporations do so well two weeks ago I the business council summit there had been a hunter fortune five hundred years they're\nTickled pink and they're saying they're spending their investing their hiring and even without the tax cuts deregulation has been a huge positive for corporate America\nBecause remember in the Obama administration it was not a pro business administration that and even if companies weren't face new taxes the threat of of regulations of the rat\nA more could be coming down the pike was preventing companies from spending your definitely think corporate America in a very good place to look at the stock market one of the reason the stock market is doing so well suddenly corporations have twice as much cash on the books\nSo it is a positive we obviously have a very tight labor market time to see wages push up more than they have this far\nSeventy roll

you sense\nThat the blue tight is a thing of the past and then in fact we're looking at a red\nTide and I've talked about this a lot I've never seen a massive blue wave coming the thing that distresses me is an inch are we going massive lure math and read the thing that distresses me is the hollowing out of the center on both sides that is what I think is the most concerning and I think we're seeing it in both parties\nThat did you read David Brooks piece yesterday about the eight percent on the line you know it all on it today how are you really 'cause that's the most interesting thing but the noise comes from those two groups that minority and by the way our cable channels both left and right the that noise I don't know how we're ever going to break out of this\nCue you are one hundred percent correct on to use an example story on Monday when I woke up I wasn't on TV I heard what\nNot and media of thought of what Hillary Clinton said on Monday on Sunday about her husband and Monica Lewinsky okay saying it was not an abuse of power\nSo I said via Twitter say something clear when the president of the United states has a sexual encounter with an intern it doesn't matter how she behaved blah blah blah that's an abusive talent I'm not saying it's rats that I'm not saying it's it's just all it is an abuse of power when I tell you you I got\nAnd now I Am laid on Twitter and I should hold on a second\nYou know because of course I wanted what about ... what am I ... and I said both things can be true abusive power is not unique to one industry one sport uh one one nation or one political party but the tribalism we are seeing the absolute forgiveness of one side\nAnd an assault of another must stop it's unreasonable\nJust is going to be very difficult to break away from the profit motive of super serving the six in the eight percent but I'm Glad you're doing the day but that's what's why watch jeopardy real she can do to David okay go on at\nThat moment at Brooks column is the smartest thing I've wrecked in ages\nMan that's definitely real good to talk to ... on Twitter America and of course on MSNBC don't go anywhere I'm coming right\nBack America

pollsters have told him to come out on the attack so if he wants to insult man call\nI agree with that there's one exception to that which is the Georgia governor's race I was in Al Sharpton this

and we're going to come back to the job versus robbed in the second\nOne safe havens when I meet the press this weekend and talked about voter suppression I viewed that as a concession speech a that's not how you when you normally when on positive\nAh developments in pushing agendas and health care and jobs or education not on complaining about fifty three thousand voter matches that that was her her big patch trying to energize and I think what they discovered\nBecause if they don't have any energy or that that you may be the economy is so big and the the match ups like Kevin Cramer over Heidi Heitkamp and Martha McSally ever Christian cinema have just taken the wind out of Democrats you do you think I monitor something here\nWell yeah I think the Kavanaugh effect is very real the economy\nUm that's a big deal to write um so how do you fire people up for some reason I've talked to pollsters about this\nFor some reason and ethnic minorities African Americans and Hispanics don't really hate Donald Trump it's really hard to understand why but remember on The Apprentice for some reason his number one demographic is number one and we're actually African American\nTrump has said horrible thing but for some reason\nThey don't they don't really have Donald Trump the people who really despise and lows Donald Trump and have the energy for some reason tend to be college educated single white women and so I think it's no surprise that that was the attack\nOr that sort of ended up being pushed that was the angle from the cabin all going forward I really think and I'm sure we can find\nCongressional districts out there where that's not the case I'm sure we can find you know local races where you know the idea will be to turn out African Americans against the Republican but for some reason when it comes to Donald Trump I think\nThat the one group who really is going to be the problem it's much more about the gender gap that I think it has anything else\nAnd it will be interesting to see whether or not um that gender gap\nIndoors at the level that some in the Media Project that will I don't think it's going to let me close mad I Do want to talk about jobs versus mobs I found that amazing that the left we're coiled in fear from the term mobs when that was very clearly mobs\n... why is that why did they not want the antifa Portland video to go viral why did they not want people pounding on the Supreme Court could be called them up what is it that they're reacting against\nI actually don't understand the phenomenon to be quite Frank with you I mean why that's why we I don't understand why the push back because first of all\nI think I've been pretty consistent at call any ... that sort of Charlottesville and sing yeah and then so but when the left does it when they chased Ted Cruz out of ... out of a restaurant\nWhen they pound on the doors at the Supreme Court um I call that a mob and I I actually they somehow viewed that as like almost like an existential threat I don't really understand it I don't think that's an indictment on liberalism on mob on on the streets with pitch for\nI I had one theory as to why which is when you mobs are interesting and if you've identified a mob and it hasn't been covered it uncovers an underlying biased in favor of covering only mobs that hurt Republicans not mobs that hurt Democrats what do you think of my theory\n[noise] yeah I mean I guess there's a lot and it's certainly some people I Would say have an interest in\nFraming this perception that the right wing or violent and mild like and the left wing or protesters who are young civil rights act it I mean\nLike I don't understand why the person with calories on that I don't think that's going to determine the election or really which side as white but clearly some people are pushing that agenda\nIs what it is it's it's a personal indictment of the story selection that is the key Matt Lewis always good to talk to my friend Matt K

married in Nineteen sixty came United States in Nineteen sixty two I hatched in Nineteen sixty three\nI guess what my mom and dad did when they want to come United States America they went to the U.S embassy in San jose Costa Rica and they fill up the paperwork they got their beat says they got their passport stamped and then they came United States that's all people like me ask it's all the people on the right at\nIt's almost Americans that's when it come to America great fill out the ... I don't think that's too much\nThat I Do think we got to streamline that process and making quicker for people that have been here and have green cards and doing it the right way much expert I damn uh you know we were talking to a ... of farming communities they desperately need workers let's find a way to get a guest worker program that ultimately right and I am not for Tom\nCotton plant a lesson immigration I Want qualified people hear one of the few countries there are growing you know how much the Russians with love people the Europeans love people no one's going there but to really I Want to get to the premise of your column you believe the best thing to happen to the Democratic party will be for them to lose because of how they're trying to win\nOr lose lose big and this is what's so important we've seen over the last few weeks with the Kavanaugh a crisis in so much the way the Democrats and the left to behave themselves you know screaming or sending like a band she's screaming from the gallery\nOf the U.S Senate during the final vote on Kavanaugh a screaming at Ted Cruz and other people chasing them out of restaurants are you seeing vandalism against a GOP offices from Wyoming to Nebraska even here on the Upper East side of Manhattan uh offices torch vandalism this kind of thing\nAnd I think if the if the Democrats win if they win either or God Forbid both houses of Congress are going to get a peach Mitt Medicare for all the Democrats socialist agenda or that will continue if they are barely lose if if the Republicans hang on you know just by a thread\nOr the Democrats are going to blame it on Russia they're going to blame it on white nationalism a racism whatever you want\nI think only if the Democrats the Republicans deliver a crushing blow against the Democrats only then will have to sit down\nFocus realize you know it's not Trump is not rush it's not ... it's a it's a bad message it's the resistance is the violence the mob rule and then I think they may engage in some self reflection and trying to think about okay what positive agenda what positive message can we present to improve the lives of American\nPie the over the next two years that the president wants to put a stake through the heart of only white people vote for him who want to go back to old America pre civil war you spend your time focusing on Hispanics and blacks\nAnd you just say Yuri helping them these opportunities zones are happening things are taking place they don't trumpet them at all but I Want the president to go back in and do the McCain style town halls and take a step back\nTo do your rallies with your friends but also try to convert the ones they're not and I think that will begin to bring people together I understand what you're saying that I consider that when Kanye West in Israel and said I Am not first stop and frisk it doesn't mean he's a bad person he disagrees with the president ... we'll talk about that\nThat's the beginning of getting somewhere and marginalizing your enemies I\nThink that's absolutely right and I think that um let the President Trump in the ... you have an excellent message to bring into black communities that we can talk about the fact that the black unemployment rate is at the lowest in us history\nWhen the economy grows that are about four percent versus about two percent under Obama double what we were told a couple of years ago was the new normal and the ceiling on growth that got just go for white people that go for black people it's good for spending cuts for everybody in this country and he ought to go into black neighborhoods in and been preached this and it's very hard to accuse him of being a racist weights black people who's actually meeting with black people\nRight or at once it might might might not say things like her show Walker Jim Brown their friends have had to go with people that need to be converted to do it in a civil way I'll begin to change the tone ... who's the most ... what is the most effective way that a Democrat can counter the present\nThe most effective message for the Democrats are they all trying to play the game Elizabeth Warren's trying to play a game ... trying to play this game Cory Booker is trying to play the game they're not going to win that way well the thing the funny thing is that they're right through they they they grab as bait Everytime he offers at you know with Elizabeth Warren decided okay I'll get a DNA test that'll show him\nAnd it kind of explode in her face and she's a\n... at most one sixty fourth jerky I I'm One eats Chinese my great grandpa came from either ... or ... or Hong Kong or you can't get into Harvard you just ... you know how it goes to ...\nUh I Am eight times more Chinese than a Elizabeth Warren is Cherokee at at at most for her but why should do any she's playing this game she settle the right point is she doing in all of their head incredible\nAnd she ... she could have stuck to her message talked about getting more people and they involve the economy or talk about corporate a justice quote unquote whatever she wants to whatever messages but now she's a detracted distracted on that the Democrats are running around talking about ancestry dot com and all this and that's that's a pretty weak message for them to\nDeliver I drew agrees with you Jim Messina David ... two Democratic strategist who cannot believe that she did\nThat and the Senate race to invest about twenty twenty ... ah it's really thanks so much try to follow them everywhere when we come back from kind of colonel Allen West\nTo dispose of his body and that matter we cannot accept that we can I can do that and so there has to be ramifications of consequences for Saudi Arabia\nAnd if this young man it's got to be the face of Saudi right we'd have to say what a push away I think that we have to move away from this either or thing we have to be embraced Saudi Arabia more because you know Iran is so bad no we we don't need to associate with any type of heinous\nAbhor behavior like we have seen just recently out of Saudi Arabia\nWell we don't and you know the big ... the flip side to this China and Russia move and clear that they don't mind making the sale\n[laughter] well that's true but the other thing that we need to do that's why the economic sanctions and our economic growth is so important\nAnd we are gathering up the allies on our side to put more pressure on China and Russia without without a doubt we see China that is you know cozying up in Pakistan we see Russia and what they're trying to do and the middle east especially with Syria\nBut there there's a clear cut a path for the United states of America and if we accept this type of behavior we don't you know come down on Saudi Arabia not only are you going to get more that behavior but it's going to lessen our stance and and the world as well\nYeah I mean they evidently does it ... that's good and he was exiled\nAnd he was interrogated and cram rented pretended to be good is the one is actually in charge they turned out the Turkish ship it concluded that they painted the whole place they also broadening the cleaning crew to clean up the whole plates\nAnd the one of the people that was involved with a fitted with the twelve man team that landed and went into the consulate is known to be very tight with the crown prince\nAnd on top of that the consul general had disappeared so he's not available for questioning the worst most ill thought out brutal assassination with massive ramifications than I've ever seen it's so stupid and horrific you wonder if we're missing something\n[laughter] well it was definitely premeditated but the other thing is that it shows an incredible a level of belligerence\nAnd the ... to ... matter of the Saudis and that will do something like this and we dare anyone to challenges we dare anyone to\nYou know ... bring any consequences against us so this is an important stats or the United states of America just the same as we were tough on North Korea we brought them to the table we got to be tough all Saudi Arabia say look there's always this ... this guy has this control this power\nWhat other do business with you and if that means that you're going to be catching you know rockets and missiles from the who the rebels out of Yemen so be it\nA real quick on immigration I Want to get a question now your book uh the the maybe the futures because the house Nancy Pelosi talked about why the president needs to build a wall its own insecurity the audio is not grade up by the way either her comments but they weren't sharing cut Seventeen\nAnd\nAll\n\nI\nReally I mean the end they laugh while\nThose type of delusional comment so the reason why she won't be the speaker of the house but\nI think that NASA Pelosi should ask you know ... if they're concerned about you know their manhood because the Vatican has a wall\nOr she should call up a is the Israelis and asked them about their matter because they've built a wall to stem the flow of terrorism coming to their country but yet and still there you know get a rocket and in missile attacks we just saw the most recent one coming out of Gaza\nSo we've got to do something because we are sovereign nation and the sovereign nation has to be able to control is borders we do not have control over our borders\nI Can't argue a ... on hold taxes hold a nation what is going on in Texas to meet you say I got to tell the country\nThe famed it is happening in Texas is happening all across the the the entire country is that you know six or businesses and corporations are moving it to a successful read space to have the right economic policies regulatory policies\nBut as these businesses and corporations are moving in there not explained it to their employees while they're moving there\nAnd so you are seeing an incredible ideological shift\nIn Georgia and Tennessee and Texas and North Carolina and that is going to be very threatening for the future of these states because for whatever reason is a locust that fact as I call it where people are coming out of California Illinois New York New Jersey and they're still bringing their failed policies quicker to successful steaks\nAnd you're witnessing any taxes you'd think Texas is changing without\nA doubt when like I always tell people you look at your major urban centers and Texas and you look at the college and university as a matter of fact I wrote about today Texas woman's university has a restricted people who apply free speech dissolves\nNow that's the University of Texas Public University of Texas is saying you all have five free speech designated as I was on his campus\nThat's that shows that something is happening at Texas this is not Massachusetts was not Vermont is about California\nUh I got to bring you to a ... all this on on Texas in particular do you believe that uh in Florida in taxes in these other places in in Georgia do you do you think the Republican Party is is being caught napping\nI think that the Republican Party lacks a strategic vision a but yet you see that strategic vision on the other side look the northern Virginia dictates the politics of the state of Virginia and they've been able to flip a Virginia Colorado I used to be a red state in ... now is blue and his base on Denver and Boulder\nUh the major those major population centers and where you have these major colleges and universities so I think that the Republican Party of nice to have more strategic vision and and they used to go into these major urban centers where you see the greatest amount of failure of progress a socialist policies and they need to make the argument\nRight and by the way to turn the latest poll and the real clear average cruised by seven it was a one or two points race but he seems to be pulling away so if Texas who's gonna flip go blue like with the LBJ days or not there yet or not close now colonel\nOver okay you get the book you could order on Amazon and whole Texas hold the next with Victor at that and I want to say ... kilometer lots of gap where his incredible of doors for it and you just a good their friend appreciate you\nActually in my next book and got to be Sam Houston avenge in the Alamo\nAbsolutely and my next book it's gotta be Sam Houston avenge and the Alamo and it's all about Travis and that was the line he used before he would eventually sadly get death\nOr I Will get to the end victory or death so um I definitely understand
