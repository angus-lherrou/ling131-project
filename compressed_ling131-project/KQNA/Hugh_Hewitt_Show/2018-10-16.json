thought about culture or each other\nI think it's because we don't have the natural tribes that were used to as the place that you find happiness we have a collapsing nuclear family structure we have fewer deep friends than we've ever had and statistics on that stuff\nWe have declining local worshipping communities and we have shorter duration jobs so political tribalism is ramping up because it and politics politics matters but it doesn't matter all that much if not the center of life\nBut politics is trying to fill a void as people's neighborhoods that are collapsing and we should be attending to the first things first which is not politics\nOr if I'm In for a bomb in the house uh watching uh watching on my Apple TV and then I pick up my iPhone um taxing a bunch of people and interacting with people that don't exist yet I don't see you said that the one from average amount of Americans with friends have three friends three point something\nIt's down to like one point something now you have is it because the technology is a huge part\nOf it so I thank you for reading the book by the way we have half as many friends in America today as we did twenty five years ago the average American is three and a half friends in Nineteen Ninety today one point eight as you say\nAnd so the the smartphone has great lots of wonderful economic things come from her smartphone but make sure you turn the dang thing off tonight and have dinner with your kids because it turns out that matters so much more than your smart phone if you go from two hundred five hundred and social media friends you're not happy are statistically if you know the neighbor two doors down you're happier\nBut you're just saying these right now America is for the most part a lonely\nVery lonely you talked to researchers at the national institutes of health they think that loneliness as the number one public health crisis in America it drives most of obesity for instance being lonely for a day is the equivalent of smoking Fifteen cigarettes I Want people to read them because I Want them to be healthy or not just physically but in their neighborhood\nBut we can't you know it's very frustrating to hear well the nuclear family has gone away and we hear a lot of the minority communities that's part of the way I Do about that makes me want to throw in my hands and say what am I supposed to do about everybody else making decisions not to have nuclear family yes so\nThe first thing you should do is invite people over in your neighborhood you got lots of listeners who are blessed to have a stable nuclear family there are a bunch of kids who don't know their dad two blocks from you invite 'em over for dinner hosted a coach little league joined the Rotary Club joined want us all that stuff is more important than who you're angry at in politics again politics matters\nBut it's way downstream from the stuff that really matters which is probably within five minutes of your out\nThat's very interesting thing we could all do but here you are a knee deep in Washington the big policy the emotion lose Lindsey Graham said that was being spit on two weeks ago being spit on by people I've never met before Senator Jeff flake is being accosted in elevators by a woman he's ever seen before\nYeah ... is being accosted in elevators by a woman he's ever seen before so how does someone to look at that and think ... book really spelled out how that happened\nYes so I I've had those experiences to we I mean I think everybody like life gets death threats now\nI my kids I have three kids aging from a ranging from age seven to Seventeen we host water stations that local marathons and people come up and and scream that when the water when I hand it to a twenty year old woman running buying the marathon they'll scream don't drink at its toys and he wants to kill you\nThey think they're doing that because we differ about legislative issues there is something much deeper wrong in their life if they're willing to scream that I'm trying to poison somebody went on volunteering at a water station\nThe only way you can make that stuff's better is in the neighborhood where you live that can't be made better by legislation in Washington you can't pass a bill that mandates people become friends but your listeners need to become better at being friends in a world where the smartphone is telling us we don't have to live where we are so if\nYou have an example of Washington and working across the aisle or with a buddy let's say humor was more likeable and he felt like you could work with him I'm so Jeff Flake said this on sixty minutes and I think it applies here\nSenator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder cooking who have done this\nIf you were running or not you're not a chance you\nBecause politics has become too sharp to Portland ... there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWell that's the problem that's the identity but is that the reason you shouldn't I mean if if ... somebody of like mind they could cut a deal with on the other side are you concerned about you a political future if you do it\nNo I don't care about that stuff I Want to eight people out of a hundred and the Senate has never been a politician before and when my wife and I decided to run a we said for four and a half of the next six years will act like we're never run for reelection so we're due to\nPray about it and NATO and I've talked to some wise counselors in July and August mixture make decisions about our future but I don't worry about political incumbency has a core motivator for me um but the problem is Washington DC is filled with political addicts those are not normal people people who want to go to Washington DC and stay their whole life\nThey aren't good representative to the people listening to your show we need term limits we need people who want to be from a you know all the community of Syracuse New York and and Fremont, Nebraska and want to go back to those places because that's the place where you love those are the communities that really matter\nBut there's also the fact that we'd save spaces at colleges or the fact that they sent therapist to dorms after the election does that play into why you wrote this book\nYeah that that's a mess we do to touch on the type space movement or in this book I was a college president before I ran for Senate and one of the reasons moms and dads should be writing checks to send your kids to college is so that you encounter ideas you didn't already know if you want to go to a college where you know after never have to encounter any idea you didn't already know I don't know why you'd spend any money that's called education\nI don't want my kids to be safe from New ideas I Want him to encounter new ideas but I Want to do it in the context of human relationship where after you argue about philosophy or politics or whatever you want to go get a drink with somebody and have dinner with them\nBecause they're actually still humans create an image of God\nSo when you decide for example I think he might be a good example you told me something I didn't I Know you've been critical of the president not at his policies but a lot of it is is a is a is demeanor a lot of the way approaches do things but you do still talk to the president\nOh I Do I I like talking to the president and I'm grateful that he's willing to to take my call so we wrestle through issues I think he's done a great job bought a bunch of cyber issues for instance and I've been present on that and I wanted to take a tiny bit issue but I it demeanor obviously there's a ton of stuff the president does which is new that a lot of people are just having a rough all through and make sense of\nMy my their issues where I agree with the president and policy their issues where I disagree and he's grateful I'm grateful that he's willing to to wrestle with me and have a conversation\nWhat I'm really worried about though is not this president or the election of twenty twenty I'm worried about what kind of country we live our kids in ten and Twenty years\nAnd we need to be having long term conversations about what America's about why we have limited government why we should do entitlement reform and the kind of stuff we talked about in them which is America believe in limited government because it's out of the world is your community not\nThe center you live in a state that likes uh there's like ... what are the so called fly over state that people are ignoring before Fox came along I Would argue that Los Angeles DC and New York\nA ... program every single sitcom and every news broadcasts we didn't try to do that or an audience came in different what do you know in Nebraska that New York DC and California doesn't\nGod that even though we're all insects right now the cars are still the football team in the last ... years in every state are you you got to get ready for the for the best of luck fifty years I granted we're really good from fifty until about Seventeen years ago I might as well we'll be back yeah go ... elite us back to the promised land\nRight but football side do you guys you guys are not caught up in Nebraska and you're not in the play by play you're not into the ... century\nNo I think the vast majority of Nebraska and know\nThat the really important things that happened in the world are what kind of character your kids going to have two months and two years from now credits about whether or not the people in their neighborhoods want to go to the same neighborhood gym\nNext Saturday Night and cheer on the same team even if we differ about politics politics can't be the center of your life it can't fill the vacuum of the worry we all have in our soul who's going to comfort us on her deathbed that's going to be family and friends and coworkers is not going to be some politician off in Washington\nYeah I agree with you see the iPhone also has some things in it now the lead they will tell you how long you been looking at it what you've been doing and ... and parents can get involved in that just like they get they tell you who you can hang out with when you're younger they could tell you about your iPhone\nYeah that's exactly right again the thought has lots of benefits but the average Americans checking it every four minutes and it's not healthy for a Fifteen year olds there's a whole chapter in them about how to think about the right and the wrong way use technology in your family\nThe name of the book at them why we hate each other and how to heal ... Center for Nebraska said oh it's great to have in Studio ... [noise]\nIt's amazing to or if you think about uh the humiliation yet do you think humility has something to do with great leadership some still you chose a weakness to say I don't know what somebody else's ideas come out and not be yours Becker chill vulnerability we're does humidity and vulnerability commit\nSome way some for some reason in today's world it seems vulnerable to admit weaknesses in the earlier days certainly for Abraham Lincoln when he runs for office the first time it's a wonderful statement he makes every man has has peculiar ambition monitors to be a steam do by my fellow man\nBut I'm not sure up you'll understand me and I'm not sure if you vote for me\nAnd if I Do lose I won't be too chagrin because I'm familiar with disappointment but then he says but I'm going to try five or six times until I'm too humiliated\nAnd then I won't try again I promise but he said in that opening statement if I don't know something I'm going to learn it if I say something wrong I'm going to correct it right from the start he comes out of the gate with those qualities of resilience humility and empathy and they stay with them the rest of his life\nWill tell me ... you could take lunch or notice book on grand talks about how grant ruined were slaves who had after the emancipation was issued more and more slaves were decided to run for freedom\nAnd when they were running to grant who was grants idea to say let's get these guys some uniforms and let them fight and he sees how they fall they got together and the galvanizing came into a unit and that's when we can search getting an idea of how what the world with the country's going to look like when this war is over\nThem I think that's right once the black soldiers became part of the union army as they did when he finally opened the door to the black soldiers they fought magnificently and even the general to been against the idea of bringing them into the army began to see that they're helping the cause and they're doing an amazing job\nBut Lincoln was reluctant at first to do it I mean he waited and waited until Nineteen sixty three\nBecause he feared that the whites in the army weren't ready for it he fit the north even the north wasn't ready timing is everything he said so we watch the changing sentiment he watch what was beginning to happen and that's another quality of a leader you can't do what you may want to do unless the timing us write the timing was perfect for the Emancipation Proclamation and for allowing blacks in the army\nEven though it was driving Frederick Douglass nuts because he was waiting so long right exactly\nBut Frederick Douglass said once Lincoln takes a stand on something he'll never go back he maybe slow getting there but it's true I mean it when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation there was a lot of blow back in the north north and license legislatures passed\nRules saying or a statements saying we're not for this and we didn't fight for this where just for the union and some of them were threatening to secede from New England and yet Lincoln knew that the timing would be okay that they would come around and they finally did and then Douglas finally accepted yet you are right on time and\nWell a Doris Kearns Goodwin here so if there was a natural leader even though we started off grew up sickly and he was somebody had to be home schooled they had to be Teddy Roosevelt it seems he built up his body because you couldn't early he did the lady became physical weight because he couldn't early right\nNow you know what's so interesting about ... that he made himself a strong person and that became an example are for the rest of his life he said one time there were two\nUm concerts except in the world some is when somebody has a talent that nobody else can develop no matter how hard they try like a cheap for a poem or Lincoln at Gettysburg but most people have said like in South\nHave ordinary talents that they develop to an extraordinary degree too hard to sustain before he was he wasn't a good eyesight person but he was a great bird or he wasn't that good of a shot but it became a world class hunter\nUm he wasn't a good boxing but he somehow lost an eye at one point but he became a good boxer everything came to hardworking made himself who he was boxing in the basement locked up out of the White House ... wrestling matches boxing\nAnd to his favorite thing with taking people on these hikes in wooded areas of Rock Creek park where he made a rule that you couldn't go around any obstacle you have to go up Iraq if you've got to go down people were falling by the wayside if they're trying to find him in the woods two hours he would exercise every day it's one of the things I think about my leaders which is\nThat they are able to figure out how to find time to think and relax and replenish their energies we think we don't have time in our twenty four seven world they had pretty important things to do this we have a war World War two\nAnd they did they surely did write a door or when you talk about to Roosevelt he took on the monopoly feed their too much power and they did maybe perhaps he would control and too much of the economy and if you want to take on the ah the big guys the bullies maybe it helps when you were a hundred and ten pounds suffers from asthma your whole youth and maybe were picked on yourself\nAnd maybe you don't lose that ability to try to avenge it\nYou know that's really interesting I'm not sure I fully thought about that but I think you're right I mean he was bullied as a child and he felt that some of the big companies were bowling smaller companies and getting them out of business and he was going to defend the people who needed to help the people who were in the independent companies and and wanted to have their own life and their own\nSense of accomplishment and they were being taken by the big handle these monopoly it's I think you're right and thought about\nThat well I Want to talk about the power plays of FDR and LBJ or do we have we have some more time we can go in great so leadership position with a book in turbulent times it's doing extremely
