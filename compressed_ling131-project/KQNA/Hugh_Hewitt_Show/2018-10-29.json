be better if it remains so\nAnd they and that you know they were spread around the country quite widely they never had a huge percentage of the vote and they were important because you know and in fact there isn't anybody quite like that important enough to to make a difference today that I Know of\nBut they were important because politics were very narrowly drawn for Fifteen or Twenty years divided on the slavery question but then ancillary matters\nThat could get four or five or two or three percent of the vote could change things a lot so they were important in American politics\nAnd they were ah they were not a passing phase they'd never really gone away the idea of nativism and the the eye that white Protestant on the country\nBut neither have they ever been very powerful and I do not believe they make up much or even an infant decimal percentage of the Trump coalition\nI don't believe I asked Secretary Clinton this when she was on the show last year do you believe there's

Hillsdale College\nAnd joined by Dr Larry aren't president Hillsdale College of course a great supporter of Israel as I Am and mourning those who died in Pittsburgh uh Larry iron though it never takes long for opportunities to seize on any tragedy\nAnd last night I'm Kevin McCarthy our friend the house GOP leader was attacked by people on the left because he had pleaded out before the Pittsburgh massacre\nThat George Soros Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer we're trying to buy the election which in fact they're trying to do and that's fine that's our constitutional rights but he was accused of anti Semitism for noting that\nI guess because those three men are Jewish and you know Kevin McCarthy I Know Kevin McCarthy our ambassador to Germany Cornell came on earlier he knows Kevin McCarthy what do you make up the charge of anti Semitism with regards to our friend Kevin McCarthy\nWell so both of us know Kevin McCarthy for many decades but what I didn't know and I'll bet Kevin McCarthy didn't know that those guys are all Jews\n[laughter] I'll bet I'll bet you didn't [laughter] and\nAnd you know really 'cause I I think in particular those three guys you know like I I didn't know George ... was a Jew\nBut ... and everybody everybody knows about him right he's this big liberal guy gives all this money right at the truth is if you were going to insult them because they were Jews you would need to be explicit about it 'cause most people wouldn't get the joke\nThat's it and I but of course they don't want you to get that they don't want you to understand Kevin McCarthy they want to smear Kevin McCarthy right and\nThe mayor of anti Semitism is a deep one I mean it it along with being anti black and racism any sort of anti Semitism is the ancient evil it's been denounce specifically but my Catholic churches being mortals and\nUh it's it's unacceptable my children are themselves part Jewish or my ... my wife's great grandfather started the synagogue in Indianapolis I I Can't abide it\nBut it is used as a cudgel does it work where we aren't\nWell uh you know the ... I I Want to say something about the depth of it is they think about the Jews that was ... when you said that walk a ... which I had not heard before that wonderful yeah they get the Jews are unique in history and their unique because the first ancient people\nWhose God did not disappear when the pilots he was defeated\nAnd they kept their God you're they're exiled and this guy on claims to be the one died and the creator of all and then this God claims to have a concern for everybody on earth and the covenant with Abraham\nIs a covenant and this should be a blessing to all the people on the face of the year\nNow you won't find anything like that in the ancient religions have which Judaism is one like three thousand VCR before\nAnd so that's the first thing but the second thing is\nBecause they uh they didn't they didn't disband when their country was overcome the ... the promised land was overcome\nOvercome then what they had been isn't exiled people for a long long time incredibly stubborn and keeping their identity\nAnd so that that places them in lots of other countries and that means the oldest opportunity for resentment of of of strangers in our midst of the Jews\nAnd you know it's just another great fact\nThat about the United states of America that George Washington and Seventeen Ninety eight wrote to the Hebrew congregation in Newport Rhode Island that it is now no more that we speak of religious toleration as it were by the indulgence of some that others enjoyed their inherent natural rights\nAnd that is probably the first letter written by chief executive of any country except ancient Israel\nTo some Jews addressing them as equal citizens that the American heritage and there's no reason to believe that Kevin McCarthy does not does not feel

we knew we were going to be he was\nI mean even very good but isn't Trump point isn't the point toward which he's fighting that what we Americans have in common is our citizenship\nAnd that divides us in the following way we Americans agree that a human being has rights and our country is founded to defend those rights\nAnd to be a citizen of America is the practices and belief\nThat stem from that and it's got nothing to do with color now I think that's what Donald Trump has to say to the world and says it a lot and has been saying that I looked it up before the election back for decades\nAnd so if you say that your enemies are acting bad in the end and you know he says that hard right one of the reasons the political or the political debate is so intense\nIs it now it's a real fight and Trump does fight like with like\nIn the sense that he denounces people really clearly but I don't think in a racist way\nDoes not call for violence wouldn't have holes for his victory that he really wants to win the Senate he really wanted to win Brett Kavanaugh he really wanted the tax cuts he really wants to win like you said you'll get sick of winning\nBut he doesn't call for violence in the information that he does the idea that chance or somehow car chases are hurling insults are like hurling rocks that is of vanity or the left and the media can see that contributes to their narrative\nThat's right and uh [laughter] that's right I mean one of Lincoln great early speeches was you know against mob rule the young man's life see I'm addressing and he just made the point that there'd been some lynchings and they weren't all black people and uh although they were so\nAnd so he he makes the point that if you stream out into the street and act like that and do violence on

Omar who is called Israel evil and where is Chuck Schumer in ... Jewish and CNN and MSNBC all covering that up that's what the ... and they're they have a nerve to accuse the Republicans of being anti Semite when they put a candidate like that that will cause Israel evil or were you were tweet\nIsrael has hit the world they all awake and the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel\nCould you imagine if a Republican and we did that um\nSo how about this can you imagine if a former Republican president was on stage with Farrakhan minister anti Semite anti termite he hates me literally she lives in breeds hate Jewish people\nAnd there was President Clinton sitting there and read the Franklin's funeral day so I mean what are we talking about here this is ridiculous and the thing is inside Washington they may think they're pulling the wool over people's eyes but the rest of the country is laughing at the prospect is the president's to blame at all\nJust like you wouldn't believe President Obama for what happened during his eight years where there are multiple shootings but they were very effective in blaming\nSo that and that is why if maybe maybe an examination of this completely exonerate salmon it's fine he doesn't have her an ongoing financial interests with them but if he does that's a real issue\nI and I think people should know that that that's all I'm saying ah you know if if the Trump Organization through through Eric and John junior continues to business um that has had ties and may have current ties and we're not entirely\nCertain um but all those monuments cases you know the people are bringing as the president and the those have them all listed you can go to\nCruise website you know but that's a that's a concern that they never separated from interests with aren't connected to foreign governments and that foreign governments obviously Brian would be interested in trying to buy influence from the Trump family I mean that that's goal number one\n... who was a big worry about anybody that ever does business who wants to run for the White House when you think\nWell you know what they better you know what cut ties before you take that job that's I'm Sorry those are the two separate those are two\nSeparate even tell you why did cut ties with the Trump Organization still did\nPresident Trump has not severed his ... his ... his connection to the Trump Organization continues to profit from that business he continues to be connected to that he never officially separated from it who's really\nRunning that in a blind trust\nAnd you know what I can tell you that it is serious question first skeptics of what's going on with this coziness with Saudi Arabia that the Trump family whether it's papa or sons continue to have interests\nThat are connected to Saudi Arabia I'm not the only one asking this question I I think that the next time someone wants to run for president after President Trump if they'd been in business\nThey better go bend over backwards to divest and just connect and disengage so that we can rebuild the trust of the American people who for decades before President Trump took office have always believed in you know Brian they come up to you on the street and tell you this and me\nThat it's all about money that no matter which which person which parties running the government somehow there on the cake\nAnd we have to build back this trust and we can't be doing business foreign governments while we're conducting national security\nAlso the I don't know what they are but the house Democrats who said issue fifty two ... that were blocked by the Republicans are theme to the subpoenas or they just all over the place\n[noise] oh no they're all they're all the ... they have everything to do with an air it's everything it's like health care and and all these different policy issues along with ... sort of the ethical\nUm the the you know the group of ethical questions that range as we have to you and I have discussed before throughout the cabinet it's not just President Trump but what people are allowed to do at the cabinet level as well so um as I think you and I talked to in our last conversation they're going to jump on Ryan's again Wilbur Ross\nAh an interior and commerce shore and um but but the the fifty two subpoenas are on oh my God environment you know on a million policy questions along with ethical conduct right\nUm so you have to be a Ryan Zinke he needed to do to live and different investigations into him Wilbur Ross will have explained to do to the Democrats are in the majority not only about a potential insider trading and conflicts of interest protests in Congress that may not have been truthful about those discussions\nRight there is an ongoing um there's a debate about whether or not it when he testified to Congress and was asked about this uh censorship sorry the I'm a citizen question on the census\nWhether or not he was forthcoming and he later said that he then we're called a conversation with Steve Bannon about creating a citizenship test I mean a question on the on the census and not\nUm he basically his spokesman as explaining that he didn't really understand what he was being asked when he was being asked that but that will I just I'm telling you that will be a hearing right immediately because that say you know the census is ... is a huge political issue um along with citizenship and you know\nThe the whole fight over immigration sort of writ large\nThey're not going to go going after Kavanaugh would not be wise more than likely right\nI just think it's I think it's really hard to prove a there were these misconduct complaints that were forwarded from a from a a judge on the on the district a court of appeals [noise]\nThe the story broke an hour before the Senate votes maybe two thirty on that Saturday and the vote was at four o'clock sharp\nUm that he had sent these complaints to ah the chief justice John Roberts the Supreme Court\nThat having nothing to do with Dr Ford but concerns that a he can to his conduct in his compartment in those hearings for not worthy of a justice of the Supreme Court same complaint that retired Justice John Paul Stevens made about cabinet that he's too partisan\nAnd that he uh you know he he was\nUm you know not measured not judicious not impartial um in in his in his testimony that day but also this other complaint was that he may have perjured himself before the committee on his first set of hearings when it will be for Dr Ford ... about his service of the Bush administration perjury is very hard to prove\nAnd if they want to poke around and they really think a good standing for for for that\nUm you know maybe there needs to be a new process when we you know go through confirmation hearings for the next Supreme Court no matter which party is controlling the Senate\nBut I Do believe that trying to take a ... a justice off of the Supreme Court um who obviously is qualified may have done the wrong thing in his confirmation hearings\nAnd will always be sustained by that but to remove him I just think it's incredibly divisive and destructive and I think it's it's it's not the right\nThing to do list and I think it's really handy to live for both sides for Democrats or Republicans read your column\nBecause given idea of if if we were Democrats habit for at least two years what they should be in ... with the more than likely will be eating with they're able to investigate with this type of the ledger will be there any positive work that could be done\nWell see I Do think it's positive if there's some needed oversight on on um on conduct because I think the president is running a swamp boat and we discuss this before I think it's been\nJust unbelievable what's gone on the blurring of the lines the trampling I'm of the rules and I think the oversight of that is very important I I I make the point in the column that I think that ... going into an impeachment drive\n'em before a special counsel tells us that he actually obstruction of justice for you know we did anything um that would merit impeachment I think is just is is it\nThe thing um that would merit impeachment I think it's just is is it an enormous overstep that will cost them the presidency and twenty twenty and just you know further degrade our discourse and and our political situation I Do think that turning up\nI mean it is the job of the legislative branch no matter which party is running it to hold the executive branch accountable it is a separate and co equal branch because we're not a third world dictatorship and president\nWe run this country and you say without overstepping is really helpful\nBut do you think that if they want to get the Senate and get the presidency they gotta show they can not only investigate the legislate and what about infrastructure what about immigration reform would have rather had become by deficit program where in Twenty years were were knocking down instead of building it up and a buddy who\nAre always obviously hopeful about the ways that the party's been worked together and they're not always you know sharing our priorities but\nI Do believe the areas that are potentially um you know ripe for compromise are a prescription drug pricing and I and I think infrastructure and I really hope that they you know they don't have huge budget fights that lead to government shutdowns\nI don't see any kind of agreement on immigration coming because the the Democrats aren't going to get the Senate they're going to get the house by four seats if they get it [noise] um I think if the Republicans hold on it'll be by you know for seven seats to I think it's going to be incredibly I'm slim a week old\nSon and already we called for either party and not can create opportunities for consensus or it can just be a disaster but I think I Hope immigration and some prescription drug work as possible immigration it's just a fight that both part the Democrats are leaning far too heavily on immigrant rights\nAnd President Trump is fleeting far too heavily on the fight he was his his bill in the Senate Brian got fewer votes from Republicans and Democrats combined than any of the proposals he took for positions on the good luck bill in the house he made it clear to ... he didn't want the DACA deal he doesn't want to daily wants to fight for twenty twenty I see no hope on that issue in the next two\nYears yeah I'm going to be I'm going to just give you a scenario you're ready yet he won two years didn't do anything because he feels as though I had the house I have the Senate if given a look weak whatever he did whatever calculus he thought he didn't go for it but if you lose the house\nAnd see you get that offer that deal again from democratic leadership of hey I'll give you the wall or you get ten year a ten year a path on DACA\nMaybe takes it and he goes guys this is what I got you know this is the best I got I don't have the house I'm going to do a deal here\nBecause I knew that I Will give him credit if he does that right no I Know absolutely well do you see people\nTo break down and and and solve some of our problems I Know when they're not going to do ... ... they're not going to tackle everything but I I Would I Would be so happy for even a half a loaf on immigration just something\nI can give him credit if he does that absolutely\nThink Lindsey Graham really wants them to do it and right now he has a they say well when we was going to alienate the Freedom Caucus well what if he doesn't have the house",
