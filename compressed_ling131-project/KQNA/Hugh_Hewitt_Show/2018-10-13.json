speak with your groove at your group to your group with your group sure\nWhat's going on in the world in my world of politics and the electoral college taxation veterans\nAnd at the same time if you want to hear me cover a topic with my opinion here on the show\nAlex at cab dot bet that's A. L. E. X. at sea a bead on that you want to try another email you can go to Alex ... dot com it's M. E. L. U. S. K. E. Y. dot com\nBut it's ... that Alex a cab done better Alex ... dot com\nI welcome your questions\nKeep it simple [laughter] you usually do I have some good ones I really do I have people that ask me questions in they don't know me necessarily but I I think it's very nice of you you ... the compliments I get their lives I tried all up and go to my had too much\nBut I Do appreciate listeners I Do appreciate you getting me to talk about things that interest you so I Do try to cover some Arizona stuff up 'cause\nI live in Arizona that's where I make my own home that's where I Love to be but I tried to cover national news speaking of national news or international news\nBeing a national news or international news something that [laughter] kind of shocked me this week was wouldn't Nikki Haley indicated she was going to step down as the ambassador to the un for United States\nShocking because I just seen her last week her speak about our president and the un\nAnd amazingly enough shoes with a group and they were very supportive of her as in my ... been very impressed with her as\nA representative to the UN ambassador uh she's been very strong there\nShe said that a lot of the sessions used to be just Israel bashing sessions now they're not now because of her questioning because her standing up for Israel it's not quite the same thing anymore I'm hoping whoever is appointed by our president as the ambassador to the UN is able to stand firm\nRepresenting the United states of America in our best interests first\nBut also\nSeeking to correct those who would be so cruel to others and\nCause a threat to our nation I'm honestly surprised at the un even exists as it is with us supporting it so much financially I said before I think the best solution would be to take the property back for Manhattan put them all on a barge and\nSend the un off to into the harbor out to sea [laughter] sometimes I just don't know what his uses but I got it I get it for open discussion for discussion for a place for the world to be able to ... go and send their representatives to\nShare ideas grievances solutions I get it but when it doesn't work it doesn't make sense to me when other countries don't have our ideology where they don't consider that that people should come first when you're talking about [noise]\nAll a guard he's are places where other people don't have the right to self govern that's when it becomes a bit of an issue for me\n[noise] speaking of it becoming an issue for me we\nDo have a right here in this nation to defend ourselves down when\nWe have a Second Amendment right we have a right not to be checked right as Eric Holder would also say that we should fight back tell you what holder here pretty big guy you come up to me and you try to kick me see what happens buddy\nYeah ain't going to end well it's also not something that fits well with me when a protester gets kicked a\nProtester that is non violent that is one of the ugliest things you could imagine\n\nAnd I think it's a good to talk about it since there are some pro life protesters a pro life pro says the video it's going viral out there\nA pro life protester attacked because they are pro life\nBecause they believe\nThat the right to life is paramount they believe that without the right to life maybe all of our other rights do cease to exist\nSo\nI Would love to hear back from everybody who go sees the gods now movie that's coming out dean Cain dean Cain from a\nPrinceton University yeah\nNo I'd love to hear feedback from you folks I Want everybody's opinion on that I'm planning on getting a ticket and going out and seeing it this weekend or next or I'm going to price you to the theaters now because we get a good showing in the theaters it'll continue\nI like to hear both sides folks I really do I like to hear the argument for somebody that believes that\nWe should still have abortion I don't believe that I've shared my story is on the on the show before\nIt's not about a woman it's about life it's about the life of the individual it's about the right to life\n\nI've talked about it on the show quite a bit but right now I just want to encourage all of you to go to the gods no movie check it out\nI'm just I'm amazing the story\nI I've also heard during the filming of this movie there was a lot of problems where they had to relocate and change locations because people are canceling autumn but guess what I found out last week when speaking with some people\nJust the opposite also happen there were some places that opened their arms to the film crew of God's now and we're helping them assisting them in any way shape or form possible\n\nSo check out the movie let me know what you think about it and tell you what folks\n\nAre\n... don't go low don't go low don't get violent you're just going to piss people off when you get violent when you're trying to protest somewhere\nIf your friend of mine you're not going to be a violent protester absolutely defend yourself you have that right use your voice uses a pen do in a way that's not annoying either well annoy the heck out of people in your writing but don't scream like a ban she likes some people do\n\nThe greatest protestor in my lifetime activists speaker was the ever ever nonviolent protest or Dr Martin Luther king\nA wow\nThat would be amazing but on top of that we all remember jokes case before the courts where before he was actually um before the actual tape came to a close he was part and before the verdict had been laid out\nThe U.S marshal is responsible for protecting the judges in the district courts in the courts so he will be charged with protecting the same judge that ruled on his case interesting huh\nI just want to bring that up sawed I'd bring it up anyway I might be having a guess and the next few minutes going to come on and talk to us a ballot\nPolls about the elections I'm\nOver here I can find a friend in sponsor who might be able to come on and share his wisdom otherwise I'm going to share what I heard from him [laughter] okay I'm going to\nDo it I'm going to do it we're going to talk pools we're gonna talk numbers um there are a lot of races we\nNeed

I don't know about your state how many early voters you get that in the last cycle Seventy five percent of the folks were male and early ballot voters\nYes Seventy five percent that's frightening to me\nI Do fill out my early ballot form but guess what\nI typically don't do it 'til the day I go in why because\nI Want to make sure I understand everything that's going on I also want to see something comes up I also want to see if something happens to my candidate that I don't like what I'm hearing and I encourage you [laughter]\nBased upon Alan Cohen at our Second Amendment that you especially hold off when we're talking about our US Senate race here in Arizona and just about well many other tight races in our nation\nCan't say more than that I Wish I had the information to share with you today but there might be something breaking very soon so hold on to your ballots and guess what folks you know sometimes\nDuring the election day the lines are really long and you don't like standing in line waiting to\nDrop off your ballot guess what you can drop off a sealed filled out ballot sign ballot\nWithout waiting in line you just go in and you drop it off into the proper place\nYes that's it\nSo before you head out you can go and you want to have to wait in line isn't that great Mm yeah it is I really do like to wait\nAnd speaking of waiting\nI Know some people that are Trump supporters\nWith Martha McSally for what reason I Do not know\nI get it I get it because during the primaries she might not have stood out and said she was supporting Donald\nJ Trump for president in the United states uh\nDuring the primary do you remember me\nShining it to the rooftops no my wife was but here some people like to vet candidate\nSome people also have friends that are running for office okay\nI was vetting candidates I was trying to figure out where some of the other people that I admire that might get to know candidates better might sit or say\nAre you trying to tell me I was supposed to\nCompletely discard good people like Mike Huckabee like Rick Santorum like Ben Carson like Ted Cruz like Rand Paul to aside automatically and there are plenty others we had a very talented group of men and women running for office on each and all and they are different ways\nI mean they all added something they all had something that was that was valuable and you know what I Am thrilled that\nAnd you know what I Am thrilled that our president one\nShe has been phenomenal and yeah I did vote for him in the primary All right there you have it I don't know whom\nExcel even before but I Do know one thing she's voted for Ninety eight percent of the time while he's been on an office in ... and how much sixty two percent of the time yes yes now we all know during the election cycle that Bush and Romney of\nYou're paying attention in Arizona are coming to Arizona they're having events are having meet and greets those are some pretty big hitters folks for president United States\nAnd the former GOP nominee\nThey're going to be an Arizona to help Martha McSally alley\nNow I've gotten this information from my good friends of western journalism\nGreat source for information Google them as you go there or if you're a Facebook\nFan of mind Facebook forward slash Alix Malesky\nYou'll notice that they're one of the sources that I use for a lot of my stories they\nUse them and they use the Washington Times quite a bit daily single and others but she's in a tight race the numbers keep coming out\nDifferently or showed that uh that cinema had a slight lead one point eight percent but\nJust this past Tuesday ABC had a poll with her at a forty seven to forty one percent advantage at six points CBS is pool says it\nCinemas at forty seven forty four\nListen these polls change every day goes up a little down a little bit uh really depends on what's going on in a new state in the world what's newsworthy I Will tell you some positive positive positive going for Mick Sally\nOne\nPeople are still upset about the Kavanaugh hearings we are not saying here on this station here on my show that Dr Ford was not abuse she was more than likely abused by somebody I just don't think it was cabinet\nAnd even if it was she does not have the proof\nAnd the burden of proof is upon the prosecutor's not on the defendant and I'll tell you who is at fault absolutely\nAnd that's people like Dianne Feinstein\nWho know better than this\nTo drag this poor woman out in front of these people and set her up like that\nThat's despicable to drag having offer\nThis and his family's vast despicable\nAbsolutely despicable\nAnyway\nWith Sally and the latest polls looks to be ad that bodes well for all the other Republicans it's often top down around here folks right we don't have a presidential election we have a mid term\nNow as I said for those of you that might have voted for ward might have voted for pie dough listen", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "year":
