you in a [noise]\n\nWelcome back to a town hall review I'm Hugh Hewitt your partnership when I graduate school of public policy\nMarkers show wasn't Saudi ... have been journalist until two weeks ago that's when he disappearing or Saudi council within ... who was murdered we're reports it was a brutal murder of Turkish government first point an accusatory finger in Saudi ruler\nAlternative explanation is rogue operative took it upon themselves to carry out the murder of ...\nI mean we can world still lack a plausible answer turned the middle east expert David ...\nNew York times and the personal acquaintance of ...\nWhat was your relationship with your market show he\nWell he was a source you know he was somebody I was friendly with them as I said we would have lunch together and chit chat you know and not someone I Would have over to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew he was it was hard not to like what do you see happening David\nWell movies for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nUh the jerky boys likely to accept that explanation as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledge that Jamal show he had been killed inside the confidence in his devil and that seems like the way things are headed at this hour a well informed\nSource or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia at identify the person they're going to say is responsible he put him on his way into the person that is responsible someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and so like ... percent intelligence\nAt the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that doesn't seem terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nAnd this is the Henry the second defense from when the English King\nSaid ... well no one had me on this troublesome praised him for his lights go out and shot or Thomas Beck and can America the drill it works and you know the twelve hundred minutes ... century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think\nWell what is it works I mean you know of course well I'm In the government to make do with a partial troops fairly often uh the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point uh after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish officials and all those been confirmed it's going to be\nDish of officials and all this been confirmed it's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to repair his ... his reputation\nYou know he gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up became them kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and mark 'cause I could work but he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover rendition gone bad import cage NBS in ordering the rendition knows that important do you do you think the royal court changes in succession\nAre just two elements there first of all I think this person this intelligence official who's going to take the blame if that person is try that Bush will be tried in a Saudi cord\nSo that's not the kind of court or used to wear the defendant might have an opportunity to blame the crown prince uh you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nSpeaking with a tree guy mentioned his recent book into the hands of soldiers in the middle east correspondent for the New York times as soon as you well qualified to unravel the mysterious geopolitics of the region or conversation continues\nSaturday I mean his changed crown prince ... consolidated power like male figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key levers and so the best handicapping is there is no one in a position to challenge him a while there are many people in the ... who are enjoying criticizing him over this he's made many enemies along the way\nNone of them seems to have enough half to push him out a lot of succession as long as a dad okay with it and his dad is elderly and may not be that cabinet right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king ah not too long ago did you expect to meet with ambience when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that there is within the guy and this was just a range of ... have you been to every second option which is your responsibility but not a guilt\nThe other one as you say someone was trying to take me out rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals an eye on improving the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know and to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that is what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear it so the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend\nOf a crowd Brits around with someone who felt like he had the okay it from the crown prince to do this rendition and who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nWill that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would or the second defense six a sufficient to the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared it's intelligent\nTurkish officials have leaked many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of moved from inside the conflict showing who did what Amy ... you know they've got they've got the goods if they've shared that\nWish there U.S intelligence ... who often work very closely with the Turks\nAnd then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nAll right now doesn't impact for example the war in Yemen this is actually where I come home which was the anti Iran alliance spinning stretches in\nJordan and Egypt in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel in America trying to confront the who you are sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran does this break that anti Iranian alliance which many about ... and welcome a as being a necessary course correction in the middle east\nOr I'm not sure they have any impact on the Iranian odds I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish tennis whatsoever about what's been done here\nAnd so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept this explanation he was even yesterday you know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting that this was a robot operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation\nThemselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts it moves on because it as an exotic story and read like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long David Kirkpatrick\nYeah I think we're trying to say before where it's going to hit the crown prince is with elite opinion you know the wall street and Silicon Valley or she's enjoy the company of those people he's worked hard to get them to invest in Saudi Arabia to bring their businesses and their insights and there are no out to help diversify the Saudi economy\nHe's going to find it very hard to be a front man for that sort of effort and that's not trivial because Saudi Arabia over the not too long term has got some real issues in terms of being able to support their economy on their oil revenue\nListen to the entire interview with New York times reporter Tim Mak drink on channel

economic dynamism has birth the constitutional order regulatory system we finally got it\nAnd I think you're going out there and I have to read this now in every class and they're going to love
