program now Stephanie of course the MSNBC Live anchor coming up at the top of the hour Seventy good morning morning to you thank you for joining us okay so the story of the day seems to have more from the caravan at least for the time being anyway to what it means\nTo be a nationalist the president of course declared it is used to rally\nThere he is not a global is the the nationalist and he was instantly seized upon as being a white Knight well asked anyway by Jim Acosta don't you mean white nationalist\nIs it possible to just be a nationalist meaning I care about Americans before I care about the concerns of the globe\nHere's the thing this is just an necessary or a great way to articulate that you're a patriot a patriot somewhere defends our nation or devalue our nation above all others in a perfect world could say\nWell that could mean a nationalist too well in a perfect world you could but we both know and we've heard from the likes of extraordinary leaders like John McCain\nThat's not a word we need to use it as a dog whistle at a time where we are seeing racism and seen a phobia on the rise let's simply be better and not use that word\nWhy why why why if if it is anonymous whip patriot which I agree patriotism nationalism\nAs I said in a perfect but we're not living in a perfect\nWell why don't we strive for world instead of playing to the fears and the and again the racist the allegations of of people for political partisanship why don't we make our property\nWorld because it's not like we're saying it's not like we're hearing from someone that has a high adding gets word who strives for ... for a perfect world it's just a president who took him time after time and time again as he avoided a speech saying that he didn't know David give\nThe president has already said in the last week up there are good people from the middle east on that caravan and you and I both know he's been dog whistling straight out of the gate since he came down the elevator at Trump Tower wait\nWait on wait a minute wait a minute this this was this the president said after he pulled out of the Paris climate accord I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of terrorists is that a dog whistle or an acknowledgement that my first duty and obligation is to the people of our country that is one of the dog will say well that is a state of loyalty to the people who are elected him\nThat's not a dog whistle so I'm not saying\n... not saying anything is I'm a nationalist oh about an hour people before the people of Paris are the people around the globe\nI'm not saying that what he said specifically about the Paris climate accord was a dog whistle but many many other things including many sides speaking about Charlottesville word dog whistle\nBut the president's Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism not comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second\nA nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nThen we're going to agree to disagree\nGiven the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer if he was extra careful in his word choices especially as we go internal election where he is capitalizing on your mark right so we're going to agree to that where we\nStarted well yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not caused it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many things that President has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes me feel so uncomfortable his you know your your expertise is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while your former anyway\nYou know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or a nationalism in globalism in were you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're gonna stop other countries in taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better game for our market\nIs that that is not not to nominate nationalism but is that not economic nationalism is my question\nNot if you look at the way the president is conducting themselves to give you the truth it's had an impact he would engage and things like the PC to point out and partner with our allies that have been kept\nSaying Seventy rule thank you for coming on we appreciate or she is on MSNBC Live at the top of the hour\n[noise]\nMiddle non stop actually\nFor me and she was\nFive is this your your for policy genius dot com that life insurance since I was a young man since I got married

of a second migrant caravan at the Honduran border behind the larger one in more than seven thousand from Central America making its way toward the U.S for the Texas lieutenant governor says the Trump Administration is preparing with\nSome in light of the military and we're going to have I Believe a larger and expanded detention centers can Patrick\nOn Fox News at night meanwhile new figures on immigration\nAnd border protection releasing their fiscal year twenty Eighteen apprehensions for the southwest border total apprehensions more than three hundred and Ninety six thousand that job thirty percent from last year in family units are the ones that really made history a record number a hundred and seven thousand times\n... and they're still weeks away from ... thousand miles them not to go to our border it could be twenty it could be twenty five by then so here's what I Want to know from a law enforcement perspective share\nWhat do you and other law enforcement officers going to do when these people get here because they are coming in\nCongress where you're writing Congress will not do anything they're busy campaigning back in their districts they're not even at work or in the capital now\nSo they're not going to change anything which means when thousands and thousands of people come to our border and start claiming asylum as you well know we cannot they're paying them we don't have the facilities to detain them at the border\nPlus it's been decided that that's inhumane ah and we can't turn them away so they're going to be released with a promise that they'll come back ah ah ... we know that eighty Ninety percent of them don't so this this crowd I I'm sadly just accepting the fact\nOf now fourteen thousand which could be more is coming\nAnd they're going to come to Massachusetts they're going to come to where I sit in Ohio there going to come all over this country and spread themselves out never to be seen again until of course ah sometimes it's too late then we see them for the wrong reasons\nWell yeah and and the thing that that is important to point out too is that and and I'll just at that point just a second but it's also important to know that you've ... you've county right now Colorado we releasing a hundred two hundred and fifty family units per day back into the community to taking the bus bus stops\nThe greyhound bus terminals and putting them on buses and not because ice wants to but but by law they can only hold them for twenty days once that happens they have to give them their court paper when they have to return\nThe court dates for example in Massachusetts for some of the arrested today on immigration charge and he's told to come back to court the court they start coming up to twenty twenty four where do you think they're going to be twenty twenty four\nAnd how we're going to find them that's one that you know I've talked to one person I think about the thousands that are coming in never mind the fourteen thousand right now that are supposed to be coming across\nA trying to come into our country so yeah we have to do some of this is why this is this is an urgent situation and this is why I Can't believe Congress\nSits on their hands and it's more interested in politics than they are and taking care of the the public safety of the people in our communities\nAnd our national security I mean this is this is as bad as it gets in for Congress to\nTo not see this is a fundamental responsibility they have is to protect the citizens of our nation that's what governments fundamental responsibility is so I've been talking to the sheriff's Bob across the country and we're talking on the phone with western shirts\nAnd talking about what are we what can we do I mean we're we've as you know we started that crowd funding page for the for the wall dot com I think we're over a hundred and thirty thousand right now we're getting ready\nWe're working on a presentation to\nAh to um [noise] I ... I mean to a da chess a ... the first installment and then and then we hope that at that point when that happens we'll see the activity pick up across the country I actually had a guy like staff came in before I went to Washington last week and\nSaid look you've got to read this letter and it was from a gentleman in Ontario, Oregon I opened it up\nThere was a five dollar bill five one dollar bills with a note attached to it said please build a wall between the United states and Mexico\nAnd I see Iraq's the envelope and the five bills and the five dollar bill and I sent it to all these sheriff's around the country that went with us to Washington from the thirty five states said listen\nThis gentleman represents the best of America and he's maybe of modest means but he believes in some way that he can help you know joined with the sheriff's across this nation\nAnd fight to get this wall built which we've been asking for for Twenty years and um protect our neighborhoods because he sees as most Americans do our communities are getting worse and worse when it comes to the victimization by criminal illegal aliens\nAnd um and I said you know this not only does he represent the best of America\nThat this represents why we a sheriff's now I have to take over for what Congress has refused to do were elected by the exact same people that Congress are\nBut it's it's our time in history now to step up stand with our people and let's get this border security let's you know fulfill our obligation and our promise to the people are in spite of what Congress is doing work against us\nWhile it is extraordinarily important in I'm so glad to see people like you taking a leadership position because again we you know we we're gonna have to accept this I think the president's intentions are the best\nAbsolutely I think he you know his promise to put military at the border is is a great thing although it's nothing but show because they're not going to fire on people they're not going to physically you you know a stop people with thanks and ... they're going to just be there for show as a backdrop\nBut at the end of the day if they come up and use the right coded language the code words that they've been coach didn't say when they get their smarts claiming asylum they're going to get a they're going to be given a you know a summons to come back and have that concern but it's going to take many months and as we know they're going to be here they're going to be\nWell I don't know if he saw Bob I'm looking to solve this but it's important again for people to really understand what's going on and who's behind this we believe I'm obviously there are people in this country who are encouraging it or right before the midterms that have some of that is part but if you look at the two thousand five they were ... they were showing it today to two thousand five\nTape on Obama he said we cannot allow people just to come into this country uh and and violate our laws\nAnd and the only way out the president retweeted that yesterday and said I agree with President Obama one hundred percent where are the Democrats now a share of Hodgson thank you for their time

I don't understand why they why they did the political calculus and think that's something to back off off\nYou know President Trump has been right all along and he's been here we're trying to put up an immigrant\nBeen right all off and he's been fair with trying to put up an immigration plan that would be fair to all secure our borders have an immigration system it actually works and would not be in this problem that we are today in the future what changed here is the Democrats just want to be\nNumber one of them voted for that tax bill not in the house and Senate and now we're the most competitive country in the world we haven't been here more than a decade you had to go past\nAnytime of the Obama because he could never get us to this point\nBut they didn't want to resist everything we do so even though that President Trump went even further about DACA than others have gone in the path to try to bring everybody together when we put those two immigration bills on the floor and it takes two hundred and Eighteen votes to pass one\nWell there's two hundred and twenty three Republicans who voted for one or the other just not one not one Democrat would vote for those bills\nAnd that you would not have the caravan you'd have a secure border but you'd have an immigration system that actually work\nYou might remember this but evidently Dianne Feinstein of two thousand eight passed in two thousand nine there really told the Mexicans are you are the problem and sent a message to Central Americans in South Americans will favor you\nThat is why we're having these charges at the border what was that bill what is the effect when and how do you think we can now do we can undo it\nWell this is a problem we have what it's called ... other than Mexican so if somebody from Mexico comes across the border illegally we catch them we send them back\nBut if there are other than from Mexico\nThey get a catch and release in our country that's why that care of and just keeps going\nAnd it's I think the one moment isn't that a group of people fit inside your own country was American but decided I just want to live in your house we are a rule of land land they believe in the ... law he will break society down if you break the rule of law\nAnd they're just going to come up here and then they're just going to scurry and try to come across the border and all different places\nThat's why the president has a right of why we need the wall and that's why I have to build build the wall enforce the law and the other elements of just building that wall\nSanctuary cities in that because\nThat's an incentive to come the ability to remove gang members tapes law what we found numerous times that people have been deported three four times it's still coming back around but also supports the ice and it can dams any idea of allowing the illegals to vote I think that's a common sense bill that we can do to impact\nNo doubt how hard the president's been working in you've been working to try to save the house would you realistic you said there there's too many retirements to be optimistic even though you're not giving up and you also say there's a lot of rich people throwing money around especially former New York mayor\nMichael Bloomberg I Know he's been giving 'em like I did not know to what extent would it be done\nMichael Bloomberg if you if you watch just about a week and a half ago he re registered Democrat and he puts you cut it out on the press he is now given a hundred million dollars eighty million to the Democrats in the house and twenty million to human that he's trying to\nBuy the nomination because he wants to run against Donald Trump you kind of by Congress but it's not just him come dire\nMore than a hundred and twenty million\nAnd remember their whole goal is to impeach the president he brags that his impeachment list is bigger than a list of the n._r._a. and then we know what sort of that so three men alone\nHas an unbelievable amount of millions of dollars trying to win the house and that's what's creating some of the difficulties look I'm On the road tried to help conservatives everywhere we can't yesterday I was with ... in Florida that I was with Brian Bass remember remember who Brian masses congressmen today\nServed on military served in Afghanistan\nAnd you lose both his legs\nLost both his life but you know when the biggest challenges in Florida is this algae he's been the leader on that\nHe's the one that that got it didn't lead to fight this today I'll be up in Jacksonville for Michael Waltz he could become the first green ... to ... to Congress this is Ron defenses his old seats were in a fight there\nI mean I'll be in the Atlanta handle remember she won the special election for Tom Price to see Michael Bloomberg just put two million dollars into her race against her she's one of the most effective members we have been ... and then\nAt lunch I'm going to be with Maria Elvira Salazar this is a Florida is twenty seven she's running against Donna Shalala remember Donna Shalala in the Clinton Administration who also ran the Clinton Foundation destroyed or the college down here as well\nWe're up in that race because ... she's been a part of this community when she was in the news with Telemundo Univision another she's been a part of this community here it's just a fundamental difference we have great candidates resources are against it\nBut at the end of the day I Believe we keep the house\nAnd then of course you would run for speaker\n[laughter] well my number one goal is make sure we have a Republican who could be speaker that's the battle between now and November six we can decide what happens after\nTwenty seconds what happened you a Boulder went through the window and one of your headquarters\nWell it's my congressional\nOffices are older I don't know that one person could lift that say they remember who the glass ran in there and stole things and then ran out gotten the car and depart who knows why they did it what motivated to do it or if somebody wanted them to\nDo with the video on his Facebook page of you know these people help 'em out Republican or Democrat this has gotta stop majority leader Kevin McCarthy can't thank you thank you ride it all the hard work you're doing you got it uh coming back to your next one eight six six eight seven six six million\nBrown I Am a Democrat I Love your show I Love Trump but\nThis year has been really hard for me I had to swallow a lot you know it started with Maria thrown paper tells a lot of people um and then you know like you know disaster is saying you know don't monkey that so now yesterday ... president comes out and said he's a nationalist as\nIf we don't know what that means you guys are pushing us away let flu this weekend where history shows that we're moving\nTo tell me if tell me if this level and let me tell me a for example there are things that you could say to me that might insult me as an Irish Italian New Yorker you might not know it but there are things that I can say to you or they might insult you depending on your nationality race or religion and I might not know it\nSo Donald Trump saw that there were some problems with them using the word nationalist and expanded on it here cut thirty seven\nAll I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours so called allies they had not treated our country fairly so in that sense I Am absolutely a national is that I'm proud of it\nDo you understand that the president is a lot of things but he's not a dog whistle guy there's nothing subtle about it which is why I Know we didn't have a metal the Russian didn't work with the Russians to win an election does that further explained it to you\nBrian I'm definitely I totally get what he's trying to say why not come out of say I'm a ... this is my country where the best country first national is what was going to happen with these guys before they talk nobody\nWho say country first America First that's why I voted for him but when you come out and you say something like that Brian I may not take it like that but my people are not stupid and we know that that was the word Nazis years so why use it\nUm\nYou know the definition of a person who advocates Political Independence for a country a person who's drunk patriotic feelings especially one who believes in superiority of their country over others that's how Donald Trump is using the word here they care about the history he knows what he's using it for now\nThe media's twisting it though this is what I'm trying to save I understand I think Donald Trump races I really don't you understand that but my people the people that I Want to come out and go to get us to cross the finish line are you guys are pushing them away\n[noise] yeah I Do so you guys I Know about it and don't think the president has a consultant on that he doesn't I\nDon't think that he bounce it off Kellyanne Conway or bill shine he didn't never does you don't you know he doesn't they don't deserve credit for the big says he's had a and maybe on the platform and they don't take credit or discredit for some of those sayings\nHe's challenging again he's like I don't care about the path and tell you how I mean it but I hear you Jerry you know that's a good point ah both for the most part they got to listen to them and you say these are what does he mean by that and also even if if he is nothing else he knows how to when\nThere's no way that the president's successful nor his party is winning if they just have one sect they need a lot of\nHispanics blacks women and men\nWhen we come back we're going to be joined by a guy whose campaign was struggling he seems to be going to get on track Ron dissent against the Andrew Gillum it's got the whole world watching will run to Santa will define what makes him different when we
