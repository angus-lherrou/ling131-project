even the trade group with standing behind him awkwardly for an hour well he took questions Tucker girls [noise]\nTucker you're you're very interesting because as much as you're into the traditional\nWashington speak to wait until it was done you wide open to doing something to do with taking in Trump and noticing rather than judging notice he's doing things different but saying not necessarily doing things wrong that's different than a lot of a lot of Republicans in a lot of Democrats why you open to that\nBecause it's needed because the decision that the people in charge you may have been disastrous not just small decisions for big decisions on the economy and foreign policy on the culture they haven't worked that's why the middle class is dying that's what Trump got elected\nThat's the best part of the doubt that if Trump is he doesn't know how to get things done because he doesn't understand government doesn't care about details but the best part\nIs his willingness to say obviously through things like maybe we should secure the borders or what are we still doing in Afghanistan or why are the other signatories tort trade deals not living up to their end of the bark and et cetera those are all totally true things that everybody agrees with except in Washington or the people who made the decisions are embarrassed to admit they're wrong\nTrump takes a lotta crap for not apologizing that's a fair criticism but how about the policymakers who got us into all this garbage in the first place where they apologize I never want to they learn from their mistakes nothing\nI mean do you know what I'm saying like the back part about Trump is telling obvious truth is\nI always knew you as an opinion guy did Daily Caller is part of that you know to you decide to launch that\nUh and it's doing should credibly well it's on everyone's punch list in the morning three o'clock in the morning for me later for you to find out what's happening new and get a perspective\nBut the other thing is you choose to do something almost nobody else does you choose to book and engage people that disagree with you I'm usually open how did you come to that a without a no brainer for you is that a producer they told you that that you want to have to defend your argument in your a block almost every night\n[noise] no I mean that's organic that's what I Believe it I mean I'm very liberal in the true sense of liberal I Believe in free speech and the free exchange of ideas I Believe in openness I really do\nI don't I'm exactly the same on the air's I'm off the air I only say what I really think you may think I'm a total buffoon maybe you're right but it sincerely who I Am and I think that you should if you're advocating for something explain what it is you're advocating for\nExplaining reasoning what exactly are you saying these are not hard things you seek to influence public policy in the way three hundred million people live their lives you should have to explain it I I sincerely believe in that it's a core belief\nBut you also research you're not just winging it ain't going on instinct you are to defend your argument but you research and go to be you can go deep on your argument you can go layers deep you're not going to get out a out yell somebody\nWell yeah but I mean the the good news for me is I control what the terms are so\nI decided what we talk about and I don't know I don't know much about the law the sea treaty or abstract art so we don't do a lotta segments on those things which is a shame to shame actually I'm I'm against both just for the record but we do topics that I care about that I think are really important immigration is one of them and I don't know what I'm paid to do is to learn about stuff so I Do write\nYou you're the one who gets paid I did not know who that was so we did bring up here\nOn the topic was the name of the book and we're going to talk about this uh on a ... as long as the book is out and you want to come back but you look at the Democratic party and under a minute and you said this thing has changed I guess this is a different debate we're having I asked you sent TV Patel wait till the radio audience the bottom\nLine is it's a mirror image of what it was when I grew up and the things that they once defended free speech due process colorblindness they now attack why 'cause now they're in power\nAnd so the people in power always against free speech inconvenient for them it's always easier to divide the population into tribes in order to rule them than it is to try to rule over United country I mean that liberal took power and so they became the opposite of what they were and that's\nThe best found on college campuses exactly exactly\nSadly yes fried or Tucker Carlson often said about the new it's always great congratulations on the runaway success of your show and good luck with the book ship a fool's how selfish ruling class of bringing America to the brink of revolution soccer go get them back you Brian\nOr in the ... and in the in the legal system in the law in the community have his reputation so couple of things\nWhen it comes down to the actual vote itself\nIt's got to come down to Murkowski Collins and flick so Senator Jeff flake asked say I'm going to vote that's out of committee but I'm going to give it seven days it by friday I Want to investigation and then we'll move forward or not depending on what they find try to read between the lines I sense he's hedging cuts seven\nI don't know good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out how we ... we may not be able to find out everything we've got to do for someone to\nKnow what does that mean now to the president's credit according the Washington Post and he said it publicly I said to these I told the FBI expand it if you have to you know whenever you have to follow which you have to follow\nNow the graduate person who comes out and sat down with Kate Snow of NBC her story is almost farcical it's a bad fiction novel\nI challenge you to listen to her speak and not have all the all the fire alarms in your head go off and say not telling the truth not telling the truth not telling the truth\nSadly if she was the victim of of uh which he claims is\nA group set on unwanted group sex\nThat is terrible but she cannot link Kavanaugh's to the scene that he had a red caught that he would hand to women that the punch would spiked out of high school party\nThat he was around the punch bowl is that going to be okay with you can your life with sand these types of wild cat allegations\nSo Lindsey Graham looked at this is seeing how this has developed obviously he knows Kavanaugh for Twenty years fan of 'em on every level and says this cut Thirteen\nI don't think we're going to find anything new from the supplemental FBI investigation\nTo take Jeff from a yes or no I think [laughter] ... Collins who want to make sure that the FBI their homework to check the committee's work that that wouldn't you know that that our war was good I think that's what they're hearing all about no more not expanding it to all this crazy stuff\nYou know listen ... Lindsey Graham has got to do something that they used to do that you would expect which college did when I think he would just sit down with her and say listen you're Republican forget about this guy did sexual assault thing does not stand up it wouldn't stand up to a relative in your house or a good friend of yours you would not accept it\nSo you saw his record you see President Bush making calls and constantly surprised backing them thoroughly pride Blakeman who work with them every single day you see the people that know him\nDon't get caught up and pay back for not ceding talking to Merrick Garland that is what the foundation of this\nAnd a lot of these people are liberals and see a change in the court and the change in the country if he ceded and willing to say yeah I saw him drunk maybe he was having a few beers in the hallway doesn't mean he did anything wrong\nAnd Deborah Ramirez says I have I've some people that are cooperate by story will see because if you want to corroborate your story maybe you should have told the New Yorker because it didn't come up in the New Yorker magazine story a jealousy our news Ninety six five in her window Hey Joe\nHey yeah obviously the Democrats ... but I didn't want to point out that when you're accused of a criminal act you should take the fifth\nAnd I think the judge was really stupid to\nGive any testimony regarding this\nReally I don't think he had a choice\nWhat he wanted to let alone ... but he would've services occurring mental accusation or take the food\nI don't get ... what's the what's the point of view there you are in other words but if you are innocent till proven guilty and you're innocent why wouldn't you use it opportunity to show your innocent\nTo the point of the Fifth Amendment is to put it on the prosecution and say you prove it I'm not even talking about it\nBut you know we're not in a criminal proceeding\nUp sorry we're not in a criminal proceeding he's in he's testifying on his background where there was one of his three hundred nine cases or is a ten year was eight years with President Bush or his use on the on the circuit court\nListening as water again and now it's personal behavior these are just questions it's beyond a job interview which was supposed to be I get that but you can't say it's a criminal behavior I mean criminal proceeding\nThanks so much for the call a new way of taking the fifth I I don't understand from that\nUm [noise] so ... there's there's a lot going on here the person that makes the most sense who isn't just the right wing is LA and a right wing or defense counsel is Lindsey Graham\nHe is a really good idea he's if they want to mix the entire thing if they want to just say oh we're not going to pass him if these Republicans won't get on board we know this is cool by Jeff Flake he is out so he will not be a problem in the new uh with the new term\nWe know it's probably going to be Senator Rick Scott so that won't be a problem he will probably be chairman is Senator Lindsey Graham of the uh of the judicial branch of the judicial committee a justice committee so it looks like ground who's going to step aside\nAnd he basically says why don't we put it to the American people again\nLet's decide who could control the Senate cut Fifteen\nWould be an appeal from a political body to the people who put in the air\nAnd sea at these Trump state that elected President Trump and doing exactly what he's doing I'm cutting taxes and appointing conservative judges they're okay with the decision there Center for I don't think we're trying to get there I think we're going to get the plot but if we found one vote short for the good of the nation\nI Would appeal to the people of the country and let them have effect\nAt the ballot box Joe listening in Boston Joe [noise]\nHey Ryan it's just it seems so profoundly juveniles that they're going back to high school and seeing how many beers yes yup and also the same time really hypocritical when an electric ministry and you've had a president that admitted to cocaine use and his own books\nIn that it at that age\nYeah exactly exactly so apparently you can't be a Supreme Court justice but you're going to be the guy that ...\nThat is a great point which I'm not ... brought up before now some of the media to say that he knows\nBefore now some of the media to say that he no longer has the credibility of the accuser it's about Kavanaugh approving his credibility which I think it's scary\nThe White House does say they will expand the investigation but they're not going to look into how much he drank in college to look at incidents and it's not clear if he's going to talk to Cedric or not\nBut they are talking obviously Deborah Ramirez already there talking to mark judge right now they're going to talk to Patrick Smith they could have done that already I imagine they're always going to talk to that woman ... who was friends with\nA doctor forward when they were younger ah I'm not sure how much further they gonna go Carl is you know like K O L T and Scott's bluff the Nebraska Carl\nHello Brian I Love your show thanks so much a lizard\nYou bet I'm just wanted to mention that to remember a Senator Reid in Nevada during the election and he brought up thing that he had information that they ever pay taxes and it was totally fall and it totally false and in the end a reporter finally asked him about it some time after the election\nAnd his response was well he did get elected ... that's exactly what's going on here\n[noise] absolutely I mean in that idiot Harry Reid or from the Democratic perspective decides to make it a simple majority a nuclear option getting these judges passed\nAnd because of that now you have Trump doing the fifty one fifty one votes these judges get through despite the thirty hour delay of game per nominee from a Schumer and now as Supreme Court justice you could have the new you have the nuclear option or else they wouldn't really have sway\nIn this process because you would need sixty votes but that was all Harry Reid's a bad play\nAnd the chocolate W. L. A. D. in Poughkeepsie New York hey Chuck\n[noise] yes which any Milo will tell you my truck\nOh yes I Want to talk about the FBI\nThe seventh to investigations yup and they've done six before as I'm told everybody told what I say is that if they turn up something now or the seventh what does this say about the other six\nWonderful which are more with more number which for them with our with our arms and legs of the president of the United states\nAnd all of oral visitors versus a very long time so I Would go back and look at the certainly somebody ought to go back and look at the previous six ah inquiries that he's been through\nWelcome to the Washington Post the president was not happy according to his advisors they cannot talk show which tentatively about drinking winners last hearing\nA and at the news conference Trump with somewhat under caught cabinet when he said this ah he that Kevin knowledge difficulty with alcohol which listen I watched him I was surprised at how\nA vocally was about the fact that he likes beer\nAnd he's had a little bit of difficulty I mean he talked about things that happened when he drank I mean this is not a man that said that alcohol was ... that he was perfect with respect to alcohol though I thought he was actually", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "02"}
