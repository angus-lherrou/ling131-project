he was just trying to um get the investigation play the\nQuote unquote nice guy to Democrats so they'd be stuck with a quick investigation and then we'd be able to do it so\nGood good tactic but I doubt that I tend to doubt it based upon his past history\nReason industry um have not talked about have not talked about something that in that I really didn't want to mention I was just reminded today um\nThat since two thousand and six there have been approximately sixty nine resolutions against Israel in the UN be above all other nations combined last\n\nSounds kind of wrong folks doesn't it sounds kind of like targeting sounds like I'm not really a big fan of the un Santa Nikki Haley's not fan of the un and what it does for us you know how many times I ran\n\nHad resolutions against

it's our obligation to look out for those that are less fortunate I'm not saying did did you\nI'm saying those that are oppressed\nHardly or pretzels are in need in danger when we can help\nWe should if we can change the direction\nWe should if we can change the direction of their countries maybe they can follow a little bit more of our type of rule of law maybe where they can allow their citizens

going to know they're going to dictate with the people's best interests at heart we don't\nCan't guarantee that so when we are the greatest nation on God's green earth isn't it our responsibility to
