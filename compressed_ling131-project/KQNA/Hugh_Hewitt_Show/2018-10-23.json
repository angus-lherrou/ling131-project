[noise]\nTwo minutes after the hours we continue our brand sitting in for Hugh Hewitt this morning and the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer and beautiful Cleveland, Ohio Peter cursing our is with us Peter as a member of the United states commission on civil rights and we're talking about the migraine caravan though a gallery of it all the politics of it all and now the security of it\nGallery of it all the politics of it all and now the security of it all Peter\nThe president said in an interview on air force one yesterday there is no limit to the number of troops he's willing to send to the border to stop this caravan he repeated that last night and has been in Houston for Ted Cruz he has the plan a re power to deny anybody admission to the United states as long as he deems it\nIn the interest of the United states has has granted him by the uh immigration and nationality act of Nineteen fifty to\nThe question is how far do you think he is willing to go and how far should he be willing to go in order to literally physically militarized that border with troops with tanks with drinks with whatever's in order to stop these migrants from getting to the port of entry where they can dust then make their asylum claims\n[noise] well I think he's willing to go as far as he can go under the law of absolutely no doubt about Hughes motivation and use determination to do that as opposed to some other presidents\nHowever a there is a you know ... ... ... conflict in terms of the law you know and it has been completely adjudicated as far as in terms of how far you can go we've got some historical perspective as to how far we can go\nBut although he's got the right I think you just indicated and we've discussed the snow asked\nTo deny classes of aliens entry into the United states and it's sort of political like the means by which he does that is subject to dispute because he is constrained in terms of the use of the military domestically but a policy kind of taught us act\nNow they're exceptions to that and held them fully litigated as to the extent of the president's power\nIn terms of using um [noise] uh troops to do that with the president can do for example is he can ask state to to you I'm a deploy the national guard he condemned federalize the national guard troops but if you ... them again he comes up against the U.S become a ... not what they can do\nIs engaging non law enforcement activity that is act as a deterrent but they can't be easy equipment or your goals they can't stop and frisk can pursue individuals\nOr act as law enforcement or you know a law enforcement capacity\nBut there are at least some would maintain there are exceptions to that and let the president might have the ability\nTo have a two ... quest that the national guard retain their state status and then they are they need potentially use them in active use you saw it deems necessary to do so but there's there is a real gray area in terms of law now\nSetting that aside as to whether or not there was affected by which would you use federalize National Guard or army troops or even state National Guard troops to engage in the kind of introduction activity\nThe presence of the army there or or of troops there\nActs as a deterrent and as a back to back stuff now you may recall that earlier in the year the president said that he was going to send troops down there and support activities to do a logistical assistance to free up the border patrol in others to\nEngage in the border enforcement activities and I think that uh you know look he's got plenty resorted to do that that's without question\nBut there was a real question as to whether or not you know some would say well the this so called caravan that's coming in who knows how large will be by the time it reaches order\nIs not really an invading force per se or it doesn't have weapons but at what point does it become a threat to national security\nYou know many of us would argue it's already a threat to national security looks at several thousand that are a threat to national security it's if it's Fifteen thousand what about if it rises level what we saw in Europe where it's tens of thousands maybe a hundred thousand\nFifth on the way it it's on the way by the way new Mexican news agencies now say that caravan is fourteen thousand and it only started a short while ago went from two thousand uh fourteen thousand by the time it gets here you know several days from now because there's still a thousand miles away Pete where we are going to be in the tens of thousands\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered invading force official to which could uh uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray areas there but I think that\nIn the first instance the president added states as the commander in chief needs to do what's necessary to secure the for\nThe border that may not include Egypt and law enforcement activity but as a tour of all you've done or is it that it is indeed that Peter thank you so much Peter curse and now us commission on civil rights for

generalist buddy still missing Saudi Arabia has ... died in\nA rural boxes diamond knowledge about the show he disappeared three weeks ago today someone sent an explosive device to the home of the liberal philanthropist George Soros\nThe billionaire wasn't added suburban New York home late Monday afternoon when an employee there to cover the fishes item alerted police and took it to a nearby wooded area where a bomb squad later destroyed it\nYou come to a port of entry again this is why a border wall and itself cannot solve everything because you just ... they these people just go to a port of entry and they claim credible fear they say I have credible fear of returning to my homeland and that's their initial basis for an asylum claim\nAnd and we we approve those credible fear claims and math so when they say I claim credible fear then they get an appointment before an immigration judge\nTo women and let me there ... or ... let me interrupt for a second to clarify something\nIt's it's my understanding that that credible fear has to be on the grounds of one of five protected grounds essentially race religion nationality political opinion or particular social group\nNone of these people are ... they're all Honduras so where you can't be rice or nationality the religion I I unless they're claiming their Muslim and they're they're being discriminated against in a largely Christian population which I don't know that they are political opinion or public particular social group they don't have any book on your mind on those grounds\nYou're right Bob but you remember just look how organized this caravan is these people are coached\nTheir coach they know exactly what to say when they get there to fall under that credible fear determination and a lot of the times works you know these people are getting approved in large numbers they were approved and a lot larger numbers in the Obama administration but they still are and that's just the initial Dermot determination\nSo they come in they get released in the interior of the country or asylum backlog is massive it's a I think it's around five hundred thousand sometimes it can take years for their claimed to be heard\nSo they get released into the country in some cases they even get work permits employment authorization documents\nSo that's what they want they know that can happen and a lotta times again they just disappear so Congress needs to tighten our credible fear standards and again with these family units and UA sees in our law right now um Mexicans are the only people that can be promptly deported\nAgain Central Americans can't be promptly repatriated at the TV PR a loophole it's called or you can get let's an asylum system as is riddled with loopholes I mean those are the main pull factors for people to come here and as long as Congress\nJust just sits on their hand that doesn't do anything these caravans will still come and keep happening and again President Trump's talking about the border wall securing funding in December but a border wall will not do much good overall with this current crisis we have in less those loopholes are also close\nOr ... helped me out help me understand this it was reported yesterday that are on Fox that the Mexican government has offered asylum to these people\nUm if that is the case we don't have to repatriate them back to Honduras or rather Mahler El Salvador we can repeat your patriot them back to Mexico\nThere are no longer in fear of persecution from their governments if we're not sending back to them back to their governments were sending them to the country that well actually we're just saying stay in the country or in right now you have been granted am not asylum at amnesty by the Mexican government\nTherefore your claim of persecution about a hundred and government holds no water\nYeah I'm I'm that we're not clear how it's exactly working out with what the Mexicans are doing in one in one instance I saw it as well that when they reached a certain area in Mexico Mexican authorities were right they're offering them an opportunity to claim asylum and then the care of and blue right past them\nAgain so ... it's it's unclear kind of how that would be treated when they do get here but again as you mentioned\nYes these people are no the fact that they entered in a safe third country they entered into Mexico shows that they are no longer fleeing violence are not willing to stay right where they are in it we can all agree as a markedly safer situation\nSo if that's the case then again I mean how how do we why do we have to then go on through the process of allowing them into the United states or is that what you're calling for you know our job when you talk about let's bring everybody back in the campaign trail and vote on this and we we if we if language does not exist in our laws that maybe that's what we need a ride and then if you have been granted\nIf you've been granted amnesty or asylum by a third party country here than your claim of asylum in the United states is no longer about\nRight no that's called a safe third country agreement again too and that would that again that is something that needs to be done with Mexico and it's something that but again those people have to be interacting with the Mexican authorities and a half to actually interact with them rather than blowing past them and just continue on to our border I mean they have to have to enter right process if you will but again\nThis is just something that Congress needs to rectify I Know President Trump is working his tail off on this issue and and and he wants to stop this caravan but again in some in some areas the administration's hands are tied again you see what the travel ban it anything this administration does on immigration ending DACA oh there are things like that\nThey get into these open borders groups forum shop they go find an activist judge\nWho who doesn't who doesn't care about our sovereignty and then they get their ruling that they want the administration can't can't can't act\nOn on our national security it's simply ridiculous that's why Congress needs to act and if Democrats want to obstruct than they should do that in front of the American people and let them decide\nAre you familiar with the Merida Initiative and if so what what what good does it do to have this\nUh but not familiar with that ... it's ... it's also called plan Mexico a it's a security cooperation between the U.S Mexico and the countries of Central America in which they're all agree to essentially not allowed to have happened what's happening right now and uh obviously music is playing so we can't get that answer an R.
