six six\nNine six seven eighty three thirty five\nSergeant at arm's will restore order in the gallery [noise]\n\nSorry order and\nThen as the vice president that is the vice president United States and he's asking for some order when Brett Kavanaugh was just too and they were collecting the votes as Kavanaugh would ultimately be confirmed but it happened multiple times and I was listening on a on the radio I wasn't seeing it but I saw it was even more horrified\nAnd then when the vice president walked out he was\nGreeted by a booze and his is a by a great number of people across the street with me right now is rich Jones\nOr find the newsman here handled in the morning for years and W. okay be in Jacksonville, Florida ah one of our great affiliates welcome to Jacksonville hey thanks rich first off I used to but even though it's Washington do you feel the anger in passion down here\nYeah I think you can I mean we haven't seen that kind of um an electric atmosphere at say like a town hall or at a campaign event necessarily so it feels like we're at a distance there but you can certainly feel it and it certainly comes through on the radio on your show and many of our other shows are alive and local show a little bit later in the morning and and through the afternoon or you can certainly hear that as well\nBut it also I I think that the take away the we have in northeast Florida is the Florida Senate race is really really tight when you look at what some of the recent polling it's been kind of back and forth where Rick Scott held at one point advantage in July from a Mason Dixon pulling their based here in Jacksonville\nIt ... there was a little bit more momentum around the incumbent the Democrat Bill Nelson and he was able to turn it a bit too about a one point advantage so I mean you were talking about one to two points wings that will happen every month or so as a new poll comes in and things and for weeks now are getting narrow razor thin we also have a big governor's race here as well\nIt had the blood too much into that it would appear maybe in the ads but not so much on the campaign trail\nOn birth to add to the whole country's watching a Gillum and somebody who's had some legal problems over in Tallahassee he seems to be able to shake that off the dissent has got off the stumbling start when some comments he made were misinterpreted but he may get a Republican since he's ready to wrap it up now was there a bit of a learning curve for the congressman I think so\nI think you know he's he's not run to that state wide race so much he did run for Florida Senate for a brief period of time when Marco Rubio was running for the White House remember to Santa's was running to replace Rubio but he really had not penetrated the state wide audience to be able to kind of make the name for himself and of course when Rubio exited the presidential race\nThe name for himself and of course when Rubio exited the presidential race to say I just went back to his house seat and likely that made the decision to ultimately run for governor would it be really interesting now is\nThe impact that what soon to become hurricane Michael may have because the Tallahassee mayor needs to be Tallahassee mayor as the panhandle in the Big Bend area prepares for possible hit and to Santa's seemingly is playing the right political cartoon saying he's going to spend a lot of the activities this week as everyone prepares for this possible impact from a store right\nYou got to be prepared we see what happens in other cities when you have no infrastructure and when you're not prepared for catastrophes for that seems to have that down but I don't want to get ahead of myself you guys seem to be able to react also noticed a lot of these lines are buried here so in New York when something hits the telephone poles go down you guys put the investment in having\nYour yeah but I I Would say that we also have tree damage and we have flooding which are big issues and storm surge is always the dangerous part of a storm I mean we get\nEven on TV and you see it on Fox News channel as well Brian where you see the reporters who were out in the elements in the wind is a big thing but storm surge is always the most powerful and flooding is the the greater killer in these kinds of events and so it may not look at an impressive as category two and three wins\nBut it's the water it's the rising water we saw with Lawrence enough parts of north and South Carolina\nThat can really be the deadly 'em up parts of the system\nFor the most part though we've had our run through the last year was a really rough year in Florida and north east war with Hurricane Irma\nWhile I don't want the and the president wants to come down and help out around saying this and he wants to help out a Rick Scott question for you from what you can tell the president won Florida and that was the beginning of the shocked him oh my goodness he might be able to win this thing in twenty sixteen but yet some ... and brick got and he or friends\nHowever is there a downside to the president coming here full voice vote\nFor my guys you know it's I I guess will ultimately seeing for weeks uh but I Would say that over the last few weeks when we've seen the president makes stops here in Florida whether it be a home a mar a Lago or if he's done campaign events it hadn't been a full throated endorsement that that maybe you would come to expect from this kind of campaigner in chief\nFor Rick Scott for example he's in Orlando today it's not a rally it's a sheriff's association and so a number and law enforcement are going to be there he'll likely mention gray police chiefs are so he's likely to talk about Rick Scott but I Wonder\nIf the way that the Trump campaign and the Scott campaign of worked kind of at arm's distance from each other if that ultimately comes back to hurt the Scott campaign it's all good we're going to sort it out in the next four weeks and will ultimately no what was or wasn't the impact of President Trump ... got Senate\nBill is instinct is to put his arm around them because they are buddies forbidden former business people who decided to get into politics and not take any money to do it\nThe negativity I heard is and you tell me if I'm right here the ... worked very hard at winning over the Hispanic community and things he does need attention given especially the the Puerto Rican influx after the slamming of there are again they relocated here somewhere still here and he's afraid of losing that on the perception that President Trump is not popular\nAll it takes a moment remember Marco Rubio when he was running in that race for US Senate on the Republican side with former governor Charlie Crist was a moment in that race\nIt was when Charlie Crist gave a hug to President Obama when he came to Florida to tell the stimulus the Rubio campaign used a hug and they were able to see a huge spike in the polls as a result because he was able to rally the conservative base of the Republican Party off that one thing so you talk about the embrace\nWhat if she got a too close too cozy from the perception\nWith President Trump how might that hurt and penetrate women for example and Puerto Ricans and others as you mentioned you never know what that one moment may ultimately be used by your opponent and how that ultimately will play out in the closing weeks of the campaign\nRich shows were this year a W okay V. help me with this red tide why is Rick Scott being blamed for red tide where he was forced out of a restaurant we understand because of protesters\nI how why use me because it's an easy thing to be able to put blame on something that's a really complex story to tell\nIt's easy if you've not followed it and you don't know the background of how this red tide situation ultimately comes to be\nEasy to be able to paint your opponents as being tied to it or somehow being blamed for it because the average person probably doesn't take the time to actually research what causes red tide and that it's far more than just one person or one policy that ultimately could impact\nRight eye and we'll see if he's able to explain that a Carrie Severino is going to be next a you know her chief counsel and a ... director of the additional Crisis Network will talk about how cabinet will be on the bench and the protests he might get rich Jones you the best thanks so I'm back alright and I'll hang up for a little while as I said the part I think he came out of your budget [laughter]\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so is he is on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate hasn't investigated than anything else will have to\nPut you on the Supreme Court so the house will do an investigation on a shooting Supreme Court justice\nShirts wanna keep politicizing across that you know have had it but I'm looking\nWant to keep politicizing the process you know have at it but um look the Senate Judiciary committee has\nDone an amazing amount an investigative work and frankly they still are looking into\nMore of these ah these ... claims that they feel like OK even you know we're we're going to at least I'm your due diligence on all of these so ah hopefully if he if he wants to do that he'll just at the Senate Judiciary committee and they can they can share their nose at that because they've already really done the work so\nI'm used to I used to be a benefit to anyone for them to do that and the you know you don't do political stuff but I just don't know if there's going to do anything except for get Republicans to the polls uh we'll see how that\nThat's something we've seen this whole time and people on the right getting so incensed at the way this has been\nJust politicized by the left everything from the way that the investigations started and and were leaked it set or the whole time it wasn't something that was good for\nJudge Kavanaugh it wasn't something it was good for doctors for that what she said she wanted it's not what it was it wasn't good for the court and it wasn't good for America so uh that's not the way to go about this process I Hope we learned if not I hope that said there are some people I Know people kind of screaming in the last maybe that's what they wanted but I don't think that's what the broad swath\nOf America how they want our confirmations to go now to be to be just a circus of uncorroborated allegations one after the other\nUh for for purely products at parties and reason so I ... and I learned a little less heat from this\nYou know I Hope so I Would say the I've been doing this now I think everybody's staring at the edge of the clip and see there was no one survives if we take one more step so my hope is going to be a sense of decorum on the next justice\nUm maybe on the next polarizing issue is going to be a Cincinnati villa flying and I think one of the first test is not villa flying weeds Murkowski or Susan Collins from making different decisions\nThan Joe mansion if Democrats want to be arrogant into Joe Manchin let us down and shame and all these things good maybe he'll continue to do that now he has no reason even feel guilty or maybe he'll do slip parties you have to look at the picture\nA ... to the big picture but I wanted to tell you a boost protest\nMight not have been organic I got the sense when I saw Jeff Flake the fact that the cameras rolling\nThe fact that all these are all these people knew exactly where the senators were coming out there was a script\nAnd vice news showing a raw Thomas said this about this ... twenty six\nWe also some people who are organized and that moment with Jeff Flake on the hill we talked to one woman who worked for ultraviolet who was paid\nShe helped steer people in the right way is to be able to to confront senator or paid there were people who are paid by organizations like ultraviolet to to try to harness that energy in a way that would make the viral moments that we ended up saying\nThat that really bothers me is a bother you\nYeah and you know we saw this as early as his his um an initial confirmation hearing to remember this isn't something that suddenly they go oh no there's been this allegation look at it that they had been opposing him from the get go some\nSenators even from before he was nominated said that's it if we can't have any one of the seat on the appointed by President Trump so um you know they they brought people said they were people who were um [noise] taking\nTaking video of people being paid at the protests during the initial hearing two hundred people were arrested that wasn't just a a you know at a spontaneous\nOr that that people decided to take go to a whole new level of of disruption and I'm really lack of civility we should be having a debate about something that's fine that's democracy but showing people down isn't and now we're heading that\nI'm engineered for TV kind of\nA moment but I I'll tell you there were a lot of people there I Know on the other side I Know there were groups of women for Kavanaugh walking Hall's not paid and it's and and people who are taking time away from their jobs their families to come in and walk peacefully in the hallways and and kind of talk reasonably with\nTheir senators not shouting now trying to get in their faces and and make a viral videos out of it but let's actually just show our support praying\nUp and down the hall so I think there's a there's a lot of people on both sides and this and we need to ... we we need to just kind of return to a moment where we can have civility and not be trying to make this about the next spectacle\nOr carry last question do you think you were there when Justice Thomas who there you saw the dynamics between the judge Supreme Court justices\nDo you think do treat him differently because of the controversy that came through the Kagan ... for example might be an briar might be like keeping them at arm's length like the Senate has become in the house has become party don't interact\nTo so called judge the justices of different political backgrounds who they know stop interacting\nI Hope not I haven't death that hasn't been how it has been so far and remember this court many of these numbers were there for Bush versus Gore I Can't imagine more politically charged and divisive case and yet they know the people you're working with for the rest of your life\nDoes it and there's no point in making 'em unnecessary enemies and people forget because we focus on the high profile cases about forty percent of the cases each year\nAre you at I'm at so there's actually a lot that bind the justice as we saw that several of them were there for his swearing in on Saturday that the the quick one so he could start getting to work Justice Kagan with their Justice Ginsburg was there and I think that's great even on an even on a kind of spontaneous for the moment thing because they were they were showing that\nUm I think the court is not the rest of the country at least knows how to work together they don't show to each other to make their points they make reasoned arguments and then they sometimes persuade each other when one way or the other that's how our system should work and I hope that um the court can be a lesson to us of how to move forward as a country\nAbsolutely and I love with that I Want to see him go bears we writers wrote an being sarcastic I'm just glad we've ruined his wife who later to cut down so well and you know would would you say that\nUm I mean that that that that is the tragedy of what it seems like they're going for that hey you know what we can't block you but at least we can ruin your life that's horrible I don't think\nAny I I just hope that that is a narrow French Americans who actually want our politics to go that way but I think the best thing he can do now is to move forward to the Justice Thomas and say you can't ruined my life I I I'm going to go forward and limit I'm going to live out my oath to uphold the constitution and\nThat that will be I think his best final argument and that is to have a you know continue to sit on the court and bringing those ... those really principled decisions and that continued to be the kind of even handed fair justice that is that he has been on the news ... up until now\nUh Gary who's who's been grabbing loving your contributions on TV and radio thanks so much for your time\nYou great to be\nAll right ah in the cabinet or Iran has a
