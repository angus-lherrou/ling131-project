dialogues I think I've ever conducted with Dr Larry on President Bill Bill college all\nThings wholesale Hillsdale dot edu because there is abroad and the political discourse a really dumb argument and it's a hard life is hard but it's harder when you're stupid and it's really hard or when you do not understand what the Senate is about\nAnd it's really harder when you do not understand what the Senate is about and I have seen it everywhere doctor on\nThe Senate is a deeply offensive institution\nWhen in fact it is the the the tendons been hold the country together and we were talking about wind New York didn't want a Senate and why bridging you didn't want a Senate but we had to have a Senate in order to have a republic please continue\nWell in New York in in Virginia and Massachusetts big big powerful states they were very reluctant about a strong central government in general right\nAnd then and then the Senate protecting the little states that was you know that of course they didn't want that and they you know and it's it before you emphasize that interest drove all of these discussions too much\nThere's a way that they came together for ratification that this proves that and I'll mention that in a minute\nBut of course right now you know they're trying to they're trying to unite the country and they did that and that just that singer 'cause you have to think back to the fact that this had never been done before\nNobody had ever built a country like this this this started out with the basic principle which it's born and then extend that to the consent of the govern made necessary by that principle this is the first thing in the world in human history to undertake that\nSo so they um they um so they have to you know they're going to figure out a way to do it and you know if you think now you know the big countries of the great rule you know but the truth is they aren't right the European Union is an attempt to unite the European continent\nAnd it's falling apart right and China has got intermittent at this assemblies of itself right and the Russian Federation you know is strained at the corners right\nAnd so and and yet these big powerful countries have a better a means of defending themselves and the small weak countries you know if you want to keep your independence for sure and certain for the rest of the time you don't really want to be Belgium 'cause\nThey've managed to survive but it took some really big countries getting on their side to help that happen yeah so how do you hold them together right and\nThis is you know this is the American experiment right and remember this experiment was conducted on a new continent right never been anything like didn't know how big it was you know anything much about it really\nAnd so they so they uh\nTheir idea was local thing will be governed cheaply by local things and then the Senate becomes a protection in the national thing of the prerogative of the local things and that that device\nIs a powerful um it's a powerful a protector\nYou know you need you need to explain that again it becomes a powerful national interest in the protection of local interests would you get in on that\nWell it was better when the Senate was ... was appointed by state legislatures although I confessed filled is this the Senate was often not very important in that time because first of all there wasn't this whacking big federal government\nWith the ability to reach into every town I mean there's a federal institution installation basically in every town\nAnd they do they don't just do the post office anymore now there's you know local and private thing of all kinds\nThat are that are that are that are influenced by the federal government and so that that wasn't possible\nWhen the Senate was chosen but the state legislatures and I would go back to that although I think there's little prospect of it because I think that would be a really good uh um\nYou know we're not going to I Would ah we're not going to reopen the seventeenth amendment as a practical matter I'm against it can mentioned the states as a matter as well but when we come back we're gonna continue to talk about the glory of the Senate and this current eruption of attacks upon it as an institution\nNot on any particular decision the decision to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is a great and good decision\nBut it launched it triggered on the left a mad cap rushed to denounce the Senate and we stand here as we always do every Friday at this hour with Dr Larry on\nThe hill down by a laundry reminding people

elections in Afghanistan Kandahar Province tomorrow being delayed a week over an attack killing three top officials including a police chief us defense secretary James Mattis says\nA Hillary Clinton's America is a centralized urban sophisticated you know academic and the modern and corrupt sent\nA America and the people outside it they're ignorant and you know they really need the management because what they would do left to their own devices deplorable\nSo you want to and and the whole idea because you know the people who wrote the constitution the United states they were pretty sophisticated people you know I Would put their education up against Hillary Clinton for example\nAnd they know they had every reason to ah you know want their place to dominate and all of that but what they ... they are but that would never bring them together into a consensus to pass a constitutional or for that matter to make the revolution [noise] they had to find some principle that would be good for everybody\nIn print you and I had then practice\nWhen I I've been reading this week a Stanley McChrystal the general the army was so successful in Afghanistan and Iraq until Rolling Stone took him out because a new book out with a couple of coauthors called leaders and it begins\nWith a reflection on what Alexander Hamilton to during the long winter in valley forge nobody did Larry aren't he studied Pluto park and took copious notes on the lives with you and I spent many weeks on studying Pluto and if you study Pluto you study the danger of the mob in Athens you study what ... can do it or towards can do\nAnd so the senators a check on the mob it it it is absolutely sure our liberty but by mixing it up with the race notice talking about the white people in my own I don't talk about race except when the left provokes me to it\nBut they wish to Memphis again or racial discussion and it isn't it's about preserving individual freedoms for everyone regardless of their race\nYeah and see the mob thing you know we get we get mobs in America today more it's you know it's a sign of the of the intensity of the crisis that we're in its intensifying and it is a crisis of the house divided another one\nAnd it's a sign of it that you get violence and mobs and people running and you know I mean I somebody told me something that made me feel gloomy said apparently there's some very large number of law professors who signed a thing and that Brett Kavanaugh shouldn't be acceptable\nFor him tells in four hundred law professors yeah males and\nYou know but what about that right I mean aren't they supposed to be people who are trained and then train others that before you're going to believe a bad thing about anybody you should try to prove it yeah and that and you know you need evidence right and uh and then you have to have\nBecause it's funny you know in in the American legal system the bedrock of it is not judges and lawyers it's juries right ordinary people and they make the ultimate decision\nAnd there's no accident I Wish to underscore this that when the ... composition of the Supreme Court was up for the people in Philadelphia to decide they gave the president the power to nominate and the ... Democratic Senate equally state represented Senate the right to confirm and the house was excluded from that process\nAnd I think it was because Dr aren't they did not want the majority ... influence on the people who would be making the laws\nThat's right that's right and well you know 'cause remember the whole point ... you you can't say that without also at the point that that ultimately it is to people in their majority who should rule\nAnd so how do you set up a system where there is deliberation and debate and ultimately the people will and if if if\nAnd and you know any people by the way if you if you look at a mob anywhere in the world what you're saying is a bunch of human beings who is capable of good behavior and and so you need a system for them to participate in that will respond to that good behavior\nAnd not to they're marching in the streets you know I I read an article on the fact that having apparently a long time ago that the Palestinian authority or when they got their government their parliament set up they passed a law that it was the death penalty to sell the land and land in the west bank to a Jew\nAnd then apparently a horde of them left the place and marched down the street with a bunch of others and arrested some people and beat them and I think they might have killed one of them right so you know that that's the mob and ... you can't have that and that\nAnd so this idea that it's just you know ... right there and had a way with words he said in all cases majority rule but for the rule to the rightful it must be reasonable and protected the rights of minorities\nAnd that when we come back for the final segment of this week's Hillsdale dialogue is what will focus on how does the majority rule even when you have an anti majority turning institution like the Senate and the answer will be they rule constitutionally through mediating institutions that are designed exactly and functioning exactly\nThey were designed to do and oh it is

can change life liberty and norms on ... market you want to have ... impressing valley where ...\n[noise]\nI\nSend the military to defend our southern border that just because the illegal immigration onslaught\nBrought by the Democrats\nWell there's loopholes and need to be closed and the attraction and magnet it up\nAnd about eight thousand a day or come into our border and border patrol was helpless they're not trying to re the border they're giving themselves up in order to uh get some shelter and then within twenty days get their ankle bracelets and then for the most part we understand Ninety percent cut them off we never see him again\nIs that any type of immigration policy for a Democrat or Republican it shouldn't be and the president saying I got up in the morning was so outraged by the caravan barreling to our border he made that statement causing some controversy\nMicrowaves is one of the stores here on on a W W J be over in in Tampa but one of our great affiliates and that's where I Am in Studio today Mike you've been up you're the same hours as me yeah so you're you know you we can't go out and party like we used to because we gotta get up\nEarly the hell do I party all the time rarely you're a big dance certain as your caller I quit drinking twenty five years ago and when when I started doing mornings you can't do it right but I I still I Am I'm Jealous of the people that can\nWell this would be ... it would be today are either go to AA meetings or get a morning show and then you have to make a decision\nThere's never a morning by my exaggerating a bit but there's rarely a morning where I don't get up not happy to do to be at it I mean because I Love doing this so much and there's so much news it's just a ton of fun\nRight so what does your winters but how much does a immigration illegal immigration legal immigration how much does it matter the people of Florida to the people who listen to you [laughter] it\nBecause they say it's a three to one of the three big issue it's I wouldn't say it's the largest issue here because we don't want to see it but it's definitely high on people don't like the lack of security on the border more than anything is we don't see the immigration problems here like we do out west\nRight you know I I I was out there ten Fifteen Years ago are going to a a ski resorts and and I I saw people from all over the world these different groups of folks coming in I mean I was telling people here in Florida I say\nThe west coast does not look like Florida and it's coming this way and so people are hearing about it in the news right now and the lack of security along the borders everybody gets that ... that's a big issue\nSo you got to go to races have the whole country looking you look at a governor Rick Scott wants to be centers got take notes and seeing it looks like a virtual dead heat can you give it to ... cents on the ground in Florida how you think it's going\nGovernor Scott started out very unpopular in slowly become popular and he's he's been at it in a people like him he's done a great job with the economy is that let's get to work and he spoke laser focused on that and then he's shown himself to be a tremendous administrator\nDuring hurricane recovery and his polls who started to come up he suspended his campaign and his ... started to come up because he's getting this great free advertising showing what he's good at\nHurricane might he's he's he's handling a he's doing a fantastic job up there so you have a round to say it as soon as making his name a military background making his name on Foreign Relations really a white Jim Jordan and others are taking on what's going on the FBI and the investigation of Donald Trump but then he says I'm going to run for governor and the president says he got my I got your back\nBut yet he wants to continue more of Rick Scott's policies that has a state really rolling and killing doesn't the mayor of Tallahassee he's got an FBI investigation Tallahassee is not a smooth during operation but he's got a lot of charisma and poise on the stump why do you think this is a dead heat [noise]\nBecause we're a purple state no other reason than that I was talking to congressman Dan Webster is one of our two main Congress and the major goes during a yesterday I asked him that same question I I that I said why is going to ask me what it used to and he says because we're a purple state that's the only reason\nBut the word is getting out on what Gillum stands for and I said at the very beginning forget these polls\nThis guy's a socialist and AIDS the word is going to get out into the saddest will be able to just tell the truth about him and his poll numbers have come up and get almost will go down I think he'll be tight but I think the Santos has it\nBut one thing about Florida I thought it was Democrats or Republicans were coming here because of the tax situation yeah and as somebody ... made it clear on raising taxes\nFor retirees come down here from New York and they don't want to pay taxes that I don't blame and things are a lot cheaper here and he wants to raise the prices making more expensive ...\nRight and I'm surprised that that resonates in a state like this\nI don't think the issues are resonating at all and I think it's just that we are fifty fifty Republican Democrat and there is course across the nation\nAnd a lot of states they are very anti Trump right man coalitions not everywhere but it's you know foreigners fifty fifty now I'll be I'll be honest with you I don't know anybody that is a liberal at that like the ones we see portrayed on TV you know maybe that's because of the circles by running but I don't know where those people are here in Florida\nRight you're saying that uh the people that support deal and you don't know them not at all so that's why I live in a neighborhood that are they're all Republican right so that'll do it right but the un and up here we are very conservative here but I'm I'm moving to Alachua County University of Florida and uh\nThey're liberal up there and I don't hear in a big buzz for Gillum but I Would imagine there is more so than here great time to talk radio host in Florida absolutely sure it's always a great time of the lord is a great time regardless right\nIn hurricane Mike when she had so far away but do you still feel it does it feel like they're that your brother in\nAbsolutely into all of our share of saw who I've talked to all the time they're they're deployed people in fact the citrus county sheriff is up there now and they're they're helping out\nThese Mike ... is a great job here on W. W. J. B. holding down in the morning and making sure I've my goal is not to lose his huge audience Mike thanks so much in a season I Mac and while you're helping me out back you know I've showed sacrifices while [noise]\nWhose knocking out people but they say he's not going to be able to stand Joe Frazier's left talking memory you can hear her Frasier he just one Fifteen ran to the Bahamas Ali and knocked him down\nAnd next thing you know to see Frasier go down before your eyes and who this ... was his George Foreman and who smiles once every ten years they said didn't know this guy's going to be champions forever\nAnd Frazier said to me and my first big interview ever I interviewed him at the Waldorf and I'm interviewing him and I said he said I Would love to form and again he goes but I don't think it will be a different result my goal in life would be to get in the ring with tighten at this time Tyson's twenty three years old\nAnd it was just hadn't beaten up its on yet more of an\nAnd I said why would you want to get in the ring with Tyson people were afraid he goes I just want to feel it I just want to feel how powerful he is and I thought to myself that is a different mindset than I couldn't even understand yeah\nOr many failed out fest she had a housing and to my job I really just want to feel may I say incidentally ... this anecdote that you're told now was gold you need to include that in your performance tonight because I think talking about Joe Frazier and George Foreman from forty years ago your audience is going to love this\nWhile I Can't believe that I thought we were bonding and it really does is exactly the reverse\nThat I I don't know I think we're all guys and you know I said we could do well at a retirement village I said I have a rubber wherever that Frasier form a fight oh my God at Howard Cosell ... goes down\n\nHow ... how how did you get that that is uh Pete and Eric are doing the magic behind the scenes ... actually I tried it and it wasn't actually goes down goes ... ... that was great that when we were like Eric\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] wow I mean come on let's go now that there's got to stop I Would definitely probably to hear an hour and a half of of Howard Cosell of course he's passed on this mortal coil so that would not be so where did you have you met him yes a debt but my father I met him a few times and did you like him\nWell I'm caught it it was a larger than life he was this the showman and he was you know he was identified with every big sports event in the world and sure I was I was excited to made him\nYeah I mean he gave relevance to everything he made you feel as those sports mattered more than ever\nBecause you know what he said even when you were critical of 'em and if he was full of himself I get it but just his voice and when he hit his voice said what was happening\nHow could this man who stood the fury of Muhammad Ali or be be going down so easily with from this Olympic champion but I'll talk a little bit now since we had a chance to reminisce ending your terms board people I'm\nBehind is going to say I ... I think you're Howard Cosell Rodman essence is going to work very well to tonight I think you go to Jackie Jackie Roosevelt Robin sun not the man who wrote the color line\nOkay I'll I'll I'll go to rescue the segment can we do that\nI think it's gone I think we're on life support for a guy had put the different ... out there let's try to say I I\nI'm going to do it but before I play the sound bite I Will tell you I have no problem with it because I've been watching Donald Trump I get it cut one\nQuick Greg get smart and by the way never wrestle him\n[noise]\nGuy that your body slamming my God I didn't say that there's nothing that we endorsed Greg very early but I had heard that he body slammed the reporter\nGreat team forte who ended up winning a special election in Montana and so Ryan think he'd see the president having fun with the fact that he did that instilled one that's Trump do you have a problem with it\nWell I think this ... taking a week and I and I know people are going to eyes are stuck in the mud but this particular week when the world is focused on the brutal murder of Jamal to show gay I Know there are different things I'm not sure that setting they're having fun\nWith a guy who attacked and hurt a reporter who was just doing his job is is is necessarily the smartest of\nAll right let's move on and talk I see I I don't see any relation and you know Trump that he's a little different is that George Bush breaking format\nYou know it's it's not Bill Clinton doing that it's way the way he does he he plays into this massive audience who believes what he believed by the way his crowds are out of control large and and and\nYou know I think your crowd tonight is going to be what on under control small huh\nI think it's going to be out of control but you can ... I don't I Will I'm very ... I Can't wait for you to tell them eight next week how this went\nWell not only that I had a a double axle into the into the eyes of\nChris Saturday is in Norfolk, Virginia so and then Sunday is in Nashville and then I'm done and we'll see how that goes and then when they might\nNot Sunday you might get it together I think I Would I Would go to the national performance because I think Tampa is probably going to be a disaster\nThere's not going to be a disaster like do\nFolks if you're looking for a train wreck it'll be entertaining there's no question about it will be entertaining\nHome goodness to not have Chris Wallace in my corner is really disconcerting\nI'm like a ... man for a fighter too like when George Foreman fought Frasier a you know I like the government cut bait jet Jimmy cut by\nRight that was that was a rocky movie but I Know I mean and by the way no one ever said that that was just for the movies Saudi Arabia let's talk about it Mike Pompeo goes to visit goes to visit Turkey's trying to put a put this thing together or or is he trying to get his story together here is my ... at the White House cut twenty seven\nYear old President Trump this morning that we ought to give them a few more days to complete that we do with understanding of the facts surrounding that were born we can make decisions about how the United states should respond to incidents surrounding this show you\nSo do you have a problem with the president's pace in this investigation and do you agree the secretary of state as I said the president to give the Saudis some time\nI think asking Saudi Arabia to do a transparent\nAnd complete investigation of what happened ...\nIs like asking OJ Simpson to do an investigation of who killed the coal brown ... clearly the Saudis were involved in this clearly was a Saudi hit squad that killed this guy ... where there are direct orders from a ... but the the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nDaughter is from a ... but the the crown prince Mohammed bin ... and but yes I don't know but I think that whoever did it knew that he would he would like it and it wasn't a obsessed with it and my guess is that you wouldn't do it without his approval\nAnd I you know we do have a real dilemma here because it was a horrible attack it was a ... barbaric action on their part how they ever thought they were going to get away with it\nI I don't know but having said that we do have a relationship with Saudi Arabia or that you can't just blow up we depend on the cheap oil we depend on them as a as a counterweight to Iran and all sorts of stability in the middle east but a ... you can't let this thing go unpunished and even if he wanted to\nThere are a lot of top members of Congress including a lot of top Republicans like Lindsey Graham life Bob Corker like our guest on Sunday Rand Paul who were saying I don't care what our relationship is was with Saudi Arabia you can't just let this pass and act as if nothing happened here\nChris ... what is enough\nWhat is it enough so you said you you admit that you can't blow up the relationship the president thinks out loud you don't have to get a source within the White House that has the president's mind so that he actually tells you he said but this is bad if this is true if you knew about it it's real bad All right uh what's it we don't know but if there is a tape\nOr if they show it's real bad what is enough\nI don't know that I I mean I'll be honest I don't know but I think you have to do something that hurts that says to the world\nThat we don't countenance that that that is not the way the U.S and us allies act\nAnd uh you know I don't you know people are saying well we need to get a A N be outside of their last time I checked I don't think we have control over the royal family but it but I Will say does somebody said that that\nThat MBBS mum had been so I'm On the crown prince who's really running the country but trade\nUs because we've put a lot of effort but this was the first trip down to the President Trump took in in twenty Seventeen first foreign trip was Saudi Arabia we put a lot of eggs in that basket and for him to act in such a a blonde and reckless fashion\nReally a under cuts us in the in the middle east and around the world uh so I you know he's he's not a bright dependable allied there's no question about it\nAnd keep keep in mind we will do it if you have a pen handy when it got that down Rand Paul doesn't want to see in the middle east at all it's not like you're saying I was supporting Saudi Arabia into this killing he wanted out of Afghanistan he wants his out of Iraq he wants to add to that one about\nLindsey Graham Lindsey Graham doesn't feel that way\nOh I Know but I'm just saying the gift that you have is already he felt that way oh\nBecause I trust your parents tonight you're now going to trash my guess nice\n[laughter] well I'm not saying they're unrelated I'm not saying there might be where they believe\nThe grand did say on our show he's calling for that crown prince believe in a new crop brains to come in he like yeah I did not do that kind of do we get a vote on who the crown prince of Saudi Arabia's I punch my ballot you didn't you do you oh you have a hanging I got an absentee ballot oh you do look yeah so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city":
