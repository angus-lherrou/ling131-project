tried with white water and and ah it it became a star and Monica Lewinsky and indeed this is just the latest in a line of sort of increasingly desperate things Democrats or Republicans have resorted to\nTo try to take down Bill Clinton it was viewed in that context and and it's it's it's language I I've seen on the other side in relation to to Ford and Kevin on this in the last week\nNo yeah it say it will resonate with everyone on every level but let's dig into the nineties I think probably the seminal moment is not the election of Bill Clinton do that is for history but for politics it's the counter revolution in Nineteen Ninety four\nI Would live on PBS in LA I hosted the local PBS show with Patt Morrison kind of medics when we went live on Nineteen Ninety four I can remember Claire Isabel if there was a fight they stop it it was such a traumatic event for the Democrats fifty two house seats lost nine Senate seats you know Richard Shelby switch parties immediately after\nWhat made the carnage even worse I don't know that twenty ten or twenty fourteen whereas traumatic to the political system is Nineteen Ninety four what do you think's the current acting\nI completely agree and one of the reasons twenty ten and twenty fourteen weren't as traumatic was because we've been through Nineteen Ninety four and and I had to put it in\nPerspective for folks who who who weren't following it back then or maybe a forgotten a little bit I mean it had been forty years in Nineteen Ninety four since Republicans had control the house\nAnd they hadn't even been close you know we've got a midterm coming up right now\nWe're Democrats are again of twenty three seats away it's it it may it may not happen but it's doable for them and it just seems like every election we go into these days it's it's conceivable that control the house could switch um it was inconceivable for decades in American politics from the fifties in the Nineteen nineties\nThe Republicans who control the house it was known as a permanent Democratic Congress the speaker's gavel was was handed down almost like a hereditary tool\nUm from one democratic speaker to another\nOr Republicans were you know eighty Ninety a hundred seats buried in the majority\nIn the minority excuse me and it was an expectation heading into Nineteen Ninety four that it would be a good year for Republicans you know the Clinton presidency had been very rocky his approval rating\nOr was pretty low but the the thought going into election night Ninety four with a a good night\nRepublicans will pick up the Senate and make a dent in the house um when the returns started coming in I mean things started happening that night like a speaker of the house Tom Foley lost re election in his home district that hadn't happened since the civil war\nOr Dan Rostenkowski this just sort of old bowl chair of the ways and Means Committee he'd been um he was later you know prosecuted but I'm\nA Dan Rostenkowski lost his seat in Chicago I mean this is this is like this is a district that was like forty points democratic and Dan Rostenkowski loses his seat there Mario Cuomo who is the\nThe um it wouldn't most famous or in the love and liberals in the country in Nineteen eighty four loses in New York state I'm just happening all over the map and and to go back and\nAnd relive the the the way this was regarded in the moment and Newt Gingrich of course become speaker of the house this was this was also unsinkable in politics\nBecause he'd been a a back venture and into his own party even an irritant just a few years earlier [noise]\nUm but it was they were serious discussions of in the media in the wake of that election that not only was Bill Clinton finished that was taken as a given but that the Democratic party and liberalism itself where we're headed for in immediate extinction\nIt was also the first media shock now I have often tell people\nIf the media had a concussion protocol we'd all still be in it after twenty sixteen you and I were together on election night twenty sixteen but\nThe shock of Nineteen Ninety four was as great it was like Nineteen eighty and it doesn't occur very often and you read describe it for our millennials out they're going to be fascinated by the way is the current acting that in the red and blue\nPeople who are still on the front page like Nancy Pelosi are playing very large rolls I Want to cook from page three sixty nine where\nA speaker of former Speaker Pelosi at that time just to leading Democrat was commenting on Monica Lewinsky uh I don't think it happened but if it did it comes to the big surprise I don't think for one moment there's an atmosphere of sexual harassment and the White House\nI read that because you're not easy on anyone here just telling the story yeah because I Want my conservative audience understand the Connecticut plays this right down the middle and the rent and the blue you're not this is not an advocacy book this is a narrative of a a multi decade\nI think you were saying that because that's exactly what I Would I aim to do here I'm In I'm just trying to explain how we ended up the goal with the book um is to use as sort of the endpoint election night two thousand and it's the closest thing to a perfect time we've ever seen\nIn a presidential election in this country comes down to\nThose five hundred thirty seven votes in Florida the Supreme Court ruling the recount and all of that and I think that division that map that just almost perfect split down the middle of the country I I think it's the product of of all of the political battles and political wars of the Nineteen nineties that that just took Americans and\nAnd made them choose sides Democrat or Republican\nI'm In and I think each party and its own way contributed to it the way it the way it responded to the other party the way a played off the other party the way it unintentionally reinforced what their party was trying to do um you know I write about a one aspect I write about here is sort of the rise of Newt Gingrich and his style of politics in the house\nWhich of course culminated in his his grandest our that that night in Nineteen Ninety four when he become speaker and one of the things you see I I think that I that I Hope people see at least in reading this is in that long\nI think that I that I Hope people see at least in reading this is in that long rise of Newt Gingrich and the house um he's absolutely changing a lot of the norms and traditions and blowing them up and embracing a much more combative style but\nThe Democrats who the prominent Democratic majority as it was known back at that time they played right into his hand and they ended up pushing a button through the waste particularly house speaker Jim Wright says the guy from the late Nineteen eighty particularly the way he ran the house\nIt pushed Republican moderates into Newt Gingrich's camp and it left the moderates saying you know what we're getting nowhere with the leadership we've been following for three decades let's give this guy new to try\nBob Michel a great gentleman but not a change agent like new I Love the fact quote\nThe first thing

Republicans debate has been activated mistakes and we've seen that bear out in the numbers in North Dakota for example I hike camp we seen a mirror out in Tennessee\nThere you go are you are now looking at a situation with one months ago it's a sprint to the twenty Eighteen midterms where the party stands and what they both have to do\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I open Senate will do so is he is on the Supreme Court and the Senate has investigated than anything else will have to\nHave a Jerry ... is chairman of his committee he will do that as the Democrats from New York you can we keep politics out of the Supreme Court sadly chances are that looked bleak as pillow see\nBut er and many on Kavanaugh aside investigate and the president says accusations of a hoax both sides are make anything better from Iran in talking about accomplishments which president by Nancy Pelosi talk about why you want to get in power but to leave the Supreme Court out of politics possible\nNumber one I\nNumber one I\nGreat event last night as the swearing in officially took place Brett Kavanaugh joined joined the group or nine on\nThe Supreme Court ah congratulations it's official and Brett Kavanaugh has already got his staff all female and they're ready for action environmental issues talk about executive power issues bottom line he's working what I Hope to do now\nIs the president should go out on the stump and these people Republicans you should go out and say we have to refer to Supreme Court justices to Mitch McConnell should Trump at that but I Would leave a lot of the politics out of it not saying that it wouldn't benefit you Republicans but I think it would be benefit the country more\nTo stop talking politics in the Supreme Court\nSo would you want to do with degrees those nine to be a a team\nTo let them know or to vote together will be better to vote honestly is is correct but most importantly the president saying hoax and Democrats coming out and saying peach and then other saying investigate it don't waste of time he's not going to be impeached you go to investigate and find nothing there is nothing\nIt to companies were looking for new

to six three four zero for quality committed car siren Prescott valley [noise]\n...\n\nI put President Trump does he say in the car for hours and hours of the reality shows\nAnd that's what he knows how to do\nThe problem though for\nJoe and people like yourself is successful careers somehow articulated what a lot of people fail which is boy I guess everybody gang up too much on this guy it was unfair and I think it was on a showing that Donald Trump\nAlmost with the help of the Democrats have been married or something that should have played very strongly and ... and it's something that is going to on ballots help Republicans especially running for the Senate because five paving it as a notion of mob people try to destroy those nice man\nUh somehow or another he changed the narrative\nSo ah so small world tried to teach in a very uh an extraordinary story and to give the Benjamin Franklin you might know did was ask personally by Steve Jobs to do his biography will while he was still alive and to be as brutal as you want to be\nBut uh the the ... is as a way in which he's not taking sides used to run CNN by the way so he's not taking sides you know where he stands he's probably outraged by dropping candy I recoiled but the notion of him being president I imagine\nBut for him to say that it's just that's called accurate analysis accurate analysis and why the guy we spoke about yesterday Michael ... cut sixteen\nBright under Donald Trump's hands whether what is often the way Michael Gerson writes about it that way understandably a passionate Democrats self had to show the same fashion\nThat some Republicans have but they play then to the hands of those who thought this was a mob rural\nAnd that people want listening to both sides and it was a shame that the Democrats in my opinion so overplay their hand because up until then whichever way the vote when he was going to help the Democrats male if the Democrats in the mid term election\nI think the Democratic politicians in that really ought to go into another line of work you know you can't win a mentor to get a different type of job\nFor me to tell you the big story in the Democratic side who's paying all these protesters one thing is to be outraged the other one is doing it as a job so you go there and you have a strategy of how to head off a senator you have a strategy about how to interrupt a dinner you have a strategy about how to get on\nCamera and they're all getting paid they're all getting paid and yeah it does take away the authenticity if you're protesting something I think you should be there I don't think it should be a profit oriented adventure deal\nI mean maybe for the travel agent if they want to build in some travelling incentives for hotel in buses but once you get the air you should be sacrificing something not earning something go get a regular job in protest when your free time\nYou being paid for a point of view by other people who have a lot of money and they want you to go ahead and do the legwork unbelievable\nBut that's what we're seeing any of these hundred percent right the guy that I Am so glad is lost the prestige in glow is Michael ...\nAnd his sweat Nick person who came forward and said\nYou know that a judge Kavanaugh then Brett Kavanaugh was out there might have been spiking the punch by never saw might have been involved with a group that was never there might have been part of my sexual assault but I don't remember really those are the allegations Michael ... brought forward and almost everybody to a person said that\nHis allegations were so out of left field an unsubstantiated it ruined the entire cause\nIt made for the most credible and Ramirez as you know the freshman at Yale could not remember originally what happened took care of herself a week Democrats crawling over campus trying to find somebody that saw something about something that cabin or did\nAnd the New York times that I can write this the New Yorkers and I'd love to write this\nSo that ... talking about they have thoroughly overplay their hand them for the most part the president to events do you like to take back although as in my mind should take\nBack a little has twenty days besides that he's been perfect peace been perfect and we'll see if it translates because we know that George Bush could not bring along anybody in his mid term elections and we know they do a Brock Obama had the worst mid term elections of any modern president gradually he lost his party almost everything\nAnd now this president says oh yeah I'm going out\nNow they told I think it was a la carte a will say no excuse me George Stephanopoulos so that you know when Bill Clinton won the presidency you want to make sure the wind is Margie prevent a big losses in the mid term so we went out and they checked oppose after he started helping out congressmen and women and they went down in almost every worry appear to have stayed home\nThis is another thing different about President Trump the approval rating might be forty one percent but when he goes out ... momentum excitement he gets big crowds and they're always they're always going crazy and then he creates news down by the people who run maybe putting disdain because of the things he said\nWell maybe the news were newsworthy because of who showed up\nSo this guy is different in every way him by the way he is taking on the number one enemy of America China in every way he stopped him in South America he's challenging them in Africa he's going ahead and plus preventing them from dominating the south China Sea by making land masses out of the ocean\nAnd China does not know what to make them up because some of the protests that have left behind closed doors are now happening in front of the camera and you saw the last weekend [noise]\nHate to tell you for Democrats are happy about this one takes takes for all eight seven six six nine Senate colonel Allen West\nAnd there are folks who tend to believe that that is never been a successful economic model anywhere in the world of basketball the socialist a economic model ears and that's what we have to try to educate these voters are to include what we see with these threats coercion intimidation and the violence in front of the progressive social is left\nToday so what's at stake I mean right now there's a seven point difference in the generic ballot in between the Republicans and Democrats were not voting for people how do you feel about the party seven point to do a ... for the party in power doesn't mean a ton obtainable bought asked what do you expect to happen in the next four weeks\nI think the next four weeks there has to be a clear delineation about uh the path that the United states of America is on right now would you look at all of our economic success\nIn the past that an opposition party wants to take it towards and again just look at the images of people climbing on statues there at the Supreme Court bay and all the walls is this where we really want that we really want to move away from the rule of law\nTowards a rule of law and that's that's really the question we have to ask ourselves all you have people like Tom Perriello leadership of the Democratic party\nThat are not denounce in this day are truly encouraging or of it that's not what we want to be an American\nGuy didn't think so so we're we at right now Greg Valerie he's a a political columnist talked about what this whole cabinet or confirmation battle has done cut thirty to\nForty this morning I think that the Republicans have a full outlets jar sorrows and Maxine Waters and Michael ... knock on the air and the entire Democratic Party but they do have a foil and I think that in ... districts where the Republican they kind of indifferent\nFair motivated now so it makes a difference but today it's a lot of October knife who knows what's gonna happen between now and election day there can be more wild card\nThere could be and you see that now all of a sudden CNN is reaching for some type of twenty sixteen issue Israelis might help Rick Gates with some type of negative or do negative ads against Ted Cruz in the primary\nSo you know they're going to reach the mother when Kavanaugh failed its own dog has treated as if they have about a hundred stories in their quiver and they decide when to release the time or the time bomb\nWithout a doubt they have a strategic war room and you're right there and look at this at each and every way that they possibly can and if there's a avenue of approach trails and we'd go to Costa ... numbers city or plan B or planet F\nA and this is what we're up against we're up against people that are seeking to obtain power and control ... dominance in the states of America is an ideological dominance instead of them sitting back and say you know look\nThe more Americans working at before our our stock markets with oil for all the cage door where foreign policy look at what would just it was ready to go ... this trade trade deals\nOur military is being a you know re strength and brought a good path though for them and it's about the painting power and getting back control and why do they want that control because they want to make this country on a different path\nSo a couple of things when you see my palm pay when the foreign minister of China allow public ... what is colonel Allen West thing somebody was station nearby and Korea\nI think is very important that we let the Chinese know that we're not going to accept the status quo anymore we let them know that the fast of our intellectual property and the you know forcing a technology transfers\nOr it's not going to happen anymore and we're going to close the uh the circle around them we're gonna have better trade negotiations and deals with others\nAnd if they don't want to be a part of the civilized society if they want to continue down their path that they have chosen as a communist country or they're not going to be welcome and we're not going to couch without this was no longer the Obama foreign policy of strategic patience\nRemember how President Obama left off\nHis last visit to China and the American media was stuck into one small room away from the event and he has for the United states was forced to leave leave off the cargo entrance and enter a and into the event ah I mean you know and into the event and then of course me the leader of China\nThat is humiliating I mean they would not open the door they would not line up the stairs so he had to go out to the emergency exit so this president said okay I'll get to know you will try it you're not moving your not budging you're still a problem so we'll battle it out everywhere I think it's so genius it will go in India and it was saying how can we help you how can we worked together\n... absolutely so because one of the phase is now the Chinese Pakistan economic corridor that they're trying to establish China is building a poor facility in Pakistan so I think that it is important that we go to other allies like you say if you let's say that you know we're going to check you and we'll go to check make you\nMake a colonel congratulations your book drops tomorrow go pre order now hold Texas hold the nation victory or death talked about the history of
