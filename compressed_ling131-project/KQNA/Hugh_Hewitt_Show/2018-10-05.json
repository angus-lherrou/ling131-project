great\nAll the due process is what Matt Spalding thank you for the call and due process is understood intuitively by Americans\nKnow and and and that's why I think this is a I I'm I'm actually very hearted by this um and and their reactions show that those those core principles of\nA western civilization for God's sake or are still there this is this is very good and it and they've seen that due process I mean what does this guy is innocent until proven guilty of the opposite uh it just\nBefore them and they're seeing through these comments people are reading this day by day they're putting it together and they're coming to this conclusion it's it's a it's an amazing thing this this reaction\nKelly in New York state Kelly or on with Dr Matthew Spalding on the Hugh Hewitt show should Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nYes why I in the area that we're in a situation\nThat you have a father has been rather than\nTo let every American women now that the Democrats are hunting for that\nThey can be completely innocent\nAnd all they have to do is say one thing or ... make one incorrect thought\nThey went out or whining politically incorrect statements\nJust being disliked\nHas\nA conservative temperament or view of the world\nAnd not that\nOne on and that's that is I knew and hit an accusation that cabinet and in your life\nThat will be the cabinet standard and I'm methods falling people are not aware of that they're aware of the new standard dream forced upon the process here\nNo I I I think they're picking it up in this is a ... you know so this particular case has brought it out but the thing to remember here is that the the logic of this is is not something new this just didn't pop up after twenty sixteen and because of this particular case this is\nThis is really the really the the logic of kind of post modern liberalism goes it's this is identity politics this is what I meant by the academy comes to Washington\nIt doesn't matter whether the rule laws is upheld it doesn't matter what he's innocent until proven guilty it's all about identity politics and how he's defined in that and he's on the outside this is this is more like North Korea right he's violated the principles that deep principles of the of the party\nAnd so therefore we have to have find him guilty while the trial later maybe this is Alice in wonderland I don't know but but there's a clear this junk here that some it becomes obvious in a peculiar circumstance this is this is a\nA wonderful example of how we talk about the principles of the overarching\nIn every once in a while the circumstances just make that patently obvious\nAt ... in our Roberta in Philadelphia should Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed\nYet that I had a different perspective I'd like to tell you I attend Temple University senior program there's hundreds and hundreds of people that go every class and I go into the nearest snide remarks and the teacher and the salad students\nAnd you had a self selected audience and we call in because we care and the other people do not get this message they get their messages fan\nOr there's CNN and MSNBC ABC CBS whatever\nThat that is true absolutely but ... I I Believe and I I I Know this nearing liberals don't believe in the talk radio audience this is not pre screened we do not care of people\nAre against cabinet or they don't want to believe and so when you go out I've got no thirty plus callers it's not pre screened you can't make this I\nKnow I I think that's right I I go back to my example of of of the cab you're right I just I I think what what what is a an amazing here is that this is a moment where the\nPeople are engaged in a way they've not been a lot of things they're looking at the winds of their own background their own lives their own families and there's so much information out there ... having so quickly it's hard to filter it there's just so much and they're\nPicking up on this argument I I think that tells you something about the the general health of the American public which I think is good we're we're still divided by all means is is it a bit much divided country\nBut a lot of people who are here to four we thought were only lightly engaged not interested in politics\nOr they see this that that strikes me is a very powerful statement about the the uh the the human ... but also about the permanence and strength of the of of the American character in India and human nature about seeing something that is patently unfair and unjust\nI Will be back one more second doctor Matt Spalding maybe one or two

I had been expecting the Republican Party the stand up to what the Democrats have been doing what they did years they did\nAllow the they finally did yeah they do it for years for years they have not no no no but that's what's caused me to go out and vote because I Want the Republican Party now understand that if they do their job that they stand up for what's right I Will vote and everybody would vote\nFor the fascinating Ricardo and that's what's surprising even pollsters I've been listening to the rallies were present trip I've never heard them like this ever there are so emotional and the numbers are moving and it may be saving the Senate but the house might have an opposite effect explain when we come back within a colonel Allen West in a moment\nAnd do the exact same thing again this has to stop we have to let people know that you cannot politicized and weaponize things such as sexual assault in order to you\nKnow have political gain or political advantage to do with the end with with Brett Kavanaugh getting on to the Supreme Court this this that and and I hope that people understand that\nA couple of things you know there's ... there's a few things going on out there and one of which were going to be talking about more next week the ramifications of the midterm elections it seems in now Republicans are over the top two Republicans on the one energize how did that happen before\nIt happened very simply because you\nYou know I wrote a piece about this call the the rule of law versus the mob rule\nAnd when you look at what is happening on the on Capitol Hill where senators are being accosted you you just had Sheila Jackson Lee one of her ... got arrested because that person was putting out the personal information of Senate Republicans\nWe know what happened to ... sent me this is just intensify and now we have a a report that Planned Parenthood has come out and said that they're going after every single Senate Republican\nVotes Ah yes for Brett Kavanaugh the ACLU has come out and taking a stance against Brett Kavanaugh so now the ACLU was supposed to be about American civil liberties it's just a politicized organization so what Republicans and I said well you know Americans are seeing\nIs that you have a mob awkward to see that as taking over the United states of America and it's being led by the Democrat Party and their accomplices and the liberal progressive made it that is repulsive\nIt is in a couple of things are happening right now you had a Senator Grassley I think it's been great through this you didn't even possible spot but he's been very strong\nAnd as it as has Lindsey Graham and you know Cornyn been good too I think Republicans demeaning to shout back being shouted on I think seemed Jeff Flake just sitting there docile being yelled at you know he was kind of it's done but I think Republicans but from Cassidy\nTo a match to Grassley it started into a Lindsey Graham are starting to push back a little bit when you talk about uh being energized who didn't do a dance scene or sent on CBS this morning cut forty two\nI think he will be a I have never seen more sense drop really has been elected I've never seen more unity among Republicans will service then right now so there is a segment of the Republican electorate is either anti Trump for ambivalent about trauma\nAnd those folks for particularly suburban districts some suburban congressional districts in in certain states there's always been in a sense of lack of enthusiasm among those Republicans I Would say couldn't distinguish between Donald Trump and the Republican Party the whole thing was cancer then the whole thing was frustrating to them and they don't want anything to do with it\nFor the first time in the last ten days I think the cabinet dynamic is transform that brought all Republicans regardless of what I think the president how\nAnd Lindsey Graham said the same thing there and all I mean you didn't need convincing you don't see down Trump's perfect but you you're bored\n[laughter] well I Want to reiterate the exact same point this this is above and beyond Donald Trump this was about the rule of law the United states ... about due process is about the future of our constitutional republic and when you're up against this that we are seeing\nI mean just look at what has happened since two thousand sixteen to these antifa mobs the mobs that we see up there on Capitol Hill when you have a personal ad Maxine Waters going out and telling folks to to go after people in restaurants wherever they are people being told they have to leave restaurants being accosted in restaurants\nAmerica people see this and they see the folks that are in charge of it\nThey saw how you know senator Spartacus Booker carried on and Kamala Harris or you look at someone like Richard Blumenthal you know I'm here at Fort Sill Oklahoma with the person for true division artillery reunion with men who served in Vietnam and yet we have a personal I Richard Blumenthal sitting up there talking about honor and integrity\nWhen he lied about sort of Vietnam\nThis is what is causing people to come out and say enough\nIt is colonel is so interesting your book coming out now hold Texas hold the nation bacteria dead tree a dead three hours to ah William Travis saying that's the message he wrote well you know we're going to win a fight to the end against the Mexican army who barely out numbered them or we will die they died and were burned alive\nAnd that has them the ... but you talk about more politics you worry that taxes could or Republicans could lose taxes and in ... lose the country\nWell what I see happening is is is a repeat of what happened in Nevada and\nArizona New Mexico Colorado you see the left coming in and they take over major urban population centers and successful red states and in that clip them but what is so amazing is that people are coming to Texas which is an economically successful state because of the\nConstitutional conservative policies on taxes regulatory environment\nAnd you know they're thriving but yet they want to have the same failed economic policies and ideology\nThat day ah ran from from California will Eleanor ... New Jersey and I think that if the the left can take a state like Texas and they could competitive and they go on the thirty eight electoral votes there that does not bode well for our country\nAnd that is what you see the strategy of the progressive social is left all across the United states of America\nIs to go into major urban centers in red states\nIn places that are economics so set a successful look at Florida Andrew Gillum in Florida looking Stacey Abrams running in Georgia both of them to be governors\nTheir beliefs their principles of values are the antithesis of what has made Georgia and Florida and then also you look at Texas successful so we have to sound that clarion call\nYou well yeah and by the way the first person could be against Ted Cruz although he has got a four or five point lead over Mr O'Rourke who wisely the President Obama did not endorse that would have helped a cruise because he is not popular in Texas\nSo and on whatsoever you amber about upon further review or rock shouldn't be popular he's talented got charisma but he certainly doesn't reflect what I thought outside Austin, Texas represents a but we'll see Ted Cruz has got to step it up and maybe as a I look forward to your book it's got to be great uh and of course when did it come out\nIt comes on October sixteenth you can pre order right now on Amazon\nI go get a whole Texas hold an Asian victory or dad who tend to colonel Allen West thanks so much\nAnd thank you for your endorsement of the boat Bryant absolutes\nSo much and thank you for your indoors for the book right\nAbsolutely great when we come back we're going to be taking more of your calls one eight six six eight seven six six nine or demeaning and started a there on the Senate poor hundred strong\nNinety three nine thirty it began eastern time at ten o'clock they'll begin to welcome and maybe the ranking member center ... done a terrible speaker who usually nods off in the middle of or addresses she'll come out and say some things you can spread cabin on how bad the investigation was which we both know are not true\nAnd we know that if she wanted a big investigation she would have done told us about at once you've heard about it in July ... reiterated which he pushed it out in ... in August in states you wait until late September and she wants to believe she's a book titled how we really got her name that the last minute we had no idea\nAbout this when she had every idea about this totally disingenuous when we come back we'll give you a bringing the latest action from the poor to beat the voting starts in forty minutes actually in forty two minutes\nAnd then we'll have an answer a and a vote by about eleven am eastern time but the big story is Murkowski Blake Collins imagine all for one thing in common they claim to have not made up their mind\nWill be here when they do on the brink he'll meet ya spry and kill made [noise]\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bonded with one atom of oxygen boom you just created nitric oxide a miracle mile to your own body makes it a few your cardiovascular will help\nKeeping you vibrant but as we always your body needs help generate more natural nitric oxide super beach by human has harness the power of nutrient rich beach and created a super food\nThat helps your body make more now to ... on its own\nThe court ought to be of human is to develop heart healthy products for your body one teaspoon of super beats daily support your cardiovascular health and blood pressure levels giving you natural energy without the need of a quick caffeine kick or sugar high we're talking real healthy natural energy\nSo called eight hundred five point one twenty five fixing to go to Brian speech dot com and find out how you can get a thirty day supply of super obese and free shipping with your first purchase field but one plus one equals boom back to the super beach called eight hundred five for one twenty five Fifteen or go to Brian speeds dot com today\nAttention business owners and independent contractors loses money you're saving message from tax mediation services if your business oh twenty thousand dollars or more in taxes we can help you today right now listen\nDealing with the IRS is no picnic hits an intimidating and extremely stressful process and you don't want to go it alone our attorneys know every law every tax break and every possible opportunity to help you resolve and reduce your tax bad\nAnd if you owe more than twenty thousand dollars you may be at the top of their hit list but don't take your tax bed lightly because it will not go away on its own\nThe IRS can use your bank account your home and even shut down your business call our tax experts today I don't want to eight hundred three one eight six nine three four and a lot of deal with the IRS while you focus on your business that's one eight hundred", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "05"}
