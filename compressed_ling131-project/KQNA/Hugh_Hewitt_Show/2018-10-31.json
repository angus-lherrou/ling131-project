dressed up here I invite you to follow me on\nWatch them do I dressed up here I invite you to follow me on Instagram every day on I have showcase one of my former casting\nCall and you're like my new daughter in law okay one of those crazy people Stephanie earlier on John James and these are running for candidate for Senate and he's a West Point graduate Apache attack helicopter African American\nI played for him this clip of Eddie go out our mutual friend on your show this is what he said\nHow it works politically but I Do because it means something citizenship in this country has always been tied to free white person system naturalization act and Seventeen Ninety so when this question of immigration and your plane is with the Republican base all about a certain conception of what this\nThis idea why is it has led to eleven people being in Pittsburgh people in a Kroger and go before last so here we are after the carnage and this man this moral monster is playing to those bases All right\nNow at Seventy when I asked John James has been endorsed by Trump loves Trump is going to support Trump and as an African American what he thought about they said well we got excited it's obviously passionate and true but it's not representative of the entire African American community what do you deal with\nThat no one person's voice is representative an entire community my whether it's any or John or president shopper you or me my voice doesn't represent all women it doesn't represent our mothers' deaths represent off from New Jersey um so I I think that he can have the issue and I think the candidate you speak of Connecticut\nSo when when Eddie says moral monster which is what I'm getting too it struck me is like when Julia Ioffe said the Jake Tapper that the president had radicalized more people than ISIS and she had to stop and get in a moment to apologize I don't think Donald Trump some moral monster do you\nI struggled with Donald Trump from a moral perspective right he's the president of the United states\nAnd while he might say things that you could they have any I've said that at the dinner table you've said that at the dinner table it doesn't matter president has to hold himself to a higher scandal while you can say Seventy ... says he's the nationalist it needs a patriot\nSome things that but knowing what he divided divisive time we're living if you're the president of United States it is your obligation to raised us up on a more level and be absolutely careful and mindful of everywhere you choose\nWisely and I am saying like on a nationalist go it on a patriot go with I support ah America First are being a great American so so in terms of being a moral monster I think the president doesn't put morals first and I think he doesn't put country first\nNow okay now I don't want to put you in a corner I moral monitor though is different I really reject the president's use of enemy that people because it's just all of this term that usually was followed by a bullet through the back of the neck\nI really reject the politics of division I I I reject a lot of stuff like that these done over there but he's not a moral monster he's a controversial damage on August\n... then ... if if you don't want to if you if you don't if you care so much about the division and the divide pick any topic you don't take the topic is the president of all monster that topic capitalize on division chicken new conversation you want to talk about that I'd love to talk about that\nBut that's a that's a topic from your show that's why I picked up that's otherwise they wouldn't throw it out you know Eddie on your show\nThey know that something someone said on my show and then we moved on but if you choose to continue to capitalize on it you're capitalizing on division\nI don't I don't know if it's capitalizing if it's if it happened like the Julia Ioffe thing and it becomes obvious story coming back to it for one segment isn't capital I just wanted to know whether or not angry at that moment has\nHis has ... if he chooses to believe that the president of the moral monster he can you know what if I was an African American and I felt like the president I'm not even sure people knowledge does to people who are killed because of their race at a croaker last week\nAnd it's a purely professional question do you have an obligation as the host or say you know there are a lot of African Americans who don't agree with you Eddie when you call a memorial monster do you have that obligation\nI Do not feel like I had that obligation\nInteresting I I check the other day I'm One of my guests to who called someone or a creature and I said I checked him I said they're not quite sure if they're humans so we might get televisions different from radio I have more time to work with on a TV host says but we'll continue the conversation\nStephanie rule later today on MSNBC follower that's ruined follower Halloween

ship navy and secretary of defense Madison center in the navy Spencer dodge the question again and again when are we going to get a plan on how to get the three fifty five 'cause that's what we need\nI Know every time I've heard you say that you have\nTo remind myself to maybe get on the show and and let you know one of the reasons it's falling behind a little bit first of all nobody out there were very few see your listeners are different because they've heard it in it for me talking about they for others talking about it in terms of what did Obama due to the military\nNow idol criticized Obama for this because he is and in the heart liberals who really you know you don't wear their priorities are in is not in defending America but what we inherited from him uh we were in our army\nBrigade combat units as an example\nWe were down only thirty three percent of those could be deployed right because the problems and all of that now we rephrase that ah thirty three percent of vegetables and so we're we're in the right direction\nNow this game as a result of our authorization do end appropriation bill you got to keep in mind we did a great school getting our officers Asians grew in record\nAnd then if procreation all of a sudden we now have our little gracious though that's been a real serious problem but this anyway that's resolved that problem I remember our army aviation brigade\nThey were down to twenty five percent only twenty five percent to be deployed were up ... percent now the other area that I was still go out is the\nThe Marines used SAC and we have thirty five percent of breath eight teams could fly in and so that was the really serious problem we had\nAlong with the problem that was pointed out by the Germans they do and sees the staff and that is that were outraged and artillery in other areas\nSo so much money do\nI Know that you would like to prioritize and get started on this shift and I I think we can do that's a long range program

I just don't understand it the first female fighter pilot in the hash tag me to a era\nAnd you have are in Arizona representing a very military oriented very patriotic state which I understand is leading to a purple\nThe other thing that I find a mystery that people Florida I guess it's just such a close state Democrats or Republicans having trouble picking between Senator Bill Nelson\nWho is a of a great guy astronaut a cop Bush military got it we haven't done anything in Twenty years\nAnd you know the rich got central businessman wasn't taken a dime from the state he gave the state something like twenty million jobs he brought him into a surplus they now have a rainy day fund and you can't decide in Florida who the best candidate is\nWho's going to work harder for you for your interest in understanding what Florida wants\nI mean Governor Scott as the point where as much as he's friends with Donald Trump he separated from Donald Trump on many issues including when he gave the Spanish but one thing about Governor Scott is ratings are high with Hispanics\nBecause he earned it you want to win the Puerto Rico had the flood excuse me of the hurricane or flooded out of their homes they were relocated to Florida they did not leave a lot in the Illinois area he\nProved himself to them and their community and the Cuban community as well\nSo I just I'm I'm flabbergasted about those two races that they're even close we'll see what happens on election day we're also going to be watching what's happening in Missouri or what is happening in Nevada and what is happening in North Dakota that's a season's\nGoing to flip bread so much to discuss also says four hundred plus races in the house to a gym and we'll do all that get your call Frank killed\nSo there isn't it into the story that the and that was it that is that okay that could have been a lot longer to Bryan really I think it does yes it was Roswell or a story could have been longer lip I'm much more than that but I pay or the pecans and uncle and lays out\nThe auto sure China and China but we do have problems with China\nYour favorite topic because I like trade and China you like trade China and terrorists right a couple of things happen you know the president's doing a pretty good job on changing the subject to what he wants to change it to and getting the outrage all around I think that we're\nNow I don't know if he's really doing that I feel like we're watching these images of thousands of people trying to get in our country and he didn't calculate that he's talking about it and it's resonating with voters\nShow when you hear some of the outrage is raging about the president for example here is a Joe Biden to suit this was his campaign speech cut twenty six\nAm going to\nHave her terrorize our for all Americans for their political beliefs folks\nThis is not who we are\nWe need to recognize that words matter\nGay couple of things\nDo we do we as a country boy bronco bummer for Sandy Hook the Gabby Giffords got shot or what happened to the south Carolina church\nThose were voices of hate hateful actions so you might not like do you might not like the way the President Obama handled it or the way we are blaming guns you might not like the way President Trump handled it who tried to be diplomatic and then gets the backlash to networks just teeing off on him\nSaying he used to blame because he sets the tone of the country that ... job a body builder what job who's on Instagram singing rubber duck you in the ocean whose family said he gradually got crazier and crazier how do you blame him for that to me is is is you have to spend logic\nOh I've heard psychiatrists say that because of the direction of the leadership and the rhetoric that's being spoken\nThe U.S people that are already crazy and so then it just taking them off the deep end and they think it's more and more I'm like why they are crazy you can't you can't kill someone unless you have something wrong up here you just kept to protect someone's life\nWho would ever want to walk into a synagogue where you have innocent people eleven people and just gunned him down you don't do that this guy's crazy he's evil is evil that is what evil looks like an evil exist and this guy had with hated people just because they were Jewish\nBecause they were Jewish he ate it on and now people want to blame the president the president's\nDaughter is Jewish his uh one of his advisors and started work there his son in law works there I'm at the White House he has these beautiful grandchildren they're Jewish I just don't the president then supported them he doesn't care about that is not anti Semitic\nIt didn't stop this we\nHave a problem and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe she has a role to play and dealing with it I Would put specific responsibility on the president I think what he's done\n'em over the course of the last few years is helpful methods epicenter and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nOkay so if you listen I'm not blaming anyone other than the person who pulled the trigger and who did that that crazy guy I'm In uh in everyone's angry at him for doing this\nBut if the if the left wants to blame the president are they okay with Maxine Waters saying what she said are they okay with Eric Holder saying what he's after they okay with Hillary Clinton thing that's going to be no stability unless her party wins but they're okay with that and they don't put blame on those individuals I don't but if they're going to blame the president they've got to blame their party to\nSo ... and the New York times to these shows exactly why the president's so upset that Britain's really upset because she cannot believe he's being blamed for this got thirty for\nThe reality is that he has a ... in six days now they can be very difficult for him a heading into next year for Republicans list control of the house and I think that his feeling that pressure like\nFeeling pressure possibly but no more pressure than George Bush go when he lost the house no more pressure than Brock Obama when he lost everything the where was he was show lacked\nYeah I mean I couldn't imagine being president of the United states that the job that most people would never want because they all walk in with regular hair color and they all walk out with a gray right it's a and I would\nNot this president he will walk out with ...\nOr I might know my point as um is it is a very stressful job and you can't\nYou can't Google yourself without seeing everything just all these negative article I don't know how they survive I don't know any or to president of the United states if you Google our names outlived thing they hate us just don't do it\nBut my point is that the the less hates them so much they attack they attack they attack and what would be frustrating\nIf you believe the president the United states when he says it's fake news how frustrating would it be when you say one thing and you know your heart and you know your mind and you know what the meaning of your words are and then they construe it to mean something\nOut though in the news you know you would handle it you would say so I too am very upset about the way I've been portrayed on a different areas of the media here's what I think\nBut if you're not Donald Trump but I'm not Donald Trump Dutch where he ... he comes out and says you are the problem I'm not the problem you are the problem so then these people say well we're not at all you know not only is he not contrite\nThough that he's attacking me some ending doubled down I watched the panel last night I stay up late to do more to talk about Andrew Jackson work of neurons out in paperback ... literally\nAnd I'm watching and it's usually put on CNN the five people in the penalty all hated Donald Trump el almost as much as the host so\nWould I how does that very thing that people love about him other people hate about him and that's the fact that he's a fighter and the country I think a lot of people in middle America and that voted for him that the Trump supporters they like the fact that he fights back they might say I don't like that he says one thing or the singer called the girl that's\nBut ultimately they like how he fight back because they're tired of watching them era the with the creation of America and I think he stands for something bigger and he's a fighter\nAnd that very quality a lot of other people don't like because they don't think he's as presidential but our country got here because I think his base feels like the country was getting weaker and weaker and more global and more global and he fights for the country\nHard of a larger national offered to rejoice divides and bring people together\nThe media also has a responsibility to several times\nResponsibility to several times\nAs you stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nThem wrong with that so they could do the false attacks ridiculous you know it kills me is not a critical ... and not Don Lemon opinion people doesn't bother me at all do critical motivated by ratings will go forty percent of I picked aside\nAre you kidding me your dad victims died Andrew picked aside the governor and you picked aside grants we have audio number number two\nAre but I have no problem Sean Hannity that's his opinion that's when you that's what I'm going for a fact but when Wolf Blitzer pretends to have a new show and everything he said this Trump is bad coming up next Trump is worse\nA key here is a joke that I Would have to Troy Donald Trump\nAlmost as bad as Charlottesville as if he had said this cut twenty five\nAnd that is that child or anything of ... kind of hanging up till I adore anything that had to think kicking us and this has got to get to that\nEric Holder ... ... S C I Know they all look alike now they\nHave [noise] oh wow that's the first time I've heard that salad Hillary Clinton saying that\nWould you do the other day on the stage that was two days ago right two two days ago and she's got away with that wow I mean what do you say if Donald Trump had said that and by the way I Want to live in a world where you could say things you know she's obviously not a rain and the commentator\nSaid no they don't like I write about that yeah don't make it worse right [noise] when we come back would you be why are we just hear about that you're the only one who's reporting this Bryan we haven't reporter don't boxes and no one else who know what it means you need is going to report we fighting\nOn the plate on prime time last night really yeah how's loosely damned put on the other channels I'll tell you that wow so it's when we come back into the will of will pick her\nJob as well as far as like a a snob for the commentary 'cause she got the two are generally as her that's are tempted you and your racist or or she's just saying and I know they all look alike makes you by the way it makes the host was terrible\nAnd all of a sudden you are you trying to ruin me right right yeah like what was she when she was trying to ruin her she just trying to be funny and ... something racist\nShe tried to be funny to ever though we come back what would happen if Donald Trump said that\nBrian kill made [noise]\n\nWant to know of a truly memorable gifts to give this holiday season how about personalized any Ghraib wine bottles you do your own cost a message on photo or logo from Windsor vineyards winter vineyards is one of the top five most award winning wineries in the country the creations are starting this is the gift friends family colleagues clients will love", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "31"}
