have shown owned by the most famous man on the planet\nAnd you've been great Mike and I appreciate it very much you notice I walked over here very quickly\nFrom the relief factor dot com studio Mike [noise]\nMight get like [noise] wow what a night last night part of the battle battleground talkers\nTour a whole bunch of people coming out and being energized invigorated optimistic there's such great news right now and it feels like Republicans\nBut as we know we've got a mountain to climb on November the ... less than two weeks away Americans are going to decide whether or not\nWe're going to the um the speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi weather British she Maxine Waters in positions of leadership in the in the end on on the house side were to see if Republicans are going to lose control of this the Senate or will Republicans\nAre just lifted up by an incredible incredible amount of missteps\nAnd and and and news events that have happened in this country will will will take Republicans to another miracle finish sort of like what we felt in November of twenty sixteen welcome in too well the relief factor dot com studios we've got a real treat for you\nA few years ago I've done a lot of these traveling tours around the country and a ... a few years ago during the twenty sixteen campaign I had the chance to go\nOn a number of cities with Newt Gingrich no I'm not one of these big a\nRich famous people who travels by private jet but once in a while I get to go on one of these\nMulti city tours a on a private jet with some of my colleagues from the sale and radio network in one year in particular I got to go with Newt Gingrich from city to city I think we did fourteen cities and twelve days and I got to sit next to former house Speaker Gingrich on the plane\nFrom city to city and we would talk and he would tell stories I mean I I was just like at the need of the master listening to this political giants\nI'm a guy who has so much history and so much perspective Everytime I see him on my buddy Sean Hannity show a week nights on on Fox News channel I feel\nA little smarter a little more confident a little more gratified that I live in a country that has produced leaders like Newt Gingrich so we are very proud today to offer an hour with new we're going to spend the rest of the hour with Newt Gingrich I Want to find out\nCongressman or is now behind in his race for attorney general and frankly the guy who goes around wearing a T shirt in Spanish that says no borders are probably deserves to lose the dish and he's had so many other problems\nThat are he's ... he may Greg down the entire check it out in the Democratic party in Minnesota so a lot of this has been\nVery profound change in the nature of what we're in the middle of and I think there are historic precedence once you accept the idea that this was a period of very profound change\nAnd not only that it you know you you you you list list some of these examples of what seems to be so much\nOver the top instances of Democrats behaving badly and were seen a lotta we're seeing a kind of a mob mentality this week uh the house majority leader Kevin McCarthy his office in Bakersfield had a giant Boulder thrown through the glass\nA window we've seen Mitch McConnell and his wife harassed in restaurants I'm ... and ... and and and knew this was coming from the top you got Democrat leaders encouraging people to get in Republicans faces draw a crowd chased him out I mean the words suction unhinged time\nThat uh I got to believe this bodes well for us to November the six because a lot of Americans Republican independent maybe even Democrats are saying the only way to to stop this from continuing is to put to keep Republicans in power because if these guys are in control heaven help us\nWhile I I Do think that the uh the whole notion of jobs not mobs or in the whole notion of how the former attorney general say when they're down and check them right or I think for most Americans that's just way too much yeah and so I Do think in that sense that there's a\nSubstantial push\nUnderway uh and and I think that being if he said to me it was just really the country do you want to become a and you look at this mob coming up from Central America and there's no other way to describe it it's\nIt's just an invading force or at least seven thousand and uh somebody will suggesting last night that there is another couple of thousand coming out a lot of them all on now to join that so it may well be ten or twelve thousand before long ah and he said if you will\nYou really want to live in a world where these people believe they can come\nAnd impose on you or whatever they want\nAnd I think the Democrats are real bind\nI play a video clip yesterday um we're we're spending an hour with Newt Gingrich today on the Mike Gallagher show here in the relief factor dot com studios had a great event last night in Philadelphia ... great great crowd for our battleground talkers tour tonight I'll be in Dallas\nTalkers tour tonight I'll be in Dallas uh and then later this weekend in Chicago so we're going around the country new knows these kinds of rallies very well it's fun to be with like minded people in a room full of excited energized\nUm citizens and incidentally for ticket Chicago a Freedom Summer to go to a battleground tour dot com battleground tour dot com\nI play that clip Mr Speaker yesterday of the president in Houston proudly proclaiming that he's a nationalist\nThe crowd roared with approval and then I followed that up with a clip from Don Lemon over at CNN who was literally just mortified\nOr at the word nationalist and he kind of conflated he seemed to tie in nationalist with I'm white nationalist white supremacist because he said the word nationalism is is a national TV\nAnchor host well nationalist as racist overtones anti Semitic overtones bigotry show I guess we're now in a place with the left\nWhere if you say you believe in America is sovereignty and you believe that America is the greatest nation on earth and you want to make America First as an American you're nothing but a stone cold bigot\nThat that is the modern left the modern laughs loyalty is to some kind of vague global assume that the president's speech at the United nations was brilliant and the first really solid defense of\nAmerica as a patriotic foreign policy since the Nineteen twenties and and he drew the real distinction\nOr do you want an American government worries about America if you have this ... says the smog coming up from what I Am from from Central America\nRamming should the U.S government to decide that we want to take care of the entire planet and if that means that we bankrupt America we eliminate are free to destroy our prosperity but at least we left that Don Lemon standard of all the you know caring about the globe\nWhich is what ... what I always said that John Kerry really at the beginning of the past because\nHe was actually the global secretary of state and that's why he can continue to meet with the Iranians\nBecause he doesn't represent American policy\nAnd and the Obama administration was I think the first overtly global ... administration we've ever had and their view was that the United states was at the ... the United states was the better\nYeah but I but I have a theory too and I want to try this this out on you I don't believe Don Lemon\nOr any of these guys on the left in in the media the advocacy media is trying to stop the Trump agenda they don't believe\nThat Americans who ... who who feel the way we feel about the sovereignty of our country proudly saying you you better believe were national is they don't believe we're racists they don't believe we're big and they they don't ... that ran the semi it's just a way to chill the debate\nNo stuff and they believe you they believe all those bad things about you if you say nothing\n[laughter] just just by existing\nBy existing insistence isn't or French to them and they said this one insane fresher at Georgetown a woman who tweeted during the Kavanaugh fight\nThat all of the people who favored all the men who favor ... defending gang raped us notice that she now\nDefines who he is on her terms deserve to die and that feminists should stand watching them choked to death and then cut off their penises and feed them to hawks sort of literally a tweet from a professor at Georgetown\nWow that that is that that's that that that's the range of ...\nWhich leads people to throw a Boulder to Kevin McCarthy is office window that's been Rangel which leads people to think that they can go into a restaurant and verbally abuse the majority leader he was Senate whose wife by the way it was the secretary of transportation and she was with them for dinner that night\nWe need to understand you have a brown shirts tucked call a cherry an mentality on the left and if they can shut you and me up by calling us bad my name's they'll do it every day\nThe great Newt Gingrich Gingrich's with us here on this special edition of the Mike Gallagher show an hour with new I'm Glad

forty eight years in prison investigators are saying that cake still continues they're trying to determine if there could be more explosive devices out there\nThese guys to a person they ignored each and every one of those accomplishments hated Trump because of his tweets or his personality or his style I get that I I I I can understand a push back\nBut you but you can't do it in a vacuum and you can't do it while ignoring the things that are of impacting millions and millions of Americans these policies achievements that we as conservatives had been dreaming about for decades\nWell I think the first of all these people don't care about the evidence may have made a judgment that they have to find their life around this why are the worst thing that could happen to them for the for Trump to be a great success because\nThey are dedicated to believing that he has to fail\nAnd of course you know used but you see this I mentioned earlier earlier that when you're in great in historic periods you have these kinds of changes right when Jeff when the Jeffersonian is one of the federal is literally died out by Eighteen twelve or so or when Jackson won the anti Jacksonian hated him so much\nThat he didn't like any good biography until Nineteen forty five over a hundred years later because the the weaker aristocracy wouldn't tolerate writing nicely attraction\nA Lincoln one people feared help bitterly divisive we fought a civil war over a and and uh when FDR won he was he was described as fast man by conservatives who wouldn't even say is Nate and the Al Smith who had been the Democratic\nPresidential nominee in Nineteen twenty eight left the Democratic party in Nineteen thirty six because what is now too liberal than FDR Dennis ...\nBut he just concluded that FDR gone too far to the soil and you go through periods of this kind of change\nYou can see some people switch in the direction of the change agent and some people forming sort of a fossilized remnant and that's what the anti Trump prisoner becoming their night fossilized remnant of a group a group that used to be dynamic they now just sits in the corner and suck system and says bitter things\nAnd you know you talk about the ... that they are defined by trying to prevent his success arguably he's been an enormous success she looked twenty months into this presidency and and you see the accomplishments on the judiciary you see what's happened with the court with the Supreme Court on down\nThe economy foreign policy domestic Newt it's not it's not a stretch to say we've just seen an enormously successful twenty ... twenty month so the Trump Administration is that is that fair\nYeah look I think I think that you go down to less now getting ... if you're a liberal and this is this is where it's a little hard to understand the never Trump voters miniature a liberal having the most successful conservative judge process and history right literally in history better than Reagan but then as now are better than it's nobody's been this\nGot gotten this far as it sets a but\nIf you're conservative that's an amazing a cheap hair which actively\nAbout the economy having the lowest black unemployment in history the lowest Latino unemployment in history I mean the best overall record a sin I think fifty years\nUm those things out to be seen as pond snakes and you'd have to say at some level the slide succeeding fewer never Trump or you can't say that\nYou're not all you can't because it ruins your own your credibility that they they feel that that that would destroy their own

has been for all of us now\nHad all being said now you might say hey my president he's not running for office now he doesn't come around to another two years from now folks that is very far from the truth of it all Donald Trump is running in twenty twenty\nHe's also running here now in twenty eight team why because his agenda the one that's up to benefit us but we the people need support\nWe can hold Congress we can hold the house and the Senate\nWell\nThen the agenda that seems to be working very well for us moving as in the correct direction creating such the nominal phenomenal quarterly numbers of GDP\nGrowth there is amazing also the fact that twice as many people on average are quitting their\nJobs and then that's when he became president is amazing that means people are feeling good about the ability to get another job a better job in\nThe water\nWhy would you want to continue this [laughter] insane so obvious\nI wouldn't want to continue this [laughter] insane so obvious folks it's the lobby is and I know you're happy about it\nOr if somebody's not happy about growth and then shame on you lives if I just had a conversation with a a good man and a supporter of man is very active genes in New Jersey Jean Bennett my friend\nAh who's with fair tax organization and and and\nWe understand that are fair tax while we feel is a much better form of taxation wander the founders wanted is so much better than any other taxation methodology out there\nWe understand we're having a little bit of a issue gathering greater attraction right now in this cycle because Trump lowered corporate tax rates a little\nBit quite significantly now our tax plan gets rid of them altogether because we know that taxes corporations don't pay the right folks you know that\nYou know the corporations don't pay taxes they don't they just pass it on at the end of the day otherwise they go out of business right they need to get their numbers their quotas and that's what they do\nSo our tax thing gets rid of corporate tax rates But Trump's have lower but look what's happening since he's learned on people are getting higher wages people quitting their jobs because they can get better jobs they're getting paid more uh that means they're able to spend more it's a cyclical action\nIt's dynamic and the\nEconomy is growing so as we're having problems gathering traction we also understand that Trump has made it easier a lesser of a trans a\nTransaction uh between our tax plan and the current tax plan transition\nSo not transactions sometimes I pulled the wrong words out there and I'm a man and not to admit it so the transition between our tax plan and the current tax plan is even closer than it was before and guess what once it's really fully proven and I think it already is but one people are coming up with the numbers\nAnd seeing how the lower corporate tax rates are so helpful to our economy watch them lower McGahn what all that do\nMarlboro or jobs more corporations coming back\nBut how does he pass these things\nNeeds the house needs Congress folks so\nWhat does that mean if you want to have more money in your pockets at the end of the day\nThat
