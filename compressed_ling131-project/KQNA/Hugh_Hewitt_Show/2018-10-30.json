the rights of citizenship for babies born here from non citizen parents plus there is now a plan for the caravan what ten cities in hundreds of military signal to would\nBe illegals hopefully to stay home and apply the right way\nSo that is pretty big news and the person the United states trying to get rid of birthright citizenship but it'll be a legal fight and I'm sure there are people who get

figuring out how many people thousands and thousands of people on the bridge when you looked at that age range loaded up with maple that's called an invasion of our country\nAnd there's ... up to seven thousand there that they make their way into will probably be McAllen, Texas lieutenant colonel Allen West in taxes his book is now out it's called whole Texas hold the nation victory or death or go can turn a lieutenant colonel Allen West welcome back\nIt was going to be with you Brian how are you today\nIt was going to be with you Brian how are you\nSo colonel five thousand two hundred troops going to the border you you in the military for decades you can't really do much right you gotta support the border guard\n[laughter] yeah that's the same because of ... you cannot\nYou know the federal troops in our military are not allowed to do any of domestic law enforcement operations that's what this would end up being a you can see this as much as it was still a our military does not have that a jurisdiction and you have the border patrol to do this and that's why I think we need to make sure that our border\nPatrol or properly equipped to handle these type of situation and the good thing I think the president has articulated this before and also a homeland security secretary Nielsen is that we want to bring these troops and so that they can be the backstop\nThey can provide more the logistical support that is necessary so that you can get more border patrol agents into what I call the penetration so\nNow they're saying that is so important to understand and realize Brian is that\nUh we need to be looking at the other avenues of approach that the drug cartels or other use along our border\nBecause if we you know send a lot of resources to this Mike Allen sector publish things are going to happen elsewhere or drugs will probably try to flow through\nA more weapons that phase of this nature so we need to make sure we do have a good coverage along the border and maybe that's another way that we could use the military to supplement with some of the intelligence gathering of surveillance a resource the platforms they have\nThe hope is deterrent as the word spread that central and south Americans are being favorite Mexican stay home they got the message only two percent of the people crossing the Mexican maybe the word is Donald Trump is serious there's five thousand troops we have no hope only a tent so the deterrent has to get down there\nWell I think one of the announcement is a that shouldn't be may right now because when you look at that as a flow of individuals' it reminds me a lot of low that you saw going into Germany there's an incredible preponderance of single military age males that's why I refer to it as an end in a in the military\nUh you know these are you know Fifteen to thirty five year olds are unaccompanied males you know I think we should say immediately that they will not be allowed ... to the United states of America\nAnd and we need to say here here the type of people that we would even consider or to to have these asylum interviews with\nA and and they have to be family units or there or you know children that are you know by themselves below the age of Thirteen you know we will consider them but if you're a single military age males you know we're basically going to take you to the closest military base put you on the one third as the Seventeen\nWill fly right back to find the the the nearest airfield that we can laugh at you and and uh you you can figure it out\nWhy you you were President Obama said and it just choose outlined exactly why I think he's an ineffective added touch president cut ten they're\nMiles and miles away\n\nSo easily ... to it or a greater degree at a different appearance he thinks it's freedom malnourished or illegal immigrant you have to point\nWell obviously has not been watching I mean the folks that didn't say it along the way but\nThen again he was the same person that locked up President Trump was his plan to bring manufacturing jobs are production back to the United states of America restore our economy but\nNow he said he wants to take credit for that so President Obama's out of touch him when you listen to that clip you just play it seems likely a delusional person that will stand I'm writing it could get his thoughts together this is a very serious thing where people want to breach you or your border\nWhen people believe that they have a right to enter your country because they want a better job that's not the whole purpose of having a solver border\nThat's not the purpose of having a ... like the United states of America we want you to come here but there was a front door there is a legal immigration process\nA with a lieutenant colonel Allen West his book is now out whole Texas told the nation I got to ask you about taxes take cruises lead it down to five points fifty one forty six over Beto O'Rourke that's a Quinnipiac poll kind of reliable Fox subscribes to it is it that close\n[laughter] you know ... of course when I'm Out and about now say some of the early ... I see a little bit of a parity between a Republicans and Democrats and I live in a blue county here in Dallas the Dallas County\nYeah there was an enthusiasm that the other side lost and then also you have to take into account that Greg Abbott is the top of the ticket the governor very popular governor he's\nUp there about twenty twenty two point lead I think that's something that we should look at it as far as Ted Cruz a gone\nAlong those coat tails but you know you can never tell Donald Trump was supposedly got blown away by by Hillary Clinton look what happened on all the lectures that I'd say Ted Cruz will pull it out I Believe that he will win somewhere between seven to to not going to be a lot closer\nThan people want it to be but I think that there was a very good marketing job of a representative overworked\nBut his message just not right for taxes\nHe is but you write for our show colonel Allen West go pick up his book cold Texas hold the nation victory or death colonel thanks again\nCause applies to take care of her on the\nYou got it uh when we come back Doug we'd presidential story in New York Times best seller confidence to the Bush it was a real perspective on Andrew Jackson had the president and what other presidents saw in him that they found so attractive even if this generation doesn't try and kill me Joe do move everybody thanks so much for listening\n\nYeah that's right and actually I was the first to write about the comparison between Donald Trump and Andrew Jackson talk about the New York times picked it up after I did so and after that happened of course manner than many others talk about it but\nBoth men were outsiders but both men were considered too politically experience to the effect of president both men were populist standing up for the forgotten man\nBoth of them were wealthy while publicly taking on the establishment of money interest Andrew Jackson opposing the second national bank for example both men had short tempers and more predictable Jackson carry forward citizen bodies from personal do\nBoth mental and against family dynasty Jackson took on the John Quincy Adams whose father than President Trump took on Hillary Clinton whose husband had been president I can just go on and on it both mental ward against their own political parties\nAre both men and after winning the election as we tally aided by appointing businessmen and the soldiers\nThe government government positions instead of politician it just I Can't even comparison\nAnd by the way a well obviously Ronald Reagan got shot and they tried to shoot Andrew Jackson twice a one time the gun did not go off it got wet and he ended up being the guy with a cane right\n[laughter] yeah he actually died with bullet still in the body including one large near as hard that they were never able to operated on a because it was considered so dangerous uh\nThe Jackson within a dual with an opponent and who is considered to be a perfect shot and everyone said he's gone or and so Jackson they marched out they turn and Jackson didn't shoot his opponent shot and they thought how cool objects and you just kinda went there and\nAnd he must have missed and this guy was a perfect shot and then Jackson cooling lowered its pedestal Ayn\nAnd killed the man after it was over they found out he hadn't missed perfect shot\nHad actually shot Jackson and that was the bullet near his heart but he had survived so very dramatic very interesting people both of them\nYeah I just love the Andrew Jackson philosophy is is pretty cool and his mom gave it to him she said this to make friends by being honest keep them by being steadfast never tell a lie or take what is not your own newer soup for slander settle for causing cases yourself he did that his entire life\nShe died when he was fourteen but he held onto that\nThat's true that's true and that I'm a you know I Love your book by the way Bryon comical life in your book there were differences between Trump and Jackson Trump was born into riches Jackson into poverty\nTrump came from a large family Jackson's father died before he was born\nAnd as you point out his mother died when he was young though\nSome say that he ... in his whole life with all the bullet cooked in chances he took his life that he was the journey back into his mother's arms because his mother left him as a child to ten and a wounded soldiers in the revolutionary war\nAnd he wanted to being worthy of being wounded and worthy of his mother's love and attention and the theory that so but what\nFascinating story you wrote and you make can come alive in your book\nYeah so I thank you very much coming from you do agree that means a lot I Love this line that they don't want to ask you about the whole war on history he says this in his farewell address after his eighth year\nI thank God that my life has been spent to the land of Liberty City has given me a hard to love my country with the effects of his son his son to his country a father\nTo his people the guy wasn't sitting there in English class hanging out with Mark Twain thought that was coming from the God he was self taught myself to a lawyer judge congressmen two term President Bush in general\nAnd lastly Doug do you worry about this ... movement to take the take generals and leaders and Americans and print it off their pet is still because we're judging them on values that we have today\nYeah it's really a remarkable you know\nWashington D. C. would have to be changed Washington had slaves uh Columbus had slaves there so the mayor of New York wanting to change Columbus Circle\nWell Washington district of Columbia you'd have to change that the white I think our of all people who was the first pioneer and civil rights the truth\nAnd the Little Rock to uh protect those young African American children going to school he had a portrait of Robert ... leave a one of the on the wall of the oval office because believe me I work hard to help a young black played get out of slavery and\nHad it ended up bringing his own way than to try to bring a reconciliation after the civil war between the north the south and we\nCan judge Abraham Lincoln who at several million the slaves in bondage after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation watching hadn't taken those first steps towards liberty a ... we ... we wouldn't have to have\nA the freedom but that young African Americans have today could be able to be successful and to have their dreams come true so we have to credit but really that that were taken\nHe is I dug we'd I could listen to them forever that's why you got to read his books New York times best selling author noted historian served under presidents or and or the Bush White House dog can't take enough\nThank you Brian you've written a great book here I Hope everybody gets a chance to read it\nThanks so much Doug Reed thanks to the brain kill me Joe don't move\nGiving you everything you need to know\n\nIf you're like most of us you have a balance in your credit card in higher interest rate than you would like why not turn those balances into one monthly payment at a lower fixed interest rate and start saving money and ice cream offers credit card consolidation loans\nFrom six point one four percent a PR with auto pay you to get a loan for I don't know five thousand two hundred thousand dollars you can even get your fund as soon as today you apply why streams really cool it believes it people with good credit deserve a great interest rate would know fees can you imagine that my listeners out can save even more with an additional\nNew fees can you imagine that my listeners out can save even more with an additional interest rate did count on top of ice creams already low rates the only way to get this didn't count as you go to light streamed dot com slash kill me to\nThat light stream L.
