that wonderful introduction\nAbsolutely no you were running for a seat on the central Arizona water conservative a conservation district uh [laughter]\nThat's maybe one of the longest titles and one of the most important races that does not get recognition to my mind please explain to people first of all your website where they can find your position on things and secondly getting into that position was so important and were used in on it\n[noise] oh alec thank you I guess I Am running for one of five states from Maricopa County Arizona project actually consists of a team member board SPA WC date and\nWhat we have right now are five open spots and\nThis is critical this is what actually controls the water supply first date a\nFor central and southern Arizona it's very important that we have the right people went the ripe priority is running and winning I'm I'm\nRunning with a two other individuals I'm from the west valley and so it's very important to our agricultural\nBase are farmers or ranchers are veterans says our school that we have the right people otherwise water rates may actually double a this time around but this board a ... in place there is a big struggle going on I'm running\n... ram once before\nAnd and golf courses and water policy and I'm also running but they propane or who is an engineer from the east valley so they're in the east valley I'm nowhere\nAnd together I think we make the loan amazing pain [noise] um at least three of us out of the five spot\n[laughter] and we have no no no no you need I Need to share yeah what's the website That's what I'm getting to people need to know 'cause I Want to learn exactly what you are all about so they can go there they can\nSupport you and they can share your name with their friends because folks along main but all you need to do is when you look on the ballot you need to look for the first name Terry T. E.\nR. or why trust me on that I Know her very well so I'm sure the website police carry\nYes I'm In my last time I ... and although it's an Italian name I make a joke and I say go to your ethnic Gobi Desert and that might help everyone remember\nGosh it's that lady yeah the number one thing we need in any desert weather\nWhole state which which without water we won't be here but\nA is water so number one resource first date lessons pardon issue actually I Believe on the ballot um and uh\nWe have a couple of website um you can go ahead and uncle central Arizona\nNames and job a painter\nAs well as we're on Facebook under the ace W they can get that and\nSo that will help you right now we're renting again it's a nonpartisan position we happen to be and I don't mind saying this because I think people do need to call and we are\nGoing to be the conservatives which it's actually a good thing the conservatives are going to look out for 'em and our water supply we have been a drought for over a Nineteen years in our state fortunately this\nHad some rain which which that's helping and I\nHas been over a Nineteen year drought so any drought contingency plan for our state um for Maricopa County especially and for growing population we have to ... um lake Lake Mead and Lake Powell that\nFeed into each other and they are\nAlarming laying low right this is an issue that has just been kicked around like a like a soccer ball I'm On this particular central Arizona project board without any real plans in place so should we were huge um a\nAlarming level okay work out three hundred feet I Know one of the lakes [noise] especially when you reach a\nAn alarming level than a fan of one half the right plan and strategy and plane everybody overnight is going to have a a a crisis situation and no one is prepared and the most important thing\nAbout any crisis situation that is potential uh you know situation for escape ... can be prepared and we need people who are preparing and so I think everyone's kinda blindly trusting who currently serving on this board\nAnd I can tell you it is it is calling us in a direction that is not preparing that's as fully as we could be\nAnd that's why I'm so grateful that you're running because as I talk about character ... you know that Kerry is one of the hardest workers but ever witnessed in regards to actually planning things out and then executed one she's ready\nNo which taking you are a little bit of a while to run for office because I've heard you being asked to run multiple times who was three or four years we've been out and about but you said it has to make sense you know I Know there's always family involved I Know there's always\nYou know you want to run for the right position and not just run to run so I Am so grateful that we have somebody that is great with working with\nProven steak so in other words you're the first to say you did something is marked on record cannot be raised if anybody comes later and says that they did it all you have to do is go back to your ... steak where you claim to major claim put your stake in the ground and it's there cannot be removed\nThat anyway my question today that and I walked up to him after\nThe after the event and they said David I haven't had a question for you and years and he's like I Know\n[noise] so we chatted him I asked him because him and a group ... works with a committee they sent a letter to the SEC the other week and they asked\nWhen please give us some guidance in regards to the exchanges with digital currencies\nNow this is important because we have people like the the Winkle last twins and other legitimate groups that want to have crypto exchanges\nBut they're not being allowed to because\nThey're not giving guidance to Congress to say what is this is a monetary as it is it is it is a property many IRS is dean boat so uh they're waiting for him to get back but I asked ... and I know he supports it iced I suggested hey\nI'm why not have a Congress\nOr if if the FCC will not rule creative statutory law\nWhereas it will be recognized so I was just planning to see but I have a feeling already that they might be ahead of me on that\n... is a very smart man especially when it comes in the numbers and he gets the importance of block chain I fully believe that so uh that's my endorsement of David Schweikert I Would suggest you get out there and vote for him in this twenty Eighteen election cycle\nGet out there are strong and vote for him because I Want to make sure that nobody thinks that they can take\nCD six and try to turn blue anyway we're going to go to break to we'll be right back [noise]\nStay tuned for more with Allen [noise]\nYeah and a brand new studio located in beautiful Scottsdale, Arizona branch of the

office to ensure the sign onto the contract once elected will make sure\nThey were feeling that promising gamble share that information when you add gab God man\nGo there today and see how you know\nYou weren't listening to the Alex Milan\nOn everybody welcome back to the show I ... so gravely you stay tuned we've had a great show today so far what going on this week in Arizona a lot going on in one thing that I have spoken about on my show is many of the propositions that are\nGoing on here\nA few weeks ago a couple of weeks ago we had Andrew Clark with of Americans for prosperity on and we were talking about proposition one twenty six where we need you to vote no\nBarely touched on started to touch on proposition one twenty seven\nI'm just what is another no [laughter]\nAnd I want Andrew to come back on and tell you all down and so I guess one he's here Andrew thank you for joining us again\nUm\nI Know a little bit more about one twenty seven then one twenty six and but but since I think you know even more than I Do and I hope you do but it's real basic clothes it's really basic the bottom line is\nEven one twenty seven it was a good idea meaning that it was really going to help us out in some way shape or form a we we couldn't afford it for one into it is just going to make things worse since\nIt's got to be the most the craziest bill that I think I've seen out there where it's going to cost the taxpayers more money and for people are saying it's going to help\nThe environment it's going to harm the environment and I want you to explain to people\nWhy this is just a ... out now live by the people that are supportive as crazy proposition but explain the proposition and then explain why they were just so out in left field on us\nSo that's kind of hard to get him on science argument with what you want an alternative and\nWhat the companies here to the power of that happening for solar\nPanels all solar and wind around all the outlaws harder on nuclear classified as a fan of our power provided by solar sovereign you were talking about solar and\nIs that the utility companies adopt and\nThey want to make money off of it was true at all\nAnd talk about why and talk about why it's bad philosophical I used to cost ... ... talk about\nYour system is just the way it anyways and why this course star wherever you want\nWell ah for for woman I'd like to do is I'd like to talk about what it'll do to the nuclear power plant which by the way folks is the safest energy we have out there we haven't built a nuclear power plant in the United states and the\nI guess late seventies it was early ins but it's been about Thirty years or so ... almost ... it's it's it's insane to me because it's been proven to be the safest energy source that we have out there and folks solar is not there yet do I do I have a problem with the idea of\nEnergy no not at all but when technology\nI have a problem with the idea of solar energy no not at all but when technologies not there\nAnd when they're going to try to shut down perfectly safe perfectly well working facilities where thousands of people are employed where millions of dollars I think it's over sixty million dollars a year we get for classrooms\nFrom these these these energy sources even trying to shut them down and then create solar power in order to do this you will have to create what was it they said they are degrading your Andrew I Believe the green at least two factories which are going to be coal burning or fuel burning in order to create the solar right\nYep I mean\nWhat kind of wanting a part of that technology in the offing rapidly and they're not even sure what kind of technology they want to use on this and so you like that right now the largest solar plant this solar plant called salon and\nIt is a natural gas to fire up the molten salt they use to capture me solar energy west not carbon neutral like they\nWell what'd you think they'd be able to make it self sufficient sufficient noise [laughter] they'd be able to use solar power up their uh their energy that that just tells you right there it's not as effective again the idea of solar is great but when it's causing more to create more is creating more damage to our ecology\nThen it's actually helping is your ... ridiculous and here's the thing\nThey said the fifty percent number that's the big issue folks\nI don't mind that we move toward solar in some ways as long as it's affordable safe and it it's a free market is you know growth for a game for for for everybody out of the citizens\nAnd or the companies that are doing I mean why would you do it why would you create something what would you put it out on the free market in months it was something was going to make money well unless you're subsidized\nUm this is what's going on they're looking to subsidize one industry over another and it's an estimate it's an estimate and this is the argument I've been hearing out there they're saying oh how can you say it's going to cost us an actress Nineteen\nHundred dollars that's just the number he pulled out of nowhere no that's a number where they've actually taken everything into consideration and it's an estimate that it probably would based upon current growth\nCurve numbers Kurt electric bill and what's going to get shut down what's not going to get shut down who's going to lose jobs blah blah blah and the costs that are associated with it you on average if you vote yes on prop one twenty seven\nWill have to spend an extra Nineteen hundred dollars a year on your on your bills on your electricity so\nThat's just one way you wondering is you'd be saying no but do you care care\nAbout the ecology didn't care about your wallet and the air you breathe\nYou want to vote no\nSimple as that I don't put this one into a really good story\nLine as well as I Do many other my or other problems that I talk about here Andrew and I think the reason is because it's just it's a double hit of just insanity that they want to pass this I mean it's it's a very simple you know", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "20"}
