[noise] well\nThere's a reason I have a new council now and I'm looking at all options to fight those are really as I saw it on a TV earlier with you I just want to make sure that what happened to me never again happens to any American and if I'm going to fight those it's not just for myself it's for any American citizen who might be targeted lawfully lawfully by our own government\nSo you're looking to possibly overturned that play up to get back up slowly you that's a risk with that\nThere is a risk but you know what it's a it's a it's a worthy of risk because um my reputations on the line I think the integrity of the entire investigations on the line and sometimes you have to think of the greater good and not just yourself what would you interact with the Mueller probe like um I I really can't get into too many details about my exact interactions with them but I'm Glad like Saddam look in the fight those right now so\nAh the the ... going to come out with a whole bunch of indictments evidently after the midterm elections if it's based on George Papadopoulos and they build from there what's your message to the Mueller probe um I have\nAbsolutely no idea who they are looking at or what they might be doing all I can do speak for myself and the um if ... as I said it earlier I was targeted by western intelligence there was absolutely no reason I should have been prosecuted here is a Mark Meadows cook thirty for\nWhat's troubling for me is today a there is even a greater confirmation in my mind a bit there was inappropriate behavior on behalf\nOf the FBI and the OJ as they initiated this investigation is a continued with the investigation and as they continue to not give information to a whether it's Mr Papadopoulos there's council or the American people are Congress\nBecause you have to put this together on your oh they're not giving you information about you a ... plug if it wasn't for the great\nWork of a certain reporters I to this day I don't think anyone in this country let alone me or any council mine would have known that there was this exculpatory evidence\nAnd you see a very interesting to ditch myth said at the helper a downer or the one thing in common they all do like President Trump and from ... myth said worked it seems with Christopher Steele to on earth to corruption with the world cup\nAnd that's how that's how Christopher Steele got the trust of the FBI and now they're working together to get you and Donald Trump it's insane\nI mean it's absolutely crazy how what I wandered into and I'm just surprised a you know I wasn't looking at a lot worse charges because probably my my I got was right on about a lot of these meetings\nGeorgia I really love that you came in here sorry you had to go through that will talk to you again soon dogs on march ... thanks so much\nTo the GDP and when was it four point to last quarter and a half three point five to two very good numbers\nAnd now you have the tax cuts and the original premise was hey are Republicans running the tax cuts and new one is looking at this caravan ... immigration and this is what we're talking about and it's not a ... it's not a what if it is it's happening the Republicans running on the right thing\n[noise] well look this election is all about Donald Trump just like a Michael Steele was suggesting maybe not the way he was interpreting it but a Trump is placed himself at the center of this election he was going to be the center anyway Democrats would've made in the center of it if he had made in the center of it\nAnd most votes are going to be cast in reference to him that's not to say that issues don't play a big part they do for Republicans\nOr immigration has been at the top of the list for three years and that's why the caravan you'll hear people say the Democrats funded the care of it I have to laugh it should be Republicans funded the care of that 'cause it's helping candidates\nIt's splitting immigration front and center right at the critical moment of the campaign the final days of a campaign\nSo Kavanaugh the caravan er and Trump himself that is that's what's driving the Republican side and to some degree the Democratic side\nWhich drew down on this is what Democrats have been saying some current trouble exists in the majority of non white districts were Democrats worry about turning out the Hispanic vote they have largely given up hope of an seeding will hurt you know who goes again as president on the wall and other things in these uh CIA guy remarkably competent and diverse\nBut and and and another uh now into a over also in California\nSo what's going on for your numbers tell you about the Hispanic vote in America\nWell there's great concern I Know on the Democratic side about getting a good turnout because they didn't get it and twenty six team I mean it was Hispanics African Americans and millennials\nWho did not turn out at anywhere close to the ... they were expected to win a course that made the difference so they've detected relatively low interest among Hispanics in the mid term election and and normally frankly\nUh minorities and millennials don't participate in mid term so that's kind of a built in structural advantage for the Republicans [noise] uh so you know you've always got accepted as you mentioned will hurt what parties need to do and they have done to a certain degree is to allow the district to dictate the nominee\nAnd in the case of will heard that's a moderate district relatively speaking up close competitive monitor district and will hurt has played that correctly he's he has used the issues that help him in avoided the issues that hurt him and that's why he's the favorite\nThat makes sense and by the way we need people like this who are going to you'd have the lucrative security careers you got a chance to know I'm a little bit but they go back in the service where it's pay okay but you go to places on a regular basis\nYou're not you it's truly service and for Republicans to criticize will hurt him thinking to myself what do you want in a candidate they all can't be speaking from the same him sheet and then you are not serving the country do you agree Dr ... well\nYeah and also you can actually get a majority if you insist on that you can't have everybody looking and sounding exactly alike this is a very diverse country\nAnd so you have to adjust the nominee to the district and and really vice versa during gerrymandering but and you're right look people think that Congress Miller very well off and so and it's all of them are some of them are very wealthy before they come in\nBut for relatively average people of modest means and they're quite a few of them in Congress it's a struggle to a woman a household in DC and another household at home because frankly Brian not everybody makes you kind of money\nRight uh exactly you know ... see I'm not even close not even close brown and you know how to get close to ... yeah well\nWe're not he's probably doing just a little bit better so he owes you\nRight now I'd put it this way my helicopter is not a new when he gets a new helicopters leases them online I I bought an old one and I refurbish\n... for me I insist on a new job every year to contract\nAll right so that he said that movie we've transportation for just a second and again I blame you for getting us off track and tape that I'm a hundred percent correct\nPeter promised means go cut that part out who will never have a record of who is Peter I got to meet him he's yeah he's he's one of your of hundreds of assistance exact back they're running something machine\nTom for as friends the DNC tell me if he's playing a game or is he really worried\nWe will look at their action and we've got to be close I I don't ... I I always talk about the name for the blocking and tackling I Know a lot of\nPeople talk about this blue wave and all that so I don't believe I happen to think\nI don't know election night you're going to find a very very close situation in a maybe a handful of votes determining whether Democrats\nOr gain control of the house\nAnd so are they just plain down expectations Bernie Sanders and Tom braid upper as well we're just a pushing aside the blue wave trying to motivate people\nIn a while it's both really I mean basically they're saying ah I'm having flashbacks twenty sixteen I'm afraid\nThe other half of it is a they have to insist that the election is very very close to get there are people out because many Democrats aren't used to participating in midterms so it's it's a bit of both\nUh in the middle of the night there having the twenty sixteen flashbacks during the day they're trying to motivate the Democratic party constituencies\nIt's hard to comment on breaking news but we found another package on this one to James Clapper in New York City when I started the show walking upstairs they found they looked like another packages heading to Cory Booker\nI Do hear that they're close to an arrest by does so far that it's not the packages were seemed to have been put in a put in place some point this week when you look at this and we hope no one's heard me seemed to be a bomb making material but no there's no neither there and know blasting cap thankfully\nThought having said that who does this play more for the the Democrats who say that the president's language is causing this or the Republicans who are security a party\nI Want to see who it is and maybe it's a person\nErnie I Want to see who it is and maybe it's a person maybe it's a person's you gave me some good news I hadn't realized they were close to an arrest I'm thrilled to hear that\nBecause this is intolerable it God Knows I Hope that one hundred percent or maybe Ninety nine percent knowing knowing our country as we do Ninety nine percent would agree this is absolutely unacceptable this goes way beyond the bounds of of anybody's definition of a discourse in politics\nSo let's find out who did it let's find out what the motives were then we can assess the damage if there is any maybe there won't be any effect at all politically but we have to know who it is and what the motives were\nSo how can a president and I asked this question yesterday without creating a great answer to all the pressures on you a president who had three uh three hit books on it from ... to Michael Wolff to Bob\nWoodward he had an anonymous staffer write an editorial talking about how incompetent tea and he's had multiple people like Tillerson and reportedly Kelly basically Komen idiot\nBut yet he is now at forty seven percent of the wall Street Journal NBC and forty four percent according to CNN approval that just about just above President Obama\nHow did that and now he's ... and now he's trying to nationalize this election and making about himself I Know we have to rewrite and rethink everything and the Donald Trump era but can you make sense of that\nSure he made that connection with his people the people the forty six percent who voted for him that has endured of course you also have to say he made a connection with the people who didn't vote for and then there's also endured\nPeople made up their minds about Donald Trump a long time ago this additional information you just mentioned the up much of it it makes no difference if you're a for a mere really for him if he were against him you're really against him I've yet to meet anybody in the middle\nYou do me um you polled them I mean independents are undecideds you've demoted there they\nKnow but they're they've already made up their minds about Donald Trump they may not have made up their minds about who they're going to vote for in this midterm election because after all while Donald Trump is is center stage there are other people on the stage I mean the candidates matter their issues matter the ah the states and Mr Ricks matter so\nUh you once again you're over generalizing Brian and I guess this is leading back to another discussion another plug for your book\nNo I think that you are becoming more belligerent than Chris Wallace on the show and I didn't think that was possible this is really a lizard as Chris allotted share well I'll tell you I really didn't give me a run for the money they hitch a damn getting really hurting my self esteem I don't know if how the confidence to have a good weekend we'll\nGive it over to your staff let them have turned up like I'd like to see how they do\nBut you know I I don't if I knew who they were it would definitely how am I right now if you look at your\nCrystal ball how how many seats are sure how many are up for grabs in the house well\nWe don't have either party over to Eighteen we've been very very cautious and\nThat means the remaining tossup as we think twenty twenty two remaining toss ups that's where the election will be decided I don't see a suit me I don't see a big blue wave I've said that for a long time I've been very consistent", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hugh Hewitt Show", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "26"}
