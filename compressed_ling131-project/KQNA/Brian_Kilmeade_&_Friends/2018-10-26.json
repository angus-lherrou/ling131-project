library\nWere also a streaming and I also do the Facebook Live some part during uh during talks in France So a lot of people comment on that out so maybe you can get some comments up but let's go out to Scott listening on Facebook or watching it on Facebook he's got\nA Brian how you doing good what's your name on\nA ... minute we are in a Desert Storm warns that I Am black I Am a conservative than I Am a national or just like President Trump because I Believe in marriage is first and I don't understand why the Democrats don't they say why\nThey're there to serve the public that there are served this country\nBut yet they create chaos confusion and the part they fight to merge it could have done if he had their support or anything\n[noise] I I agree I mean that's all\nI'm going to be just to push back a little bit I Love doing the president brought those cameras in and go cheated on camera especially when it came to guns then we came to immigration\nAnd I would not have minded and a lot of people are gonna be mad at me but I Would not have minded if the president got a twenty five billion for the wall and exchange forgiving the DACA or the DACA kids now young adults a ten year path to citizenship\nI Would not mind did that because then you go back and you realize the chain and lottery or something even Democrats aren't very they aren't necessarily against blue to win the beginning of possibly\nA cascade of deals now I'm being optimistic but they said the Democrats they feared he was going to do with infrastructure why\nBecause that would have made them play ball\nInstead it was his fourth or fifth thing and they said well you know I we we as we don't like what he's doing you know with his tax plan and everything else so we're not going to participate Scott if you get old house and Senate I think they're going to get stuff done I think they're going to get stuff done if they could hold out and set up by anymore do you\nThink so too I think so too I mean this the first time since\nI guess since Reagan that I'd been optimistic about America and the benefits of America is that like the week you know the president is doing that he's a man that that in there were just bizarre to do right and he put a lot\nWhen I say he has this market charities she didn't hurt is equal to hear a lot of that you do this and what people being able to grow in their own special one\nHeat and you really want to be doing we built this world in so many different ways\nGreek we should not sell our sovereignty to anyone because you're ... your book about Andrew jak yeah even though I agree with a lot of ... was about when it came to cross all my life but I Love the way he attacked or ... I Love to eat right and that\nThis has got the thing is he was about America and there's no question about that he was not for his fame and acclaim back in a moment tax great call\nRight I mean you know somebody that I talked to off the record who is also very deep into the kind that investigation is not this one in particular\nIs also very deep into the kinds of investigations not this one in particular said you didn't have to really look at this at their you know the people who are examining\nThe bomb techs and the specialists through the FBI they know almost immediately whether something is a viable device or not and lessen the authorities in New York has said these are not hoaxes these are potentially viable devices um but not one has gone off and apparently none\nOf the packaging the way that normally\nThey would expect something like this to be done if they actually want to hurt or killed people is it the packages booby trapped to go off when you open it they said that wasn't part of it either so he's adjust to strictly in the work quote terrorizing me to instill terror and people to frighten people\nOr is it actually about harming people I mean these are two very very different objectives and I think they know a lot more about that then they're saying at this point\nYou're talking to China Bremer by the way is also an attorney handles or legal stuff here not my personal stuff you will notarized anything and that bothers me\nThey won't pay hundreds stance are free\nDon't you feel bad uh charging as a notary\nI don't I don't know that I Need that four dollars and it makes a difference for me how you want your document I'm going to need a four dollar\nDoes fun so a lot of people are saying the president should have taken a more conciliatory tone a stump speech when he said he's fighting back and he's saying listen maybe if you weren't ripping mean Ninety two percent of the time of going to stab CNN and MSNBC it wouldn't create so much a usual Rush Limbaugh said cooked Fifteen\nBecause they're not they are trying to pass responsibility and there's lots of Donald Trump and trying to get up to shut up\nIn response and in opposition to we're supposed to sit here and so I don't know until we know the facts we can't comment while they comment left and right and start ragged on Trump for his supporters or what have your while we're supposed to sit here and be polite and have good manners and not say anything about it\nAnd the that for the most part I Am stunned I thought on the Sunday show to get a lot of opinion and talking about President Trump's tone and Maxine Waters and the horrible comments Eric Holder said we're going to kick 'em and\n... you know this was happening hours after the packages were found Shannon uh-huh so you're going to get worse until we find the guy\nIt's interesting because died Benson a vote apiece in town all yesterday and he pointed to some um [noise] video of Nancy Pelosi after the shooting that nearly killed these ... and she was in a press conference and it it must have been within a day or two after this had happened to shooting it happened and she asked about those who are trying to link\nIs to potentially someone on the left or somebody who was upset by the Democrats which we now know exactly\nHow that played out and her comments word this is outrageous how dare dare you go there this is disgusting this was a terrible event how dare you make any links between political ideology or try to blame this on anyone\nBut for the president for the White House they feel like that's exactly what's happening to them by now I mean we had a guest on last night um who was the deputy chair of the DNC or vice chair\nAnd Michael I'm Blake and she started immediately saying with the president bear some responsibility to that and I said wait a minute what exactly are you saying I mean the person who put these devices together and mailed them and put them into the strain to try it frightened people or wherever the objective was\nThat's the person who's responsible for this and he wanted to have it both ways that they don't put words in my mouth I'm not saying the president actually did this I think what you're saying is the president bears some responsibility for that and you have to be very clear about that because\nYou know in those conversations in the weeks a after ... was almost killed there were a lot of folks who are objecting and saying it's not fair to tide us to a particular party and the truth as it is the individual who pulled the trigger or makes device that is ultimately the person that is very troubled and how the problem and they're the one\nUh left or right or center or if they're just disturbed in some way they're the ones who's made who have made this decision to um put these things in a place\nI Want to be a ... that's a big topic or the other topic of course the midterms and the caravan but I Want to bring it to the Robert ... and he goes on radio and TV we had George Papadopoulos a member of the twenty eight now thirty one year old who is a unpaid foreign policy advisor who pled guilty to lying to the FBI\nNow he's starting to put his whole series of events together and he believes the deal Jay and the FBI along with three separate countries combined to set him up because they didn't want to be president only did become president they wanted to hurt him\nAnd he uses evidence of actor John ... of his original contact his original contact in England as a molten professor and now we find out about working for British Intelligence and then we find out to the ambassador down or Evans says Clinton ties also supposed to be linked to a trillion and British Intelligence\nAnd now we also find out this stuff and how for an American who worked for the FBI all targeted him\nWhile he sat in house arrest in Chicago apartment watching all this money go out the window he wants to know over a overturn a overturned his conviction and his plea here's what Mark Meadows said after going after hearing what he had to say behind closed doors yesterday and the committee hearing cook thirty two\nI can tell you that I Am very trouble than his Fourth Amendment rights may have been violated and it the way that this was conducted was certainly inappropriate and not what we would believe to be standard protocol for the FBI\nDidn't like it and he went on cut thirty three\nYou know listen I have if he testifies publicly based on what we just heard today uh I think the American people would would side with George Papadopoulos uh uh regardless of party or when you hear it and and yet I don't I don't see a public hearing happening just to be Frank\nNot happening but he was pretty moved by what he heard behind closed doors what are you hearing 'cause he's starting to realize that all these people were setting them up\nI think it's really interesting your interview this morning I'm which of course I was on wait to see it but I read the transcripts or he lays out a very interesting set of\nEvents and circumstances in people and timing that raises a lot of questions I think for anybody who had a real desire to know exactly what was happening with the ... and how it got started um who the players or what the aim was I mean what he lays out he makes a good case for himself and\nFor the you know his theory\nThat he was being set up in an effort to um to then be able to go after the Trump campaign in some way or the president himself said he when\nI'm I think people should listen to what he has to say and and make a judgment about it but you know he's drawing some links and connecting the dots or in a way that I think raised a lot of very very serious question\nAnd I'll paraphrase show and he said that one of the tweet to Peter truck had\nWas a that he goes we are beginning to what our source or or or Russian source or or source in England when Britain is beginning to talk about Russia connections it was the same day that invested or downer a it was the day after he met with him about that are down there\nAnd he ended up being a tape conversation to somehow Peter ... get that he does not believe that was a coincidence do on the Russians source original source I Know rushing connections to move to came up to me and approach me and asked me if I if they told me that Hillary Clinton's emails were about to be released\nTo really get information on solicited and then these asset by downer who turns out he's a British asset who gave millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and ... trillion of more than just\nInto dollars to the Clinton Foundation and ... trillion of more than just in the ... so he ... he says will data was even nice egos he was he was very aggressive towards me told me as you walk away from Trump these horrible person that we've never going to get elected\nSo I'm listening to all this they're all connected together and something else to this cruise to re steel made in his name by investigating the world cup and exposing corruption right guess who was a member of the world cup committee\n...\nTo do not get George mix it and he's one of the few not to get charged so there's a relationship there before Donald Trump was even running for president to say it's a drama that you can't believe that that actually probably took place\nRight and if it were scripted as a movie [laughter]\nMight say like this is just too fantastical I mean it's just all of the different links and all of the different connection and you think about that guy twenty eight years old at the time I thought he was doing a good thing by um you know helping out at a campaign and the candidate that he's very much ... than it sounds like he's still very much does do believe in\nUm the ... but feeling that now that he would upon in the situation and that's that's highly possible I mean when you think about the level of sophistication of the people that he was interacting with and their connection to each other\nUm it just raises so many questions along the way I'm sure you've thought as many Americans have thought I'm with things that have been uncovered you think about what would these people thinking at the time some of these key players\nAnd it's only can be that they just assume like most people did there was no way that Hillary Clinton wouldn't become president\nBecause some of these things are so sloppy and questionable you think they could not have ever thought they were going to have to answer for some of these things right\nHe's the insurance plan he believes anyway so here he is when he realized just a couple of weeks ago that according to his lawyers misfits is a British show works for British Intelligence with\nSuicide infamous professor Joseph ... so this multi professor that are just a couple of days ago or more\nTo simply we're living in London and as a professor exactly\nI'm living in London tied to all these western intelligence groups but then you know he starts to present himself as a Russian tighter and basically a couple of days ago his own lawyer one public and said that he was working for the FBI not Russia so it's very confusing I don't understand why his own lawyer would make such a statement if it is false I don't believe it's called\nWe're to talk of the quad cities
