means is I've been doing it for a really long time it's kind of know what I'm doing okay perfect so in running that business\nKnow what I'm doing okay perfect so in running that business we found that we needed a good a chemical and we were using Fox were Galbraith actually um but it seemed to um\n[noise] that we needed to give our clients have better I Need to get the prices down basically to be able to sell a these remodeling projects and created a relationship with well born cabinets ah USA made and ash for to al Ashland, Alabama\nAnd I'm so we just were buying candidates for remodeling company well we put them in the show room over their bare floors right down the street from Fox worse than\nNew homebuilders are coming and saying we want these cabinet that's funny yeah so we were we as the remodeling company we're putting cabinets and some of these new homes in town\nAnd so we had to create a new company just to put that in New new homes and so that's that does is take notes obit

by the by county contractors association and they were solely responsible for its gone to\nThe talk of the quad cities and eleven thirty AM change you in a rally on Ninety nine point nine FM K. two sixty meal Prescott\nMountain gardeners aid for by water garden center and it's only responsible for its content\nWelcome to the mountain gardener on cakes you in a with local garden expert Ken Lay mountain gardening can be challenging but with can tip certain things are ... huge rewards now welcome your host can lane\nWill come to this week's edition of the mountain gardener wow it has been a changing week this has been what happened to summer I went from summer to winter just like that\nSo uh it it's been moist actually the planting the the the digging this oil is easy to work with than ever the maple have turned the Asher beautiful purple you're starting to see all the all colors showing up in the mountains of Arizona\nAnd this is also the time you want to pay at those things if you if you're from the desert that South where you just don't see a lot of that that northern or mid western fall color or the mountains of Arizona fall color and you want a beautiful new aspirin or new maple or new Asher new\nUh this is the best season for planting those for choosing those because you've got a tremendous selection at the garden centers it's also a good time in that as the plants turn this magical fall color also start to read the root for the next month or so\nSo that that's really what you want plant and then habits start rooting right away if you're planting now though I mean this kind of weather we've had this week it doesn't always happen that way sometimes you'll get dry spells through winter\nIf we get a dry spell you'll need to supplement water\nThat new planting it goes for anything that's been planted this year really so don't turn that system off next month we're talking two three four five weeks from now a year landscape is going to go I'm going to shut down the system and then expect plans to go for the next five months with no water\nYou may have to drag the hose out what her by hand especially if you're gonna plant that beautiful new\nColorado spruce or new Austrian pine or a new maple you'll want to\nOf water that to keep it healthy it's going to form those new route hairs but then if that ground gets crusty and dry and just\nBone dry those new routes can be tripled up and so you'll lose that growth you would have it would have been such a benefit to have that additional six eight ten inches of a real growth that fall\nDoubled down on that next spring and by next summer you've got a super hearty super healthy can take on the heat take the wind\nSuper hearty super healthy can take on the heat take the wind take the whatever summers got for us it'll take it because you've planted it in the fall this is a tremendous time to be planting\nWe've also what you'll find is your garden centers are bumping up their their winter evergreen inventory because we need to bring that ... now so we can acclimated and we're predicting how much in the tour when to sell to winter because once it really gets cold\nI'm Talking the new year or so\nOr you know two thousand Nineteen ... you know new year she doesn't maintain you can't start shipping plants into the mountains of Arizona then if they're truly ... they've lost their leaves and you bring them those are okay but if you're bringing more\nNamed dino are heavily bamboo or or red leaf\nA ... or a silver Barry Eli Agnes could Tony as these broad leaf evergreens if you bring those in from a warmer climate into your market into your to Flagstaff are White Mountains or ... or\n... or wherever it is you're bringing those plants in and they go into this deep cold they're just not used to that yet\nEither not acclimated so we're trying to predict the computers tell us okay again you're going to sell three hundred and ... between now and February fifteenth\nOrder that many were bringing them in now so that we can actually make them and that way the landscapers homeowners that are new to the area they can come in and still plant be confident that that plant is used to our climate used our\nCold temperatures warm temperatures and they can planted with confidence\nSo you'll see a A N in Greece and the varieties and choices of evergreens at your nurseries right now it's a great time to plant also you'll see some big like this week I got some really big uh Colorado spruce pines\nThese these big Christmas tree looking\nYou know central leaders swooping branches kind of plants ... seizures a red woods you know there's a there's a variety of sequoia that will actually grow\nIn the mountains Arizona we've got those in now and bigger sizes and you wouldn't be able to find other seasons in spring or summer of next year it's a good time the negative\nIf they're big they're have any I mean it's ridiculous some of those soils I Can't believe we're there building houses right now it's crazy a fact I just had to put a Seventy pound Jack hammer home the painting truck\nThe thirty five pound or which is the normal to see you know to just ... pop straight through\nUh the clay soil and things it was an accident the guys were begging for a bigger hammer when you go for it get get the bigger the bigger impact hammer to a head on it to get to get the space that really knocks out the clays soils backs away at the chipped away at that rock gets it out of there\nIf you're having a big tree delivered to your house consider\nHaving your gardener your plant or your nursery plant it for you they'll have the tools hopefully\nThey're going to have the tools on the truck they're going to have the right to the gamers the rate they know what size whole so ... with a big let's say it's a thirty five gallon a thirty five gallon spruce tree\nThat thing is probably thirty inches wide the root ball and about Eighteen Inches deep\nSo when you're planting that you'll want that whole to be about the same depth the bucket about Eighteen twenty inch\nYour ears taxing the soil underneath to see if you think that soil will drain or not so if you've dug enough holes in the mountains of Arizona you kind of get a feel you just know oh man I jackhammers banned the bouncing off the bottom of that whole the single never drain you were digging a big bath tub here\nIf that's a case will take the Jack hammer and try to fracture that soil underneath so we break it up to the water will search seeping into the next soil band underneath the roots of that new tree\nYou need someone that can make some calls like that and and you're going to a lot lighter so I'm going to be thirty and she's going to be sixty Seventy inch wide hole because the roots goes sideways they don't go down\nAnd so you're digging this whole sideways and pulling out the junk the anything bigger than a golf ball of of old roots rocks you'll find bricks\nTimbers of the builders Chuck didn't buried in the front yard you want to pull all that stuff out so you're left with a screenwriter screened type of soil and other routes can go through that then you want to men that state get to get it going there is a technique to planting the main thing\nThe reason I don't plan to larger plants of my own backyard even though I Am very capable I Know what to do\nI meet the planting ... out there with cooking and tea and water and um I'll pop a chair and kind of life at the great hey guys what you do and how what you're doing for this weekend I'll I'll converse with them\nBut I'm not planting it because it's too heavy handed to back surgeries\nAnd can't feel my right foot it's hard to mountain bike with it 'cause it's kind of like going around I don't want to injure myself any more uh so I have anything over let's say a Fifteen gallon size plant I have the planting crude do it and it's worth\nEvery dime I mean that ... at our place everyone has a different way of of charging for that sometimes it's just the labor just have a guy's power and\nThrow the plant in the ground and leave so their prices pretty inexpensive hours includes everything so we're throwing the ... the food the stakes the fertilizers the\nThe root and grow into I mean everything more more time and the whole so half of that costs typically at at least the friends I hang out with their own garden centers they are about half that price has got to be the product all the stuff it takes to plant it correctly\nAnd then the rest of it it's going to be hit chips is expensive to roll guys in a truck and haven't bland and get all the stuff out and go plant to just take this time for the people to go do that it's not free you need to pay for but it's worth it for a big plant that's specially\nIf you've got a gardener sometimes you're more and blow your maintenance guys they don't necessarily know that much they know there's leaves that dropped on your crushed granted needed to blow it up they know that much but how to plant an actual tree may or may not there you might like like\nIf you're buying a plant tear waters garden center we have these planting guides asked for the planting guide when you go to your nursery\nBut they're right there by the house and we don't really think about um they're fine they always winter over there very old I think I think kids would be equally as tough\nThe thing to watch with your containers since this is a container cells that contain or questions [noise]\nMake sure if you're gardening through winter that you water those plants if you get a a cold snap that seats in January\nAnd the weather is going to oh my God it was just going to be a big storm is going to be a cold wind people run to the grocery stores and they ended the shells and they go and they hunker down they hibernate for a week or the storm passes ... if you see that kind of a dent\nMake sure that your watering your plants before the colds comes a hydrated plant will go through that cold snap no matter how cold 'cause it's got it's got it's moist so the anti freeze within the structure of that plant can move back and forth if it's a dry plans kind of counterintuitive\nIf it's dry you would think oh it'll stay warmer wetter ... it'll start shivering if it's wet no plans don't shiver only we do\nYou do hear you keep the that that moisture in that plant especially container plans because they try a little faster they drained faster it's easier to growing up because of all those factors but the you just want to make sure you moist knows those plants up so that they can take that cold\nOr if you put them up against the house it takes a little pressure off but a a note of magnolias evergreen beautiful southern magnolia that takes cold it takes the colds\nDon't worry about it just keeps I driven with that we're out of time we'll be right back with more on the mountain gardeners\nRecently that mountain

eighth and yet they flew by Arizona flowers like being with mom and her garden what\nHelp with planning it's all on line at all and that's something that or do you buy the Arizona nursery association at plant something dot org the a lot of\nReady to rock and you look for your landscape Hi this is Sam and our team at Prescott dirt with how you design your bronco ways we're happy to be an author I

located has guess impressive I get from the ... the second plane for\nMore on line that precedent dot com and we will rock you\nMention bureau and I'm excited to see when they wind up from what I've done as we wait for the mention heroes show on the talk of the quad cities do and I\nDidn't leave\nHas ran waters garden center\nYou are listening to the mountain Gardner with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but with Ken hipster things are named fight you'll read huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner no fall\nIs the absolute most important feeding of the entire year this is if you're only going to feed once your landscape you should be doing it more than that but if you're only going to do it one time middle of the what the landscape starve the rest of the year this is the one you do not want to miss\nThat didn't go over the different kinds of fertilizers\nAnd I'd start with fertilizer steaks at some of the competitors are making the rounds making sure we're in the marketplace competitive some going out there's lots of fertilizer stakes these hard ... spikes that you can drive into the ground and they're supposed to last year\n... don't use those stopped selling those Twenty years ago\nAnd here's why in the mountains of Arizona worry very alkaline water and and rocky soil that that fertilizer steak will actually stay there for a year or more\nOf this so it's it's slow to release the problem is where are the main routes on your plants it's almost impossible to find out\nAnd so if you had a lot of top soil and that that bubble around that fertilizer steak were to permeate seep and in a week away and and and\nActually fertilize a larger area volume of soil it would be okay but first of all they're expensive because of the number that you need to drive around the larger tree it's just it's just a difficult one doesn't do it you're going to need ten around a big Arizona cypress are big spruce or a big maple you're gonna need more\n... and then where do you play some you'd be better off crushing that thing up\nAnd sprinkling that underneath the can of beer the drip line of that that tree or that shrub then you went to drive it in the ground because at least then to that granular that your ground up what would slowly permeate breakdown go to the soil the plant will pick it up and you've got the anti\nMeet breakdown go to the soil the plant will pick it up and you've got the entire ah that tire radius or underneath that drip line fertilized properly\nThat's called a synthetic fertilizers these are chemical based up petroleum based typically Kim of fertilizers Scots and to me is or does these these brand names or Arizona\nThere's several of them that are chemically base there they're they're made from petroleum your sprinkle those things around uh basically\nThey released when water hits them go into the ground and then for life to plant that would be better than a spike because at least you know where it's going to go the negative\nThey released too fast so within a month all that fertilizers pretty much been released with the reins gone into the soil and sometimes it's in a form to plant can receive sometimes it's not\nSo ammonium ... sulfate is better in the summer ammonium nitrate are better than the winter so sometimes plant can pick up\nA boy I didn't want to go deep into fertilizers but basically it's temperature related when it's cool the plants can pick up certain kinds of food and they can't their summer foods so it's kind of like a burgers and dogs that's for a fourth of July weekend\nBut I ain't gonna have that outside of the yard with it's a you know twenty degrees out I'm going to have steak and potatoes or chicken soup\nAnd so really that's the benefit of\nAn organic fertilizer or all natural so we make of it made a fertilizer years and years ago ... huge following go all purpose planted not a very original man but it's seven for for all natural in the main ingredients are cotton seed meal\nWhich lowers the ph at the nitrogen source\nBird guano it it's ... it's got kind of an earthy smell it's ... it's just easier to spread but smells are the because of those cuts the meal and the\nAnd the bird wanna sulfur iron some other stuff so that's the same greeted as those organics breakdown they break down much slower over a very long period of time typically about three months\nSo it's not releasing all the food at once and so the plant can pick up more of that food than let's say an organic would just release all at once is picking up parts of it the rest of it it flushed away and gone that's a synthetic an organic the plants can pick up virtually all of the fertilizer\nAnd use it so you get less waste\n... longer a feeding than you would a synthetic I highly recommend using organic organic granular fertilizers for most of your plants out in the landscape\nIt's kinda like it's like an antibiotic I mean it's going to make the plant hearty healthy it's like chicken soup for the soul bats what an organic fertilizer is set in the in the fall of the year if you've not done that I cannot emphasize this enough the benefits for the mountains and it's because\nYou folks in the mid west you poor folks\nFrom the mid west you just don't you eight foot of topsoil you no longer have\nWe've got eight millimeters if any topsoil and your landscape and then we we put the fabric over top of the soil and then we put rock on it to make sure no organics ever get down into the soil again\nYou're going to have to fertilize more often up in the mountains of Arizona just because our soils we just don't have a lot of top soil\nSo you need that's where the nutrients are held you have to fertilize it more often so I suggest to three times a year minimum four times if you if you have a lot of evergreens\nUh it'd be Easter do you think holidays Easter fourth of July and Halloween that's when you fertilize New Years for lots of Colorado spruce Theodore cedars pines and then\nUh I Would say for your your native evergreens they would greatly benefit from fertilizing with that all purpose plant food and anything that stress to also give it\nSo the golf course I got some so in those bad bets look in the parking lot was just the redwoods\nRight oh right and I think a lot of people don't even think about 'em but they're another tree\nThat has very susceptible to over water yeah that's true so plan to get it rooted in ... elected and watch it grow [laughter] don't neglect it to you know [laughter] so it it is a good time to come look for if you're thinking about living tree for Christmas maybe\nUm I Would say don't wait too long because I think they're going to go fast this year yeah I think were\nInfected team is going to put together a\nLiving Christmas tree kind of package kind of thing you could give to as a gift to someone ... we were selling more living trees and we do cut trees anymore so we saw hundreds of countries of Christmas trees in December\nWill this is the ... the front load for a living trees living Christmas trees evergreens now so it's a good time you can pick up the best one or you can add so yeah that's

plants that something dead or brought you by the Arizona nursery association that plant something dot org you'll allow that to\nBelieve in rising working hard to end the fruits of our labor martyrs after\nYou are listening to the mountain gardener with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but what can tip to change things are named five you'll reap you towards now welcome to the mountains are back\nOn the mountain gardener host Ken Lay and I this one of the beauty of having a garden center here in northern Arizona is especially in Prescott we kept the most interesting people that live here and they come and they shopped plants and you get to talk until many oh\nThat's a great story we have to capture that on air and so I've got two gentleman a John Murphy and Daniel Blake who are\nLocals there here on a bus that got this great garden\nVision great garden project going and I thought you would take an interest in that as well so welcome John welcome Daniel glad you're here in the studio thanks for having us I guess so so now this is to make one hundred healthy foundation now that caught my year\nIn a in a time when you jalapeno peppers are coming out of Mexico with the coal I all over 'em and then you put them into Safeway or\nFries or cause wherever and they can kill you and this happens two or three times a year this is becoming a problem the Mac massive agriculture your goal is bringing local ... absolutely we want people to bring back the art of backyard gardening\nLocal gardening and why it's so important to get your nutrition from food that you can control it strikes really not just a luxury anymore and the whole idea of backyard gardening\nWas a big thing back in World War two victory gardens were a patriotic duty but right away and now we have forty percent obesity so or make one hundred healthy foundation mission is to help fellow Americans grow one million organic vegetable gardens over the next five years and we're kicking off right here\nIn ... president that right I hear a lot of us who have been these things don't have it usually that's New York city or Chicago or someplace so now you've also got so so they make one hundred healthy foundation has got this goal but then you partnered up\nWith Daniel Blake which is an old friend we've been going back decades I Know I Know he's a gardener\nAnd I know Daniel you have traveled the world helping people farm better smarter wrote me a third world countries that's been your passion now you're back home and your partner with John you're going to show that expertise with is how does that partnership work\n\nWill can ah when I got the opportunity to leave the country was always because there was a great need there were children there were sick and they needed to have better food so I had an opportunity to go down and teach now I Want to do it here local\nSo that's perfect so now you're just set up gardens\nAnd then you're going to bring expertise it'd be like you've been smarter than I Am as far as gardening do you can make things he could make the microphone restrict it put it in the dirt you're going to health over here and help us to start growing her own foods here here locally that's right\nWhat do you do that will gardener backyard garden yeah so how does what give it a tease me what what's what's something that maybe\nWe can do in our own backyards a lister over ... flak who could use right now that would maybe make their game their guard game a little better\nWell can I get a closer to the soil and I started digging the soil with a digging fork and I start adding organic matter to it and gypsum and other minerals to make it alive so what kind of organic struck horse manure use chicken coop\nUsed gypsum or fertilizer worth what ... what are you dig in with that for and what happens when you hit a Boulder a dig around at moving [laughter]\nI was just sharing earlier with ... with the audience we just bought a Seventy pound hammer for the for the planting truck because the rocks are becoming\nTheir like growing or the where people are building are on ... more and more it seems like there's less soil there it's hard to grow things without the soil\nWell I Would have had a gypsum is important because uh all the nutrients piggyback onto the gypsum and to the calcium to get into the plant they got to have the calcium and that was the right form of calcium for Arizona soils and then I add organic matter\nAnd then I started adding a nitrogen and phosphorus potassium and I work that soil get close to it I ...\nSo this square foot gardening or is this row gardening or how would you prefer if you want to maximize I say I've got a backyard and I'm only going to have a hundred square feet of ten by ten area raised bed goes up I don't have any other soil elsewhere so I made it out of tempers are black or whatever how ... how would\nYou what would be the formula to make that go\nFor a minute we're not formula I well let's just say ships that would not do I use the natives soil 'cause that's not good stuff\nWell that's true of some of it isn't very good but then some of it is so different parts of Prescott have clay and most people don't like to dig and clay clay holds your nutrient veteran hold your water longer true so I got to do there is admired ... matter to it and that kind of makes it\nYeah sweet and healthy gotcha and what's your favorite plant to grow what's the most let's see your third world country you're helping wherever you helped grow or help third world community is\nEat better Mexico believes hunters and Africa gotcha well okay so to countenance looks pretty good and a growing part of the sudden now you're going to third this is not there were there were third world but\nYou're here in America helping us grow smarter that's right what was the main crops that they like to grow their to rice and beans or or what are they mainly doing they grew every vegetable you can imagine you can absolutely gotcha okay not just tomatoes yeah or\nThe gotcha okay not just tomatoes yeah or I was thinking peppers or something like that there is a spicy pepper that I Love and Mexico so good so we've got an event foundation coming up there and you're going to share some of these tidbits of of what do we need to to to do\nTo grow better will tell us about the foundation and you've got some events come up in November and October your ... your first garden up happening is started really happening and and just to touch on\nThe way Daniel and I got together I had this big vision to help bring backyard garden get people healthier and then I met this guy the gardener of destiny and so it's like a you know higher power thing so how this has evolved is we do have our vents on veterans' day or it's November twelfth\nAt five thirty PM at the Columbia Prescott lakes it's our first kick off the record and kick all sorts of gala event Daniels the keynote we have Dr Steven Brown who lives in Prescott lakes who talks about why you should get your nutrition phone foods rather than supplements and I'll be talking about longevity I'm known as your make one hundred healthy guy\n'cause I'm all about trying to make people healthy and live a long life\nAnd there was paid for by waters garden center and there were only responsible for its content [noise]\nWe're in a jogger Guam eleven thirty AM cage you for your belly and on Ninety nine point nine empty the Oprah [noise]\nFinancially tuned is paid for by American financial security solely responsible for content [noise]\nIs financially to which runs Stevenson Albert sort of fetuses for American financial investment for stirred investment advisor would have hurt your financial strategy is out of tune\nYour long term goals your retirement savings and you're like until you can also for many years of experience in the financial industry around in ... provide their clients and prospects information they need regarding Social Security retirement income plenty of management and much more\nListening as we address your financial concern and provide helpful solution with you on the parents were cheating your retirement money your plans for for now Iran and Barbara you point out mentally dude\nAnd Arizona good morning again I have for part to Marianne ... came back with us from grading investments maryann thank you so much for joining us again Barbara it's my pleasure to be here\nYou know we just finished at an earlier show where we talked a lot about um the investment partnership that we have between American financial investments and grading investments and how your advisory team\nHas grown to ... billion in assets under management big number growing all the time\nWe preach a lot if you will with clients about the power of diversification because many of the people who come to the Prescott area are retiring we have a great retirement area people from very successful walks of life but we've seen many people come in with\nPerhaps it over concentration\nOf stock in a company they have recently left talked to was a little bit about\nWhy we might want to begin to change and diversify out as a company we knew and worked with and built a career in now that we're not there anymore\nRight so the whole issue of diversification is risk and eat any company no matter whether they're producing cereal or chemicals or anything um there's risk involved with that company stock\nAnd to have a concentration in just one name really just puts an awful lot of risk into your account\nSo when people come in we typically you know review the stock for them and we'll make a recommendation but it will always be at least pair off a little bit of that and put your money into some other investments to make you less risky\nYou know the interesting thing about that is that even when you're inside of a company in an executive management position kind of in the no\nA and a publicly held company as I did with both EDS and oracle and and you have done even inside the company what we talk about what we know about that we cannot act on because we may be in a thirty day window\nOf in the nose so we can't do anything and the market says something completely different about our stock so even when you're in the inside and you know what's going on you can't predict how that stat stock is going to perform it's got to be even more impossible to try to do that from the outside\nWell it's really I've run into so many uh CEOs who get frustrated with the stock price because they know how things are going but they don't appreciate how the market is viewing things and it could be a\n... the situation at their competitor or something else going on the in the economy something about valuations that are just changing and so it is sometimes even a surprise to management as to where the stock price is going\nAbsolutely and you know before we go further I Want to back up a minute because if you missed our last show you don't know who marry in ... or grading investments they are our financial\nPartner and portfolio world of assets under management to be in the market space\nMarianne has chartered financial analyst with them and as you said on the last show the four of view designers and analysts who actually manage these portfolios have a combined experience in this crazy piece of the pie\nOf over a hundred years right so you have seen markets calm markets goes sectors comes sectors go politics come politics go interest rates up stocks up stocks down but you've seen it All right\nAll right so that when you say diversification is key you don't say that ...\nKnow now and\nYou know just a personal story my father worked for General Motors he had all the confidence in the world in General Motors\nFortunately General Motors wasn't has only investment but he saw them cut the dividends a couple of different times over the course of his career it was extremely detrimental to the stock price has he held on because he trusted his management team\nAnd I I quite frankly he was still holding some stock when they went bankrupt\nSo you know I I Know a single handedly that um the stocks don't always go the way the employees and retired employees think that the stock price should go and that's why you just don't want to have the concentration in any one particular name\nYes now you can take diversification to the extreme we saw a portfolio that someone brought to as a few weeks ago and out of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars they had gosh I don't remember\nThat twenty five different fund allocations in there and frankly those numbers were\nNot they were broken down there were so diversified that it really didn't make a difference if it went up they didn't get enough if it went down they didn't get hurt and\nNet net over diversification isn't good either correct especially if you're diversifying into tiny bits of the same thing\nRight and part of the process here with great in investments is that your clients can submit their current holdings to us and they may have to draw them from all different directions\nAnd a lot of times they don't realize what they've amassed over time that is very common yeah so we have a whole team here of I'm certified financial planner see employees\nWho will analyze their holdings\nAnd they will show what type of risk they've been taking and what type of return they'd been actually getting off that portfolio and then we can look at and say this is what you really want going forward with it is it satisfying your income needs that satisfy your gross made is it too risky or not enough risk\nThat satisfy your growth made it too risky or not enough risk and we'll look at all of that and we'll make a recommendation but in all cases\nYour clients command decide whether they like our recommendation nothing is ever sold or forced on anyone ... out there on the table for them to pick up and embrace if they want\nModify we can tweak some things but then now it's going into active management and they'll be able to see their holdings in one spot going forward\nAnd get some a regular report says to the performance and again having this relationship with you they can say well things have changed and so what is the recommendation under our new circumstances right tweak the portfolio from there\nYou know that's one of the key things that happens I always tell people that you can do your own taxes\nUntil you have a life event and some significant change comes in\nThe treasury a curve ball and then\nNow maybe or\nSelling announced that you never even known to before because you inherited it you don't really understand that maybe you're getting married maybe there's been a death in the family maybe you've inherited something and that's something that we talked with our clients about is that\nIt's not so much that your hopes and dreams change as long as we have our health we have so much to be thankful for but hopes and dreams\nDon't necessarily change that much but our life circumstances do for him and so that sometimes causes are\nRisk acceptance level to change it go way there have more money to play with or we have less right\nRight so when when big institutions are have critical responsibilities of making money and doing something that is within safety guidelines at produces both income and or\nGrows and\nLike a big college for instance of big institution how do they go about um there's something called in and ... fun\nRight right so ... songs are something that's a created for most of the major colleges and universities University of Arizona has won ASU has won\nEnd down meant finds lots of news about interest rates and I knew that interest rates particularly impact the bond world can you talk to it's a little bit about that\nAbsolutely well we have to look back at history and we know that interest rates tend to go in the same direction for about Twenty years or about one generation and so we've just come off at twenty year period of declining interest rates\nNow they weren't straight down but they were in a downward trend for Twenty years and we reached all time lows about a year and a half ago\nAnd now we're looking at a twenty year period of rising ... so for anyone who's held bombs over the last Twenty years who both very high likelihood you've made a lot of money in those ah you know they're typically designed to offer you that return of principle plus a little interest\nWell now you have this trend that that's really a headwind for about the next generation a name and that it means that as interest rates go up by values go down\nYes and you know that there is a confusing conundrum out there that maybe you can shed a little light on is interest rates\nWe kind of like the fact that when we borrow interest rates are low at the same time we don't like the fourteenth and accounts at the bank for our liquid money\nAnd then we have this inflation\nFor ages and regardless of what\nPeople say about zero inflation we know our health care costs have gone up we know our grocery costs have gone up so there is inflation out there because things cost more and then we have the market that if you even mention rising interest rates oh gosh we get all of a flood or they're\nA little bit about how those kind of inter relate\nOkay well first of all I Will say that yes we're seeing more inflation and die as you mentioned it's health care premiums I saw that Amazon is raising their rate for the prime members by\nTwenty percent I saw that nobody said wow that's inflation but it is\nBecause a lot of people have that um that's more of a job at discretionary type of item however\nUm but we are seeing a pick up the Federal Reserve wanted inflation pick up because we actually went through a period of deflation yes just a couple of years back and that's really bad for the economy is bad for corporations for corporate profits we need some amount of inflation\nOfficially it's about two percent ... food and energy but we all eat\nWe only have and we already today some [laughter] or Mars and most of us are putting gas in our\nCars so we see prices going up an index\nGas in our cars so we see prices going up in different parts we're also seeing some wage inflation which is really welcome after years of no wage inflation ... an increase in your take home pay\n'em but what we're seeing is a a a rising interest rates and some of its official the Federal Reserve has raised rates and they're expected to raise rates by small amounts quarter point writes time\nUh probably three or four times that's here in our estimation so another two or three times as here but in the meantime the market has decided well rate should be higher because we think inflation is going to make much higher and then they pulled back from that opinion\nUm but what happens is when you have\nHigher interest rates to pressure not only on bond prices but it's also a pressure on stock prices valuations\nRight is that because it costs them as interest rates go up at costs companies more to do things will it cost them more but\nAlso you have that risk free rate of three percent now out there in ten year government bonds whereas at the beginning of the year you only got two point four percent so people are sitting there going well do I want to risk my money on the stock market or do I want to lock into three percent\nGovernment bonds that's more attractive these days I might take some money out of the stock market\nAnd put it into bombs and it's especially attractive versus you know what you can get on that sixty days CD or something like that site so they're all interrelated but the bottom line is if you have bombs in your portfolio right now that have a maturity out there in\nTwenty four twenty forty five twenty fifty maybe your stockbroker put you into those because they were stretching for yield\nUm people wanted that four percent type of field so they were willing to go out in time with their maturity\nThat's very dangerous territory those are the ones that are hurt the most from rising interest rates those longer maturity date so my um recommendation is when you bring your portfolio to Barbara Enron\nBringing your bond holdings let's take a look at those bombed holdings we do manage bond portfolios\nWe don't have individual bombs in them because there's a certain market risk associated with having small positions under a million dollars I'd say I'm In a specific bond name\nBut um we use ATF and then we also have those\nI narrowed down to shorter maturity is things that we can\nAh for instance create a bomb ladder and we'll take a portion of them each year and as they mature and reinvest them at higher interest rates are going up church we again expect to happen over the next Twenty years\nMhm excellent you know on a smaller scale uh sometimes people\nLand or if that's an unusual term for people the ladder their CDs mhm they're smaller CD amounts and they actually strategically set them to expire or mid towards case maybe and\nSix months apart or quarterly so that they have an opportunity to\nTake a little chunk of cash out of that CD on a quarterly basis if they want to spend it on something or than they reinvest is that the similar process with the lab heard bond it is it is except\nI'm we're out in the market where using some ... uh investment grade credits and less than investment grade credit but the risk level is very low and if you look at historical basis um that the lower lower risk they're not as low as a bank of course\nBut it's really a good way to get some income and take advantage of higher rates by reinvest thing as they mature each year\nSome people like to do this just for a grand child's college educated yet and they can set up a four year by a ladder and so they have the money that's going to mature each of those four years and they can go to the University of your choice I'm so this is a way that we are trying to\nTake advantage if you will of rising interest rates and trying not to be in a ... advantageous position as we know rates are rising\nAnd you know a run talked with people all the time and\nWe never say there's a bad investment we never say that investment is good for everybody\nThere are very at a myriad of ways to skin a cat\nIt all comes down to each and every one of you out there as the wild card in your own retirement it starts with your\nOriginal working spending and saving pattern and now it's important and more you approach retirement or are in this\nPermanent unemployed stage of full retirement to stay on top of the investments you worked so hard to build and we do that through regular meetings with our planes because\nThings change markets change life change lots of ways to accomplish what people need to do whether that preserve
