[noise]\n\n\nBut I Know one thing burning care is never going to get done he's talking about Medicare for all supposed to be for seniors he's indoors like sixteen senators including almost all the ... pointing twenty twenty presidential candidates a hundred and twenty coach monitors so game plan this out\nDo you do your opponent wants Bernie care\nYeah well but let's let's let's put\nThe blame in both places Brian ya well done I'd say that Bernie says things that he doesn't mean he knows it can't happen he knows that are bankrupt the country and they think that the American people fall for and Republicans for seven years said we'll ... we'll call in and repeal Obamacare they didn't get it done right so it may be everybody needs to reach that but I won't points I agree with you on this Bryan that\nHealth care is too important to too many people to not realize that it's an issue that we have to face right eye you and I think would prefer technology competition more opportunities we don't want a single payer even sliding towards\nExpanded Medicaid or anything but we got to have stopped it right and we got to use we got to leverage technology I think Trump will be game for trying this you know try to leverage technology competition and and what we can do but\nYou're right we got to face it and and the Republicans haven't done it and by the way it's one thing the Democrats no they're running on that a little bit they're running and saying hey those guys were supposed to do something they didn't do it\nSo it is a problem that's got to be faced I Hope that the president knows that\nSo Bernie Sanders tries robust out in twenty fourteen in his state of Vermont He tries to roll out of Lebanon point five percent payroll tax cut a nine point five\nIt's a ... point five percent payroll tax splits a nine point five percent income tax and with marine creatures coming even progressive couldn't get single payer up and running for only six hundred and twenty five thousand people they do a better than it by twenty six million\nVoters rejected the referendum to set up and go pay or in Colorado so what is going on the Republican might not have the answer would they have to find a way to underline what Democrats thinks he is really doesn't help anybody\nDoctors get paid less than a leader fashion\nRight well and the problem though is Bryan his voters\nVote on what they see right they see Trump and Kanye they see the economy and they see healthcare is a mess so I you know I well I agree you got to try to explain how crazy Bernie is and how men more importantly how bankrupting his vision is you know as you point out one of the things people don't realize yes it would cost trillions of dollars\nBut it would also take out of your hands decisions about healthcare you want to see people write\nTell them they can't go to their doctor they have to go to the doctor over there I mean people so this is and that's the thing that's really damning about this social isn't that they're doing is they take away from the individual\nControl you have to give up control of things you care about but I got to tell you I look I I think it's just pure politics the Democrats know that got an issue that's kind of a wedge the Republicans don't have a good answer that you can explain in one sense or one uh one image and so we got to get through this election and they better step up and do something about it\nYeah so the president and so when you look at the numbers and talk to people\nWhat percentage would you I Know you want you want to Republican control everything but we were ... do you give the Republicans for holding on to the house first\nWell I look I've been somebody uh Brian you you maybe you won't be too surprised I've been saying it's going to be a Trump bread wave since January and the reason why is because\nI I'm from Missouri right in Missouri they told me the polls told me on the day before election Trump it was going to win Missouri by four percent he won by Nineteen percent I see nothing that has taken away from the coalition to Republicans and I see a lot that's taken away from the Democrats show I look I think they hold the house\nI might be honest I think the whole house a hundred percent I actually think they're going to hold the house with exactly what they have or maybe more I noticed people think I'm Crazy but I don't think anybody understands how the bottom look\nThe other thing Phyllis Schlafly my old boss who's to say the late so to slap like one of the best thing she ever did\nWas run for Congress twice and lose and I ran twice and lost myself you learn how campaigns go at this point in the campaign you can't really change the trajectory of the race she just got to kind of tweak it and the bottom is going out on the Democrats because not because of Kavanaugh\nBecause of the economy plus cabin up plus just know attraction and they get to do it I tell people give me one reason I Do the old Tracy Chapman's I'll give me one reason\nTo be a Democrat tell me one reason maybe healthcare that's what they say but not really so I think it's about a hundred percent they hold the house to be honest\nI Want you to read Amy Walters said in the from the cook Political Report she'd say listen we we are right now no one's listening to each other we're on a separate corners cut forty to\nBecome which team are you on the on the ... team or are you going to be on the other team and the entire presidency has been basically about taking your side taking your team\nAnd for ... to put the red hat on than he literally it saying I'm going against my team and they're the backlash to that and the same way that Republicans who said or people who\nWere normally ... going to the team they get the credit for doing that there is nothing left there is no middle there's not going to be a middle and this election it's just going to I think\nWe're in there get into these deemed themes the polar pull around and we just for them\nAnd let you know it unless the party in power holds power but if it's split it's going to be accusations and uh and interrogations\nYeah well most Brian I Amy's missing the good a political revolution it's happening because the Republican Party has has dramatically changed I mean we chased off some of the never Trump hers who were sort of global is she wanted a different don't you know not not social conservative not conservative and my and we've added a bunch of people that are working class what for I'm from Missouri\nFor Thirty years we had Democrats say they ran for president on it it can get part ran for president to get rid of NAFTA it was a Republican got written after I got rid of TPP got us out of Paris\nI mean the party that the Republican Party and the Democratic party or trance transforming\nThe problem for Amy Walter she doesn't see it but the problem for Democrats as they're transforming to a party of women\nAnd anti men they're not even attracting African Americans what's the message that Nancy Pelosi has\nTo an African American about his future her future right now they don't have a message that doesn't last long politically so I think he's wrong I think she was wrong in twenty sixteen I think we're in a political revolution were to mass movement moment that people lot of people don't recognize that what's happening\nBut

Brecht the referendum but when I was so called populist movements in Europe and elsewhere and so I'm really trying to address what I think is going on\nAnd um and what\nUm how leaders business and

image Prager here on the walls and fought for people um international politics [noise] former prime minister of Canada is on the line Steven Harper was\nSeven years I looked to Canada I had kind of envy there wasn't forty and it was actually real I I did I remember at the time when when we had our left wing president and they had this very thoughtful intelligent conservative prime minister so\nPop or by the way I just wonder what I call you prime minister Harper is that an American thing only in Canada when you're interviewed or you called Mr Harper prime minister\nUm well the ... there's a long answer that question data and I'll keep it short which is in Canada officially we do not keep the\nHeat the title prime minister but it is actually quite common for people to call me that nevertheless\nRight on so I was right Troy issue but I think it's more of an American\nPie I think it's nice but I was just curious well one of the reasons we love the Americans [laughter] exactly\nFeeling about just it was called a barricade radio station ... exactly [laughter] the prime minister has written a book out this week right\nBut it's there is written a book out this week right\nHe's one of the most awful lot of people as I said in international politics so were you surprised that Donald Trump won why don't you feel on election day twenty sixteen us election day\nSo I tell people I was surprised I was less surprised than most I had\nIncluded mostly through what I had been told anecdotally by a large number of Canadians who have been going back and forth the u._s. than my own experiences going back and forth that a lot of Canadians who'd been down there and the final weeks had told\nMe they thought Donald Trump was going to win so\nI gave him a a low but nevertheless the plausible chance of winning\nUh so I was I I must admit I Would still a surprise but I was not shocked\nAt a shock to some observers not only were but still clearly are\nSo back to Canada is there a chance that conservatives can come back to power\nOh I think absolutely we've got a chance um you know we've been uh polls go back and forth we'd been in a you know within the margin of error and a lot of them um [noise] the uh our fundraising is far exceeds the government\nI think the issues that are on our side of the area we faced in Canada Dennis I don't mind telling you is that um you know we have very little in the way of conventional conservative media television every network is MSNBC in Canada\nUm is really amazing when you look at places like Ontario and Quebec and you were to see the election coverage especially in the province Ontario he would not imagine the conservative party is going to get any votes at all\nAnd yet they won the election and won it handily so I'm a I'm optimistic but it's a book I leave a I leave the day to day have Canadian politics the my successor whose name is Andrew share and go I think will make a great and thoughtful and intelligent informed prime minister which really badly need\nI Want to underscore from our listeners what you just said because whenever I speak to consider a conservatives in Europe\nThis comes up and sometimes they say if only we have to talk radio Europe why isn't fair and Canada I think I Know the answer but I'd rather have you explain why isn't there something like talk radio and kind of\nTalk radio does exist in candle\nI mean conservative talk radio forgive me okay\nYeah no no ... ... talk radio does exist a dentist and conservative talk radio does exist it's just much smaller and unfortunately a lot of our best conservative talk radio hosts not all of them but a lot of our best ones\nAre have been kind of at the stage where they're retiring in recent years but look it's an area where there really is the efficiency generally and what's interesting Dennis about that is generally a conservative talk radio hosts will do well\nIn terms of audience likewise conservative media to the extent that exists generally find that audience because there's a lot of meeting conservatives who are craving outlets but the fact is that the dying media continues to cater to all cater to a left wing audience\nThere was a powerful you said earlier I did not pass over be boys all all of our behavior MSNBC I Hope my sister's cool up that one that I look a I'm well aware of that\nSo there is however and I are frequently read at the national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago\nAs a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained a fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately\nA lot of its day to day reporting and calling this are simply not that bad and in terms of federal federal politics cup which I I Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper in\nTerms of of its day to day coverage of federal politics but its editorial rely line remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nTo hide it tough yeah yeah have you know a while you have you have to you have to look um\nYou have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market
