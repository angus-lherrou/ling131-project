what that means is I've been doing it for a really long time in kind of know what I'm doing okay perfect so in running that business we found that we needed a good\nA camera ... we were using Fox were Galbraith actually um but it seemed to um [noise] that we needed to give our clients have better\nI Need to get the prices down basically to be able to sell a these remodeling projects and create a relationship with well born cabinets uh USA made and ash for to al Ashland, Alabama\nAnd I'm so we just were buying candidates for our remodeling company well we put them in the show room over their bare floors right down the street from Fox worse than\nNew homebuilders are coming and saying we want these cabinet that's funny yeah so we were we as the remodeling company we're putting cabinets and some of these new homes in town\nAnd so we had to create a new company just to put ... in New new homes and so that's that businesses take notes obit Fox or um [noise]\nBarrett floors Michael and

index for a long time and it was on my radar for a year out and I'm thinking well he's sitting right here God must be and you need to start that that company now but the main reason I started that that company was the the need here everybody has got to\nMe you know\nEighty percent of the houses here have a deck at least one deck and uh there's been very few companies out there that will do that so we wanted to set up a\nA platform to serve those people and to give them good quality stuff some of the stuff we've been working on lately is amazing a tiger wood\nI don't know if you've ever I've never heard of it is to think of the Brazilian hard would it is gorgeous we just did that one of those I'm Out in Prescott lakes and we're working on one now and that is camera crew\nCamera crew and

composites everybody knows what those are but these hard woods\nYou put a little oil on them once a year and they'll stay beautiful for just as long as the composite ducking will um [noise] so and

I Know I have to you my girl and a couple of ... other than that I like I said people down is the railings and that sometimes it's hard it's hard to imagine what this really system's going to look like\nWe're the talk of the quad cities and eleven thirty AM change you in a brigade rally and on Ninety nine point nine FM Kay Tuesday the ...\nMountain gardeners aid for by water garden center and it's only responsible for content\nWelcome to the mountain gardener on Cape Cod name with local garden expert can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but with can tip certain things are ... huge rewards now welcome your husband can lame\nWelcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardener wow it has been a changing week this has been what happened to summer I went from summer to winter just like that\nSo uh it it's been moist actually the planting the digging this oil\nIs easy to work with than ever the maples have turned the Asher beautiful purple you're starting to see all the fall colors showing up in the mountains of Arizona this is also\nThe time that you want to plant those things if you if you're from the desert the south where you just don't see a lot of that\nThat northern or mid western fall color or the mountains of Arizona taught color and you want a beautiful new aspens or new maple or new Asher new\nUh this is the best season for planting those for choosing those because you've got a tremendous selection at the garden centers it's also a good time in that as the plants turn this magical fall color they also start to reach the root for the next month or so so\nThat that's really what you want plant and then have it start rooting right away if you're planting now though I mean this kind of weather we've had this week it doesn't always happen that way sometimes we'll get dry spells through winter\nIf we get a dry spell you need to supplement water that new planting it goes for anything that's been planted this year really so don't turn that system off next month for talking\nTo three or four or five weeks from now a year Lance uber is going to go I'm going to shut down the system\nAnd then expect plans to go for the next five months with no water\nYou may have to drag the hose out water by hand especially if you're gonna plant that beautiful new Colorado spruce or new Austrian pine or a new maple\nYou'll want to of water that to keep it healthy it's going to form those new route hairs but then if that ground gets crusty and dry and just bone dry those new routes can be shriveled up so you'll lose that growth you would have it would have been such a benefit to have\nThat additional six eight ten inches of a root grow\nThe sole doubled down on that next spring and by next summer you've got a super hearty super healthy can take on the heat take the wind take the whatever summers got for us it'll take it because you planted it in the fall this is a tremendous time to be planting\nWe've also what you'll find is your garden centers are bumping up their their winter evergreen inventory\nTheir their winter evergreen inventory 'cause we need to bring that ... now so we can acclimated and and we're predicting how much him endure when to sell to winter because once it really gets cold um talk in the new year or so\nOr you know two thousand Nineteen ... you know new year two thousand maintain\nYou can't start shipping plants into the mountains of Arizona then if they're truly dormant in ... they've lost their leaves\nAnd you bring up those are okay but if you're bringing more\nNamed dino are heavily bamboo or or red leaf a ... or a silver Barry Eli Agnes could Tony essays broadly evergreens if you bring those in from a warmer climate into your market into your see flag set for White Mountains or ... or\nTitan or wherever it is you're bringing those plants in and they go into this deep cold they're just not used to that yet\nEither not acclimated so we're trying to predict the computers tell us okay again you're going to sell three hundred and ... to ... between now and\nFebruary fifteenth order that many were bringing him and now so that we can acclimate them and that way that landscapers homeowners that are new to the area they can come in and still plant\nBe confident that plant is used to our climate used our cold temperatures warm temperatures and they can planted with confidence\nSo you'll see a an increase in the varieties and choices of evergreens which are nurseries right now it's a great time to plan also you'll see some big like this week I got some really big uh Colorado spruce pines these these big Christmas tree looking\nYou know central leaders swooping branches kind of plants Theodore cedars\nRedwoods you know there's a there's a variety of sequoia that will actually grow\nIn the mountains Arizona we've got those in now\nAnd bigger sizes and you wouldn't be able to find other seasons in spring or summer of next year it's a good time the negative if they're big they're heavy [laughter] I mean\nIt's ridiculous some of the soil I Can't believe we're there building houses right now it's crazy a fact I just had to put a Seventy pound\nJack hammer the painting truck\nThirty five pound or which is a normal cutesy you know to just ... pop straight through\nA clay soils and things it wasn't a hack and at the guys were begging for a bigger hammer would get your goal for it get get the bigger the bigger impact hammer to a head on it to get the get the space that really knocks out the clays soils next away at the chipped away at that rock get it out of there\nIf you're having a big tree delivered to your house consider having your gardener your plant or your nursery plant it for you [noise] they'll have the tools hopefully\nThey're going to have the tools on the truck they're going to have the right sticky Mars the rate they know what size whole so with a big let's say it's a thirty five gallon a thirty five gallon spruce tree that thing is probably thirty inches wide the root ball\nAnd about Eighteen Inches deep so when you're planting that you'll want that whole to be about the same depth visited bucket about Eighteen twenty inch\nYour years testing the soil underneath the see if you think that soil will drain the or not so if you've dug enough holes in the mountains of Arizona you kind of get a feel you just know oh man\nThat jackhammers bans bouncing off the bottom of that all the same never drain your were digging a big bath tub here if that's a case will take the Jack hammer and try to fracture\nThat soil underneath so we break it up so the water will search seeping into the next soil band underneath the roots of that new tree you need someone that can make some calls like that\nAnd and you're going a lot lighter so I'm going to be thirty and she's going to be sixty Seventy inch wide hole because the roots goes sideways they don't go down\nAnd so you're digging a hole sideways\nAnd pulling out the junk the anything bigger than a golf ball\nOf of old roots and rocks you'll find bricks timbers of the builders Chuck can buried in the front yard you want to pull all that stuff out so you're left with a screen it are screened\nType of soil and other routes can go through that then you want to men that steak it and get it going there's a technique to planting the main thing the reason I don't plan to larger plants in my own backyard even though I Am very capable I Know what to do\nI meet the planting crew out there with cookies and tea and water and um I'll pop a chair and kind of guy that this is a Great Hey guys what you do and how what you're doing this weekend I'll I'll converse with them but I'm not planning on it because it's too heavy I've had to back surgeries\nI Can't feel my right foot it's hard to mountain bike with it 'cause it's kind of like going around I don't want to injure myself any more uh so I have anything over let's say a Fifteen gallon size plant I have to plan to do it\nAnd it's worth every dime I mean that price at our place everyone has a different way of of charging for that sometimes it's just the labor just have a guy's power and\nThrow the plant in the ground and leave so their prices pretty inexpensive hours includes everything\nSo we're throwing the ... the food the stakes the fertilizers the the root and grow I'm into I mean everything more more time and the whole so half of that cost typically have had at least the friends I hang out with their own garden centers\nThey are about half that price has got to be the product all the stuff it takes to plant it correctly\nAnd then the rest of it's going to be it just as expensive to roll guys on a truck and heaven bland and get all the stuff out and go plant to just take the time for the people to go do that it's not free you need to pay for but it's worth it for a big plant is specially\nIf you've got a gardener sometimes you're more and blow your maintenance guys they don't necessarily know that much they know there's leaves that dropped on your crushed granted any new blow it up they do that much\nBut how to plant an actual tree may or may not there you might like like if you're buying a plant here waters garden center we have these planting guides\nAsked for the planting guide when you go to your nursery that tells you exactly how big the hole should be\nHow many stakes were they should be placed\nHow much how much food it tells you exactly in proportions might ask for that one of those sit down with your camp chair where they're going to plant this thing give the sheet to your to your gardener your maintenance guy ... take 'em cookies take um some\nThing to watch with your containers since this is a container sounds like container questions [noise] make sure if you're gardening through winter\nThat you water those plants if you get a a cold snap that seats in January and the weather is going to oh my God it was just going to be a big storm is going to be a cold wind people run to the grocery stores and they do the shell and they go and they hunker down and they hibernate per week all the storm passed as if you see that kind of a dent\nMake sure that your watering your plants before the colds comes a hydrated plant will go through that cold snap no matter how cold 'cause it's got it's got as moist so the antifreeze within the structure of that plant can move back and forth if it's a dry plant and just kind of counterintuitive\nIf it's dry you would think oh it'll stay warmer wetter ... it'll start shivering if it's wet no plans don't shiver only we do you do hear you keep the that that moisture in that plant especially container plans because they dry out a little faster\nThey drained faster it's easy to grow and um because of all those factors but the\nYou just want to make sure you're moist knows those plants up so they can take that cold\nA mix you put them up against the house it takes a little pressure off but er an altar magnolias evergreen beautiful southern magnolia that takes cold it takes the coals don't worry\nAbout it just keeps driven with that we're out of time we'll be right back with more on the mountain

have three dimension hero show on the talk of the plot that he'd take you in a\nMood and leave\nHas ... waters garden center\nYou're listening to the mountain gardener with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but with Ken hipster things are named five you'll read huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner no fall\nIs the absolute most important feeding of the entire year\nThis is if you're only going to feed once your landscape you should be doing it more than that but if you're only going to do it one time and then ... what the landscape starve the rest of the year this is the one you do not want to miss\nThat didn't go over the different kinds of fertilizers and I'd start with fertilizer steaks and that sort of the competitors are making the rounds making sure we're\nIn the marketplace competitive some going out there's lots of fertilizer steaks deep hard\n... spikes that you can drive into the ground and they're supposed to last year\n... don't use those top selling those Twenty years ago and here's why in the mountains of Arizona we're in very alkaline water and and rocky soil that that fertilizer steak will actually stay there for a year or more\nOf that so it's a slow to release the problem is where are the main routes on your plants it's almost impossible to find out\nAnd so if you had a lot of top soil and that that bubble around that fertilizer steak were to permeate seep and in a week away and and and actually fertilize a larger area of volume of soil it would be okay\nBut first of all they're expensive because of the number that you need to drive around a larger tree it's just it's just a difficult one doesn't do it you're going to need ten around a big Arizona cypress are big spruce or a big maple you didn't need more ... and then where do you play some\nYou'd be better off crushing that thing up\nAnd sprinkling that underneath the can of beer the drip line of that that tree or that shrub than you would to drive it in the ground because at least then to that granular that your ground up would would slowly permeate breakdown go through the soil the plant will pick it up and you've got the entire\nAh that tire radius or underneath that drip line fertilized properly\nThat's called a synthetic fertilizers these are chemical based up petroleum based typically chemical fertilizers Scots\nLes ... of fertilizers Scots and somebody's or does these these brand names or Arizona there's several of them that are chemically based there they're they're made from petroleum your sprinkle those things around uh basically\nThey released when water hits them go underground and then fertilize the plant that would be better than a spike because at least you know where it's going to go the negative\nThey released too fast so within a month\nAll that fertilizers pretty much been released with the reins gone into the soil and sometimes it's in a form of the plant can receive sometimes it's not so ammonium ... sulfate is better in the summer ammonium nitrate are better than the winter so sometimes plants can pick up [noise]\nBoy I didn't want to go this deep into fertilizers but basically it's temperature related when it's cool\nThe plants can pick up certain kinds of food and they can't their summer foods so it's kind of like a burgers and dogs that's for fourth of July weekend but I ain't going to have that outside of the yard when it's a you know twenty degrees out\nI'm going to have steak and potatoes or chicken soup\nAnd so really that's the benefit of\nAn organic fertilizer or all natural so we make of it made a fertilizer years and years ago ... huge following go all purpose planted not a very original name but it's seven for for all natural the main ingredients are\nCaught in the seat meal which lowers the ph as a nitrogen source\nBird guano it is to put a bag it's got kind of an earthy smell is televised so it's easy to spread but smells are the because of those cuts the meal and the and the bird wanna sulfur iron some other stuff so that's the same greeted\nAs those organics break down they break down much slower over a very long period of time typically about three months\nSo it's not releasing all the food at once and so the plant can pick up more of that food then let's say an organic would just release all at once is picking up parts of it the rest of it it flushed away and gone that's synthetic an organic to plant can pick up virtually all of the fertilizer\nAnd use it so you get less waste ... longer a feeding than you would a synthetic I highly recommend using organic organic granular fertilizer for most of your plants out in the landscape\nIs kind of like it's like an antibiotic I mean it's going to make the plant hearty healthy it's like chicken soup for the soul that's what an organic fertilizer is\nSet in the in the fall of the year if you've not done that I cannot emphasize this enough the benefits for the mountains and it's because you folks in the mid west you poor folks from the mid west you just don't you eight foot of topsoil you no longer have\nWe've got ... millimeters isn't any topsoil and your landscape and then we we put the fabric over top of the soil and then we put rock on it to make sure no organics ever get down into the soil again\nYou're going to have to fertilize more often up in the mountains of Arizona just because our soils we just don't have a lot of top soil\nSo you need that's where the nutrients are held you have to fertilize it more often so I suggest to three times a year minimum four times if you do if you have a lot of evergreens\nUh it'd be Easter do you think holidays Easter fourth of July and Halloween that's when you fertilize New Years for lots of Colorado spruce Theodore cedars pines and then\nUh I Would say for your your native evergreens they would greatly benefit from fertilizing with that all purpose plant food and anything that stress to also give it soil activate or this is like a this is truly the antibiotic for for plants things are stressed by\n... right and I think a lot of people don't even think about 'em but they're another tree\nThat has very susceptible to over water yeah that's true so planted get rooted and then to collect it and watch it grow [laughter] don't neglect it too will yeah [laughter] so it it is a good time to come to look for if you're thinking about living tree for Christmas maybe\nUm I Would say don't wait too long because I think they're going to go fast this year\nYeah I think we're in fact the team is going to put together a\nLiving Christmas tree kind of package kind of thing you could give to as a gift to someone we were selling more living trees and we do cut trees anymore so we saw hundreds of cut trees of Christmas trees in December will this is the producer the front load for a living trees living Christmas trees evergreens now so it's a good\nTime you can pick off the fence was asked so yeah that's

mounting gardener host Ken Lay and I this one of the beauties of having a garden center here in northern Arizona is especially of Prescott we kept the most interesting people that live here and they come in they shop plants and you get to talk until many oh\nThat's a great story we have to capture that on there and so I've got two gentleman a John Murphy and Daniel Blake who are locals there here don't want us there kept it's great to garden\nVision great garden projects going and I thought you would take an interest in that as well so welcome John welcome Daniel glad you're here in the studio thanks for having us I guess so so now this is the make one hundred healthy foundation now that caught my year\nIn a in a time when you're jalapeno peppers are coming out of Mexico with the coal I all over him and then you put them into Safeway or\nFries er Cox wherever and they can kill you and this happens two or three times a year\nThis is becoming a problem the mat massive agriculture your goal is bringing local\nAre absolutely we want people to bring back the art of backyard gardening mogul gardening and why it's so important to get your nutrition from food that you can control it strikes really not just the luxury anymore and the whole idea of backyard gardening\nWas a big thing back in World War two victory gardens were a patriotic duty but they went away and now we have forty percent obesity so or make one hundred healthy foundation mission\nIs to help fellow Americans grow one million organic vegetable gardens over the next five years and we're kicking off right here in ...\nAt right here a lot of us who have been these things don't have that usually that's New York city or Chicago or someplace so now you've also got so so then you make one hundred healthy foundation has got this goal but then you partnered up\nWith Daniel Blake which is an old friend we've been going back decades I Know I Know the gardener\nAnd I know Daniel you have traveled the world helping people farm better smarter roaming in third world countries that's been your passion now you're back home and your partner with John you're going to share that expertise with is how does that partnership work\nWill can uh when I got the opportunity to leave the country was always because there was a great need newer children there were sick and they needed to have better food so I had an opportunity to go down and teach now I Want to do it here\nLocally so that's perfect so now you're just set up gardens\nAnd then you're going to bring your expertise it'd be like you've been smarter than I Am as far as gardening do you can make things he could make that microphone restricted to put it in the dirt\nYou're going to health over here and help us to start growing around foods here here locally that try what do you do that a little gardener backyard garden yeah so how does what give us tease me what what's what's something that maybe we can do in our own backyards a list are\nOver ... fly could could use right now they would maybe make their game their guard game a little better well can I get\nA closer to the soil and I started digging the toy with a digging fork and I start adding organic matter to it and gypsum and other minerals to make it alive\nSo what kind of organic struck horse manure use chicken coop used gypsum or fertilizer with what ... what do you dig in would that fork and what happens when you hit a Boulder a dig around and move it [laughter]\nI was just sharing earlier or the ... with the audience we just bought a Seventy pound hammer for the for the planning truck because the rocks are becoming their like growing or the where people are building are on ... more and more it seems like there's less oil there it's hard to grow things without the soil\nWell I Would add a gypsum is important because uh all the nutrients piggyback onto the gypsum and to the calcium to get into the plant they got to have the calcium and now they write form of calcium for Arizona soils and then I had organic matter\nAnd then I started adding a nitrogen and phosphorus potassium and I worked ... get close to it I had an ear to the soil\nSo is this square foot gardening or is this row gardening or how would you prefer if you want to maximize let's say I've got a back yard and I'm only going to have a hundred square feet of ten by ten area raised bed\nGoes up I don't have any other soil elsewhere so I made it out of the timbers or black or whatever how ... how would you what would be the formula to make that go\nFor and you were not formula well let's just say ships that would not want to use the natives soil 'cause that's not good stuff\nIs well that's true some of it isn't very good but then some of it is so different parts of Prescott have clay and most people don't like to dig and clay clay holds your nutrient veteran hold your water longer true so I got to do there is admired ... matter to it and that kind of makes it yeah sweet and healthy\nAnd what's your favorite plant grow what's the most uh see your third world country you're helping wherever you helped grow or help third world community is\nEat better Mexico Billy's hunters and Africa gotcha well okay so to countenance looks pretty good and growing pardon the pun now you're going to third this is not there were there were third world but\nYou're here in America helping us grow smarter that's right what was the main crops that they like to grow their\nSo rice and beans or or what are they mainly doing they grew every vegetable you can imagine yeah that's absolutely gotcha okay not just tomatoes yeah or I was thinking peppers or something like that there is a spicy\nPepper that I Love and Mexico so good so we've got an event foundation coming up to a new kind of
