number is named his book anything outstanding poster with CBS what do you think about what Jeff Flake just said\nYou know it's interesting and I and I talk about this some of the book uh myself in this this\nAnimosity between the right and the left wing Democrats and Republicans I'm ... ... it is they're Hmong ... among a group of people who are really ideological and really passionate about politics\nThey see the other side as you know we've we've done pole and they see them as a threat they see them as different from they are the sides politics um I mean everybody\nYou know that's not everybody there there is a middle in that regard there are people who are just tired of the back and forth want sensible solutions you to Prague\nAmerican citizens or politicians do you think these politician should have more courage that they had in the past be willing to lose their feet in order to do what they think\nIs right well you know I look I I don't know what the politicians are thinking but I Do know this\nCampaign seem to make a choice between whether they think it election as a base election which means you've got to go out and get those most fervent partisans get them out there for doing persuasion election and they look at the numbers and they see that people are getting harder and harder to persuade\nSo you understand why these campaigns go after and now the other side's Tibet you know the bad folks and we've just got to mobilize our own\nAnd that may contribute to it I I Will tell you this real quick Bryant you know we just did it as part of this poll asked a question or the party's arguing about\nThe kinds of policies they like or dislike or the kind of people that they like or dislike and most of the parties and saw the other side is arguing about people that they like and dislike as opposed to policy\nBoy that that's hard to educate yeah that's that's that's hard to negotiate when you when you become very very personal and I think there are a lot of Americans who have a reaction against that top three issues that matter most to your polling for these midterms um healthcare keeps popping up yeah health care no matter how many times we get healthcare keeps popping up\nThe direction of the country generally and I will tell you this you know the president a either a pro or con is shaping up to be the biggest factor for a president\nThat we have seen in mid term typically it's a majority a little more than a majority who say they go to the midterm vote with the president on their mind to 'em but we're looking at record numbers for the number of people who said that this year both foreign against both right before and against\nThe most intriguing race or some of the New Jersey determined as to who we had a hung jury that kept him out of jail and he was censured by the Senate\nWe we wish we did pull that race and we had Menendez up but you know here's a case again where you've got partisanship New Jersey to blue states so people break along party lines and a lot of that seems to have been put aside there were people who who aren't thrilled with with what a senator Menendez is done on board voting for him anyway in that regard but\nThat it helps the Democrats in places like that are hard to places like say Missouri\nLast week Florida Senate race notes in search Scott yeah was that hurricane done for Scott do you think you couldn't have pulled it yet because you in the middle of trying to help yet\nThey haven't pulled it yet that suspicion is that questions that we'll ask is you know does that give Scott a chance to look like he's doing something to act\nLike an executive often times you know natural disasters do give somebody in power a chance to do that so that'll be one of the key things will walk I Know but you look at it the daddy virtually have probably is I think the high governor's race there probably helps boost turnout that puts a bit of a wild card and it was just and give them yeah the mayor of ... and that's\nOne that is one we are all going to be watching by for a lot of research says the idol I applied there for sure if he tried to get some rest of his book where did you get this number\nWe would you have voted for cabinet\nAbsolutely I Believe Kavanaugh as an objective jurors and uh everybody who's um who's tearing them down a a don't don't know the man I I'm looking forward to a place in Moore I'm a a tax\nA a place in Moore I'm a ... Supreme Court justices on the bench and not just a but not just in the Supreme Court but around the land because I Believe that journalists insurers have an obligation to be objective impartial and protect the constitution and also to make sure that we the people are informed the trans parents to buy\nTwo we're speaking with John James who wants to be the next senator from ah Michigan replacing Debbie Stabenow and we'll see where that goes because they'll Mitchell poll that just came out a ... on the seven\nUh how'd you cut a deficit from Eighteen to nine and we know they do at your energy we know that John junior is coming out there correct\nYes a darn junior will be out here ah tonight we're having a rally with him kid rock ... oil uh and uh we're gonna have a great time if you'd like to learn more go to my website John James for Senate dot com will also be streaming live on Facebook and Twitter at John James I'm a\nFelt I Want you here with congressmen and maybe future speaker Nancy Pelosi said about the president's push to build a border wall especially in light of the caravan of over a thousand people were heading toward border cut Seventeen\nAnd\nAll over\nThe world\nAnd then I\nThink it is a man who the issue\nUm I I think that ah that's ridiculous I the the president's job is to enforce our laws in this Nancy Pelosi's job to make the laws if she doesn't like the laws are in the book is her job to fix them and ... and and and and to legislate\nAnd she is basically campaigning on issues that she's created\nUm we need to secure our borders I Believe that legal legal immigration is a moral and economic imperative for this country by illegal immigration must be stopped Nancy Pelosi is part and parcel to the problem\nAnd she's refusing to solve it because ah for her own political gain we need to send people to Washington who are more intent on keeping us all safe\nWho are intent on upholding our values as Americans\nAnd not continuing to to divide us ah like Nancy Pelosi and and the establishment politicians are doing\nHave you dealt a John with a race issues in your life\nUm I I have I I have my mom and dad\nAre taught me or that I Would need to be twice as good to be considered half as worthy until I I've always uh endeavor\nTo uh to do my best or put God first ah and to serve my country and that's what I'm doing now I'm like I said before that I just have a future good friends are the folks who uh who just don't know me yet\nAnd I'm going to show through my actions that it's not about black or white spell red white and blue and I'm looking forward representing us all very well\nDo you think we're getting better at this as a society as a country uh judging people equally not on the color of their skin\nOr I think that um if if we are backsliding it's the um the political prejudice and beginning to see\n'em you have a this political prejudice people are beginning to assume they know exactly who you are because we are or the deep by your name when I went to Iraq I didn't fight for Democrats or Republicans for Americans and so people are\nAre assuming that uh that uh uh that they know who I Am and what I'm all about just because of the party I'm running and I'm an independent thinker too many people have died from it have the right to vote for myself\nAnd we've outsourced our our thought process it in in our ability to to vote in lead for ourselves to a political establishment that cares more about getting re elected than representing the people a part of the American dream is not only being able to elect our leadership but also the dream of being leadership\nWe have in the system right now in this country where the only way you can be a U.S senator is it your super wealthy or if you're a super connected if you're a political politician group politician that's wrong and I think that people are are are are getting Americans against each other\nA ... and and then blame the other side when things get done our country is in the throes of a generational change and the Dems and liberal media wants to keep talking about um\nAbout things that continue to inflame a and I'm looking forward to bringing us together because I've seen what what a partisan and sectarian divisions can do when I went over to Iraq Sunni fighting Shia cousins fighting cousins\nA we have a history in this country a family fighting than when we cannot go back that way\nAnd so yes we still have a racial tensions racial divides we still have gender issues and gender divides but despite our issues we're still the best country in the face of the planet and can't forget all American\nBut not perfect but trying to be and fighting along the way and lastly I think the United states is deal out of race Asian Cook County west came over Jim Brown came over to the White House did some stuff in front of the camera\nAnd then people are saying they kind of a West is is being used by the president as a sample that he shows he's a racially tolerant but he's not what is your reaction to what what what on last week as it came to it came to gang issues and race relations in America with this with this White House\nI think that anyone who who speaks out it just goes to show that are Democrats aren't interested in diversity of thought they're interested in getting people in line are telling the party line because uh\nUh ... it's ridiculous um we in this country I mean I remember being raised to believe that uh everyone was entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts but now the Democrats are you saying that every once in titled fast but knock it on and\nUh I'm looking at breaking down a bit the shackles that that that chain of dependency and victimhood and I believe that um by reaching out to the communities people selectively forget that are that the president\nUm has a has forgiven millions of dollars of debt to store who black colleges and universities they tend to forget that the president has met with the other presidents of those universities um and reached out to them where I'm not even sure that the previous president did\nUh we need to make sure that we take a look at the the underlying issues\nOf income inequality and get to the root cause which is opportunity inequality and having those honest conversations because in in these areas\nAre these are the places that are that the progressive liberal policies failed Americans overwhelmingly where minority African American we need to have these conversations that we need to change now I can guarantee one thing I'm for the state of Michigan or if Debbie Stabenow stays in office nothing will change we need to make sure\nThat we end her reign of hyper partisanship\nWe incur reign of ineffectiveness and we end her reign of broken promises I'm looking forward to representing Michigan\nUh and uh I Believe that among African Americans specifically we need a seat at the table when Ninety eight percent of us do it in one party been neither party feels like they have to work for your vote we have been a silence we had been ignored and\nNow when you got to see that both tables because righteous indignation is not going to change things right just influence will\nWe have been marching from Selma to Detroit we been writing from lots to Baltimore and nothing's changed in forty fifty years we need to make sure that both parties work for a vote and we have a seat at both tables so that we can continue to push changed now\nI remember I hosted a show with Jim Brown out an X ray all sports radio and I was we were talking to\nSo you already all sports radio and I was we were talking to get all of these calls about black coaches by general managers he said forget that we need black owners and then then you'll have somebody in power and then they're black or you're going to pick the people are going to get the most wins and that's what you should be looking for it not for any you know go out and you know go out and get it\n[noise] you know and that's the thing and I love that Jim Brown said we need more black owners but the thing is African Americans have been have been rolled into the sense that not only should we accept mediocrity but we should expect that\nUh you take a look at not just an NFL with the coaches and the and the and whatever but we need to look at owners and you see that right now with what they're saying a Fifteen dollars an hour why are you telling us that we only should expect Fifteen dollars an hour winds are teaching my babies how to make Fifteen hundred dollars an hour why aren't you\nAre doing the things that it would take to poll entire communities out of poverty by by\nActually uh um incentivizing people to get married and keep families together rather than saying but hey if you're a single mother and you get married somebody making the same amount you could lose your benefits bats incentivizing people do things\nAnd we need to have these conversations because we need to bring everybody up not just black or white but everybody because these are issues that all of us face but disproportionately speaking\nOr African Americans who've been forgotten\nI'm looking forward to working for everyone but particularly those who've been categorically forgotten\nJudge James you're exciting candidate and I have a sense a I have a sense is going to

with that Middle East nation even despite we'd Goldberg's at\nThe numbers\nWhen it comes to the curb and I as I said last night the president needs to work on Mexico Mexico needs to stop them on their southern border not in not instrument transit users and turn around right now to southern abortion you don't get to the United states\nOr they go and that of course it's Thomas Homan on Laura last night the caravans coming dozens of people from Central America demanded to be let in but first I got to get through Mexico and a few other countries what the president saying to those other nations to stop them in their tracks\nNumber one I mean\nI keep hearing about the enthusiasm blue wave but I think we have tremendous enthusiasm and we've been energized anyway so we're more energized since justice cap it off\nAnd I don't think anyone doubt that but it will be enough that will sustain twenty days and counting and we will have a second verdict on the Trump Republican hero and guess who is setting records already in their quest to be reelected in twenty twenty I'll let you know what's already been done a first things first I Would like to inform you that one of the big stories right\nNow is on Fox News dot com and most websites and that is that the Mueller probe will will announce the bulk of its findings right after the midterm elections\nAnd that will be fascinating because we do not know where it's going to go we do also don't know if the president's going to be speaking to Robert Mueller we do know this and I'm thankful for it I'm more has kept a low profile and dare I say stop work until the midterms they unlike James Comey did not want to play a role in the midterms so\nDown on drug cartel well apparently informed border\nInto our neighborhood\nAs your

governor of Connecticut Bob ... and a Bob I had a chance to meet and Larry Kudlow those big birthday party\nAnd Bob you're doing something you're trying to pull up the impossible but the Republican and run the state of Connecticut you within a year in single digits you down to a point difference how do you go to the rest of the way\nYeah actually there was another call came up there but they found a five now and uh you know we've had forty years of democratically controlled legislature eight years of a democratic governor to raise taxes\nIncreased regulation or grow big government people are ready for change here that's why in a traditional democratic state uh we've got a great shot at winning uh\nWhere are you going against a Ned Lamont famously he won the nomination over a Joe Lieberman but Lieberman independent one independent and beat him and the general feeling out at you not only going against the Democrat yoga is a liberal Democrat\n[laughter] yeah I'm actually happy about that because he has come out and said it's going to put a coke on the highway there are other tax is going to raise taxes across the board is going to end to the state wide auto tax\nAnd people are tired of it but they they weren't paying 'em they look at me as the ape and they're paying a worker clap her\nAnd Kudlow on an economic plan for Connecticut to get rid of the state income tax lower the corporate tax and get this economy moving again\nYeah you have a five year plan to rebuild a to rebuild Connecticut she just gave us a couple of those ideas and you think it's going to take how many years to get it done and what else are they ... what else in your plan\nWas a couple of things we can do it lately we've got we're the only state where the facts and an estate tax generates ... percent of the revenue for Connecticut and we've lost six billion dollars a taxable income here to the state of Florida so we're more money on that tax\nBeen ordering we can get rid of that they want\nA we have a plan to gradually phase of income tax over a year it'll be tied revenue triggers that will be tied the costs cut 'em but you know but why our current governor ... despite the two largest tax increases in the history of the state or tax revenue is down\nSo it's only carbon burn that we have to do to reverse get this economy going\nBy challenger Ned Lamont wants to continue more the same word it\nWas you know well in state you got to balance the budget every year now but I just don't know how to get rid of state tax and get rid of tolls\nOr how well we don't have calls right now so that revenue or not there um I Am step into a four billion dollar budget deficits\nWe've got to look at the costs going hard I was a ... or ... to to Europe but there are about everybody but we only added back in what they have to have it in a car so a lot of forty billion dollar better than your budget\nA cost out a lot of forty billion dollar budget Connecticut I got to be able to buy the Tucker use some of that money to the tax cut some of that money to invest in that case and get back into the economic policy at a state\n... he's with us about what kind of uh what kind of help to have you had you mentioned you got dark laughter and that's a big help and Larry Kudlow is a friend of yours what kind of help if you had from the White House any\nA Trump came out a way to the door of me after the primary\nUm I've never spoken though I Would rather err on the earth but other than a good thing or the Republican Governors Association says one of the top targets states to go Republican uh they've bought a bunch of at time\nThey've been supportive as they get a lot in the short order few democratic states that we have a real shot to go Republican governor\n\nBob chop it out there but Bob listen to his background is from a CEO of GE corporate finance prior to that he was the ... would you be asked you heard him mentioned that\nIn most recently he left the job a CEO of D. F. C. global so he's all about making money earning money and he also he's also about a business Bobby too with us\n[noise]\nAll right uh he's gone so if a businessman can be successful in the White House guinea pig settle in balancing the budget and bringing some physical sense to the state of Connecticut I Will say this\nBut most people I Know now my son works in Connecticut most people I Know are extremely unhappy with what's going on there and nobody blamed Republicans because I've had absolutely no power wouldn't have been a one man it was extremely successful as an executive in Connecticut or she couldn't break through a book out clause\nBaba she's talking about the fact that you were the c._e._o. of D. F. C. global last\nUPS you mentioned before that in or C O G O G A achieve corporate finance why would you want to put all that knowledge into trying to balancing or to getting into politics\n[laughter] it's a sucker close to my I'm a Connecticut God group and I went to public schools uh\nFor a local college Fairfield University it's still it's been great to me\nSo I've been watching it being ruined by horrible economic policy treat daughters\nTo coordinate to sixty I don't want to have to get on a clinician worker and kids at Florida ... um is all about the economy here\nI'd been restructuring businesses for Thirty years ago the political forty billion dollar\nBudget that needs to be restructured so let's go to my house and I just felt it was time to make the choice I'm fortunately for me to a recording or it's a year ago now it's turned to sort of recipes were already hurtful on all sorts of course our political do not want to politicians\nAre you looking with Charlie Crist political do such and such it's a great to be running for governor and\nStuff well I mean you got one resent Iran Johnson's one of the most effective centers are from business in of course the part of the United states are much of this year in many politicians are trying to run the government like a business is business where he's actually making a lot of decisions himself a Bob Bob Bob stepping us Keith thanks so much for joining us\nThank you for having me on a cruise I'd love to come around again record or let\nYou got it as he faces off against all about and tried to pull up the upset but the Republicans in Connecticut when we come back Jerry Lewis joined the market is down put your money doesn't have to be one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine will talk about the the power over all of this economy globally\nAnd now people are still a little nervous about what seems to be a\nA deepening fight with China when it comes to trade\nAlthough she and Trump will meet shortly to the brain kill me showed them\n\nWell yeah we're good at that when we know how to do right\nAnd be the president would say because I needed the money for defense the trade off on some of these social programs jury at some point maybe it's a re election of President Trump someone's got to go in there and a bipartisan Simpson Bowles way again at present some type of political cover way to make spending more sustainable\nSo you're saying no Medicare for all is that what you're telling me\nI mean that's one thing I mean I think that or maybe we'll do our judging even the defense department says we have enough missiles\nWe have enough right thanks so\nOkay so it's not really about defense it's really about the entitlement programs that's the thing that really drives us over the edge to the question is how do you manage that right\nOr is that about having people as they approach their elderly year's\nFall out of these programs or early I mean you don't you get into them later in life because our lifespan it so much longer I think that the closer answer but the idea of Medicare for all\nDoes not work and why did that work because of the money the dollars and cents we can't afford that and why why why would you at Tel corporate America to stop\nGetting your employees healthcare insurance this is a program that it's worked since World War two hundred and fifty three million Americans get their coverage through\nYou a hundred and fifty three million Americans get their coverage through their employer for the love of God don't put a knife in the back of that\nWell we love it a new school grade healthcare I Love it and if you will to visit to say I got news for you don't have to spend on health care they'll hire five you and say thank you very much\nI guess what the quality will go down nobody reinforces your Medicare they all need supplemental I Know that for a fact that's right and so that's for some people that was never meant to cover the whole country but there is a legitimate nonpartisan issue\nHealth care remains number one Jerry have you seen a model that works [noise]\nI think this idea that there is an easy answer like government funds everything is stupid\nAnd I think every market will have a different solution and for us I think it's a lot of different pieces of the pie coming together it can't be one thing it can't be just a big old governor fat government program that covers that that's like oh that's such a great idea no it's not\nI don't know how that works I Can't make that work in my head\nWe've got to get these companies to compete against each other for your health care dollars we have to and sent private citizens to know what they're paying and to complain when they're paying too much we've already got a program out\nHealth and Human Services secretary this week saying look we're going to get the prices on drugs down and part of the way we're going to do it is when you advertise your drug on the television you have to say how much it costs\nAs you're sitting there going to have exposure on just about everything starting the new year I heard the president's insisting and for the big form is resisting\nThat's right they don't want to do it they got their own plan it will be fine go to this website click five buttons goes ... will eventually will get you the answer to your question I don't think that's the way to do it\nI think informing people you know information is the key to this and getting these companies to compete with each other they're having you know success at the margin with small things that ultimately will make a big difference there more generic drugs coming to market their getting faster approval for drugs and this is all going to help\nYeah I Want you to hear what President Trump and tell me if you're comfortable with that said ...\nWhat ... is the fed because the fed is raising rates too fast and it's independent so I don't speak to him but I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going to fit because you looked at the U.S inflation numbers are very low\nBeing put on that I mean I had an airline I was going to be honest I'm not blaming anybody I put him there and made me a tour I may be wrong but I wanted to get it wrong I put it in a couple of other people do that I'm also happy with the algebra I'm very happy with papal\nShabby with people with a guy there is going to remarry can't do anything about it you know fire it out but he has a point how are you really do them all the time evidently he used to scream about the fed where we were all going to be okay but it does it bother you at all that the fed might look at it as a become more of a political Oregon that everything that they do raise rates would not have\nTo become a political Oregon all they do with ignore him that I mean that's all they have to do and that's probably what they will do but I think he's got a point\nI think that we may be at you know look\nInflation not an issue right now right\nAnd the presidents looking at camping down the growth of we have why would we want to do that at this point\nI think the fed overreached when it said we're going to look at two things not only are we going to look at and ... not only are we going to look at inflation but we're also going to look at interest rates were to look at these jobs are going to charge the fed has no business looking at jobs in my view and that was the decision they made like two presidents ago\nSo here's the part of the United states moments ago speaking with Stuart Varney on trade with China cut fifty one I'm going to stop talking with China again we're all very ready for you\nI don't think so and then I told them they want to make a deal and I said you guys are idiots you're just not ready because they've been taking five hundred million dollars a year out of our country it's time that we used to [laughter] okay we rebuild China you know that rather than anybody you talk about it more than I Do I say\nAnd it stopped and you see what's happening with China's a whole different ballgame so now they're paying a twenty five percent tariffs or two hundred and fifty billion dollars hasn't affected our economy housing costs have gone up inflation so low\nVery low hasn't had any impact that we see except for one billions of dollars are pouring into the treasury\n[noise] so um do you dispute that fact to terrorists are bringing billions of dollars into a to a treasury because I've heard that that's just beautiful\nWell what I dispute is that it has no effect on prices we've already got companies warning that they're going to have to raise prices because of tariffs that's already there I'm Sorry if I add ons dealing on\nSteel also and in other in a Proctor and gamble I mean like mainstream and when you get a chance they have cancer and when you get into the language\nOf the terrorists it's going to be food stuff there's a lot of stuff you pick up at the grocery store okay those prices are going to be going up you know the reality is a lot of stuff you would buy to put under the Christmas tree which those prices were probably locked in in the summer\nBut stuff that you might pick up Tuesday night at the grocery store may go up to him right\nOr the jury you know how he's using it it's pretty obvious he's using it as a way to get you to the table I'm going to punish you with it and get you there I'm going to take your car away and then ask you how much are going to pay to get it back to like you're giving it\nI think that's true I think what's interesting about that it's this is going to be hard\nWeighing in the president's favor the Chinese economy not doing while the stock market terrible you're unhappy with mark yeah you're unhappy with an eight hundred point and sell off on the Dow will go to China it's much much worse right\nUm so he's got a lot of things we're working in its favor he has to be able to rely on Europe he has to be ... able to rely on Canada\nOr next week how other Asian nations he's got to pull the world together against China super difficult it's a high hurdle but you know this is something that needed attention\nIt did and Chuck Schumer agrees Europe agrees Raleigh and they said Mr President why are you fighting with everyone wants to Korea Brazil or breaking up NAFTA European Union and little by little they've come into line\nThe framework for the use air but I'm not sure what's happened since evidently Japan is on is ready to be is ready to be executed in a good way of that deal but now if you can organize the world against China most of all the best of intellectual property that's the key isn't it and it's also\nUp to our businessmen not to be money hungry to the point where they sacrifice technology for their families but it's American security overall\nIt as well as American security it's also America's future right I mean basically what China has done and in that race of the turtle and the hair they've jumped to had Twenty years because they were able to steal our best idea and that hurts us and we need to stop that\nRight I Want to you with the with the president just told steward warning about cutting spending and regulation cuts forty nine\nBut we've cut regulations more than any president ever and you can go for years and years and it doesn't matter [noise]\nThere's tremendous regulations so we can be cutting still and we're doing is [noise] you know it used to take Twenty one years to get a highway bill\nYou know bad case but it would take Twenty one years we're trying to bring that down to two and maybe even one and went away if it's not like we're not going to improve soil we're not going to say Twenty one years to find out whether or not we can do it\nBut it's pretty much what he thought gee you've you've gotten reports too that he has legitimately cut the red tape and radio\nYeah I mean there's no doubt about it I mean all you can like there are studies that show the number of regulations that existed pre and a number of regulations that existed after and there are fewer and I really think that's why you see a these companies being so much more aggressive\nAt these companies being so much more aggressive\nAh and and going out hiring you know spending money because they know that this big weight on their shoulders of regulation has been lifted and that they can do more things you know when you know that the White House is on your side it makes life a lot easier you're not always on the defensive you're not always back on your heels trying to figure out how to fight back\nA Leslie did another businessman looks like he's going to get in the race Mike Bloomberg regret not getting in the last time or what kind of uh what kind of not politically but what kind of resume does he bring to the table that could give Donald Trump pro\nWhile he's a hugely successful businessman\nI mean massively successful without any nobody can argue with his track record with Bloomberg the Bloomberg Terminal I shouldn't be talking like this because we compete right against him but he has been an incredibly successful businessman no doubt about it he had a vision he executed he hired still many people are here in New York and elsewhere\nThat's tough he can get things done he knows how to get things done a better

ten percent in Nineteen Seventy does this have anything to do with the elites\nBut at the core of it I mean by the way\nThat's a disaster not simply on a moral level though I think it is but on a practical one narrow range of social science that make the industry to appoint children particularly boys raised\nIn a single parent homes by their mothers are much more likely to fail in school and to fail in life to develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than we're likely\nDid develop addictions to wind up in prison they make less than more likely to be divorced or have out of wedlock Joe themselves I mean there's there's no upside to this at all\nAnd so if you're running the country and you have an actual interest that long term success\nFor very concerned about this and you're going to do whatever you can to make it better Arlene the Republican Party so focused on marginal tax rate they don't feel that sort of the properties of evangelicals they can't get involved you know you don't want to sound like Jerry Falwell so don't say anything about it\nAnd on the Democratic side single mothers are the core of their face single mothers are much more dependent on government of course they tend to be overwhelmingly Democrat and so the last thing you want to do in the last thing they do do is is suggested single motherhood is is less preferable hum than\nUh raising children two parent biological household so I'm both sides are kind of a lie that unintentionally in downplaying or ignoring this problem meanwhile he's got the country that you say one other thing\nThere is no single Parenthood in my neighborhood I live in an affluent neighborhood maybe you do to get some of your listeners do\nYou know that it's like Nineteen fifty five and our neighborhood nobody gets divorced there no single moms on my street\nOf course not because the ruling class understands that marriage is the key to prosperity and happiness and said they don't practice death themselves their children don't practice it to really like divorce rates among rich people are very low if the middle of the country it's the former middle class\nThat is in in social disarray and this is a huge problem not attacking anybody I'm saying if you really cared about the middle class you would be doing whatever you could to make it easier for people to stay married and raise children intact\nSo okay there was a vice president Dan Quayle you may recall any spoke out about Murphy Brown a TV character who had a child out of wedlock and he was buried by the national

morning you're exactly right that is what happened I Would see from that moment until now so I can confirm you just said that that the conclusion they through but then you wake up one morning and you realize you know tax rates are actually I'm for lower tax but I'm not looking for her taxes but\nThey're relatively easy to change you just need a majority in Congress and the president willing to sign it what's very hard to change the culture and the structure of the family and if that's destroyed you know it takes you know generations to fix it if it can be fixed up their civilization will collapse\nSo Republicans\nKind of missed the actual story which is social issues are the issues you're on a me and your nipple society grow out of the kind of life you weren't living that's what they should have been focused on and because they're dumb and cowardly and they listen to the advice of a couple of overpaid and unwise consultants\nThey didn't do that and I think the smart ones regret it now\nThe smart ones or what they regret it now\nOh really no one one leads you to one lead you to think that\nWell because I mean you look around Washington and you know most conservatives in DC work at nonprofit think tanks\nAnd there are a lot of really great people and nice people who work at the same tax but they've consumed billions of dollars in contributions over the past forty years in America has not become more conservative and the smart ones are asking oh where do we go wrong\nAnd it's not that they're not smart or they didn't try hard or they didn't have the best intentions they did it the best intentions but they were focused on the wrong thing what's he should care about is the way people with the family is\nThe very center it's the adults in matters the court building block of everything and when that collapses there's no hope of doing anything positive so and they ignored that and I think they know that now\nWhere I ... I feel for me asking you this but I it's it's truly meant a lot of curiosity 'cause I saw respect you where do you stand on President Trump\nI think that\nUm well I mean just as an overview I agree with you know the the majority the strong with the overwhelming majority of what Trump said um I think ... genius I think you need to understand from crafts at Trump's genius is not in affecting policy change I don't think he\nHas control over the executive branch his portion of government I don't think he understands how it works I don't think he's going to learn I don't think he's good at getting his program through Congress I don't think Congress wants to get his program into law\nSo on that level trumpet is a frustrating president to watch I think that Trump's value ingenious is in raising the question that no one else was willing to raise you think about as a kind of clarity very simple clear he so he will say things like well wait a second you know we had\nNATO which was this great force for forty years but it existed in order to keep the Soviets were invading Western Europe the Soviets no longer exist so why do we still have NATO\nWell I don't know what the answer is that's a totally fair question and one that we all should have been asking since Nineteen Ninety One when the Soviet Union collapsed or why are we still on Afghanistan Seventeen years later or why are we allowing the south Koreans to cheat in this trade deal or why don't we build the wall like what's the answer speak slowly so I can understand\nThat his genius being brave enough and clear enough to raise the core questions that we ought to be debating long after Trump's gone those questions will hang in the air and my hope is that someone will answer them and solve those problems but first you need to you need to define what the problems are\nAnd I think the Trump has been really good at that\nAll right a final question because when I Know I Know your time is limited so you have on guests\nWho I signed a intellectually morally intolerable which is which\nIs gone [laughter] okay\nSo I just want to know where you see their name as listed on your program notes boosters who well how long do you think oh my God I Can't believe this or I dread this or you know what this is what I Do for a living and what the hell\nWhy put their names on that list so I'm I'm responsible for that and I just filed like literally a minute before I got on the show our story outlines for tonight's show\nAnd so I'm involved I'm there no surprises to me because I'm involved from the beginning to the end by the purpose in doing that is it grows out of my belief that you need to hear the whole argument\nYes and you do that during the\nYeah I Try and All right Dr bless you great to be with you and folks his mood and ship or something for your dog no\nAll the families of the earth will be blessed not all the individuals of the earth all the families that's the basic unit\nMelvin chair that I Want to bring to your attention is the ex chair one of my favorite product because I sit on it every day at work\nWhen I Am in the studio in LA that is the chair I sit on we have like twenty chairs I could choose that's the one I sit on the X three is the new one it's mind blowing\nPhenomenal chair if you have an office this is the greatest office chair I Know of\nYour employees will thank you which is nice and end up itself and you could simply try it out go to ... chair dentist dot com there is a thirty day guaranteed so cheesy to send back you do show no questions asked\nX chair Dennis use the code Dennis a hundred dollars off and a three foot rest ...
