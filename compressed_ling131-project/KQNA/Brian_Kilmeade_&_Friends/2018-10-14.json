says that he is the editor in chief of book in film globe\nAnd the author most recently of not coming soon to a theater near you so it was one of those people on there of course many many of them who tries to make a living putting words together\nAnd he says now in this piece that after the two thousands Seventeen World Series where he was living out of a desire to see a Dodgers game\nHe uh looked in the mirror and realize he was wasting his life and he says I've been sober now for eleven months I Do the same things with my time that I did before except the Seventy five percent of my life

my family stayed together somehow\nBut I've lost a ton of dignity and integrity intangibles that I may never reclaim it wasn't so hard to go cold turkey he says\nI had a couple of switching nights and that was it but it's easier to stay off the stuff because I don't live in a state where it's legal\nI can get we'd but it requires a few steps addicts and illegal states aren't so fortunate\nNow all of a sudden these same for addicts obviously it's tougher if you live in a legal status is all around you and it's advertised a few weeks after I sober up I took a business trip to California in my

wanted to call and say that I Am a former addict of marijuana I'm Still struggling with it um about sixty days um give or take a couple of relapses um you know\nIt's very true that when it became recreational and or California or even went out with medical but all the stories we're following around\nIt became so much harder to quit because every corner you look you find it and everybody talks about it that you know it it it's a good thing and it's helpful but it's really not because that growers\nKeep thinking it's stronger and there's really no regulation out there to stop them from making it stronger and don't regulations on what type of pesticides they use on the actual\nMarijuana but keep them fresh for longer so they can sell them at higher heart\nSo whenever I Would go into one of the marijuana shot everything was about making it stronger not about recreation or having a good time or medical it was only about Frank and to the point that they\nTried to convince you to go

use may pose a greater risk to the developing brands of teenagers than alcohol consumption according to a new study this week\nAnd by the way alcohol consumption for teenagers is a serious problem\nIt's it's one of the ... and of course there's been all this focus upon or how much Brett Kavanaugh drank when he was Seventeen and Christine Blasey Ford when she was his ... please we're we're talking about heavier usage of alcohol which can be very very destructive\nBut marijuana even more so the analysis was published in the American Journal of psychiatry and found the cannabis had greater short and long term consequences\nThan alcohol on four key components of teens\nMemory the finding greatly surprised researchers\nWe initially suspected alcohol would have a bigger effect said the lead author of the study of professor of psychiatry at the University of Montreal her name is Patricia Conrad researchers looked at for cognitive functions problem solving\nLong term memory short term memory\nAnd the ability to stop the habitual behavior when\nNeeded\nMarijuana had significant negative effects on all four of the study could not tie alcohol to negative effect this is among teenagers and by the way this [laughter]\nIt come this conforms\nTo my own recollections and experiences in college because what I'm Talking about okay if people were were teenagers in late teens and basically my freshman year in college\nPretty much everybody did beer that was the drug of choice and then all of a sudden boom it's a Nineteen sixty six sixty seven and marijuana and there is no question that the cognitive impairment particularly things like short\nTerm memory loss and problem solving\nThere were there were many people including one to three of the people that I ruined with where\nWas it was a visible problem if you could see it immediately wasn't subtle authors examine for thousands\nAuthors examine four thousand students and the Montreal region over four years starting when the average participant was about Thirteen Years old\nThe students took yearly memory tests and self reported their alcohol and marijuana use those reports were kept confidential\nBy the fourth year three quarters of the students and consume alcohol at least occasionally well only about thirty percent use marijuana regularly but the study observe more daily marijuana users and alcohol abusers the study found some of the marijuana as negative effects were lasting\nA particularly troubling finding young cannabis users may cause long term damage to a brain function\nAssociated with

in the financial industry she's going to be talking with us today about our partnership with gradient investments\nAnd also about the role of women in their own financial future hey good morning Mary and I'm just so pleased to have you here good morning Barbara and good morning Arizona\nThis is exciting you know we have with American financial security our insurance intact side but we're also\nAmerican financial investments are registered investment advisory firms and while Ron and I meet with clients every day we're not the ones that stay up all night long watching the news and trying to study the market\nThis is actually the role\nOf our financial team or a third party team that gradient investments Maryanne would you tell us a little bit about gradient investments and the value that you bring to our clients\nAbsolutely I'd love to great in investments is a registered investment advisory from winter to billion in assets under management\nIs that two billion with a B had yet to be okay\nWe are one of the fastest growing our eyes in the country yes and um we have been a growing primarily because we have a lot of satisfied customers we started with um a probably a handful of advisors around the country\nAnd we now have about two hundred of which by Ron Ron are some of our favorite [laughter]\nIf I can say that yes right here on the radio and what we've found is that people very back in the beginning tended to give us a little bit of their money and overtime they've given us more and more of their money because they've been happy with the performance\nSo we offer a full suite of investments and people tend to like us and that's why we were growing so fast\nNow we do with Grady and a good bit of business through the different portfolios that are unique to gradient and for people out in the listening audience portfolios can be designed by a number of companies and either tag team to an agency or kept\nIn house talked to it's a little bit Marianne were really excited about the fact that as a portfolios gradient has represent or can represent the whole world economy can you talk to it's a little bit about how you go about doing that\nCertainly so let me start by saying I Am a member of a team so there are fewer of us and the management team investment management team here in Minneapolis\nAnd we have quite a bit of experience in stocks election bond selection and investment management when you take into account the thirty five years from our chief investment officer when Schmidt has better than Thirty years from Mike banger our senior portfolio manager\nMy Thirty years of investment experience I'm a woman so I don't give ... [laughter]\nAnd then the young guy in the group has had sixteen years of a money management experience she put it all together and we have over a hundred years of experience in investment management uh across the team and this has been through a number of economic and market cycles and I think\nThat's important it's easy to be successful accidentally when the market is outstanding it's very\nDear friend animal when you survive and thrive through all the years of ups and downs that are very natural part of the volatility\nRight there are certain ... market cycles and we've lived through those and succeeded through those and so we've come to a suite of portfolios that we offer to our clients uh some of them are more recent but ah they're still based on our years of experience in the markets\nSo to address the global markets are we've always had some us centric portfolios church one would be like an income and gross a type of portfolio the G fifty and uh we've had a gross portfolio pure growth\nA but then a couple of years ago we layer down the chief forty eyes so that's the international or national piece of that yeah right and then in addition we have a I sold a distribution where we have our our portfolio manager who have a quantitative\nGlobal strategies so it's very rules based\nAnd uh it takes ... investment to different parts of the globe depending upon the price momentum measurements overtime as so in this way we can have that global exposure to wherever the momentum as best across the world\nExactly you know a little bit later in the show I'm going to ask you to talk a little more specifically about\nHow these portfolios were designed and maybe more importantly how they are analyzed and constantly manage because that's not really something that those of us at home and especially in retirement want to do\nNo I I think you know you can try to learn about the stock market's at any point in your life and that's a good thing\nBut we've really devoted our lives who stock and bond investment management and were team I mean that's not even a one person job to spend all of your day if that's what you really wanted to do\nBut we are team doing this full time all day long all week long every year every part of the year\nUm whereas in retirement a lot of people would rather pursue some personal interest some hobbies or if they have grandchildren and they want to spend time in activities with the kids so it's a good reason to give your money's over to a professional investment management team\nSo that we can be watching all those indicates\n... team so that we can be watching all those indicators all day long and make the decisions that needs to be made\nYou know I think that's so important and for those of us who\nAre trying to educate ourselves on anything whether it's taking up a new sport or card game or learning about investing in general\nYou have to start with the basic and then\nBe able to eliminate what you and I

want to see that\nUh is so just take your portfolio away from that a noise and just really let us focus on the tea drivers of stock prices\nAnd so that is analyzing the economy the economy of both the U.S and overseas and looking at the some sectors of the economy for indicators as to where we're going\nAnd where we see the rest of the year ago and they can jump on the Web and are and they can at

calling us at night to eight seven seven three six eight\nAnd were jumping right back to our third segment today you know the time goes so quickly I'm so thrilled to be with you Mary and and one of the things that you and I enjoy talking about is from the female perspective is we\nAre not a monolithic group by any definition women men told people short people were not a monolithic group but in general\nThe financial complexities had not been a go to place for women for careers for very long\nNo they haven't um but in actuality there currently fifty percent of women over the age of fifty who are managing their own money\nWhere they are because they're single they're divorced or they're already widowed\nAt that's a big chunk of those events out there who have been forced perhaps\nA or thrived because we were interested to learn about\nTo make our own money to learn about what we should do with it whether that's investing in our company four one K. whether that's having an IRA each year as we're working as we're trying to learn not only the business of our company so that we can thrive and succeed and earn more money\nThat how the heck do we go about planning for our financial future when we really I don't ... remember a single class ever exposed to me and my high school college early days in any kind of training that here's how to take charge of your financial future\nWell it's really important because that fifty percent number is only going to go up as we age yes it's going to be probably about eighty five percent of all women will be responsible at some point in there\nAnd of all women will be responsible at some point in time for their financial future so even if you're coming in with your partner your husband\nAnd you're trying to sort out what your long term strategy is it's very important for women to have a decent understanding because it's going to be in her lap in the end you know so a lot of women will just take a backseat to it and say\nYou know my husband cared for me and he's going to do the right thing and then they find out later on well he was a lot more aggressive than she would have ever been and that to a high risk stamps did not help her financial future\nRight or even things we talked to we did a show about three weeks ago where we talked specifically about women and some of the decisions that people can inadvertently make that significantly impact the\nFinancial well being of a ... a female spouse left behind and those are things like\nAnd perhaps in this case the husband has a nice pension they\nThey're going to he's going to retire and so they decide oh gosh I think we'll do a will get more money if we take a single life pay out\n... and\nThen the poor fellow doesn't last very long and that entire pension income which was intended for both of them for the rest of their lives\nThe way with him right right and it wasn't a decision that actually got made\nTogether and you know one of the things we teach people about when we do our seminars is we have the color of money risk at assessment tool that's really fun people enjoy and it's always a precursor to doing any kind of investment planning because it helps us understand how people feel about\nA performance of money and how much of that they're willing to lose mhm we always have both spouses if it's a married couple both of them do the color of money risk analysis and we usually say this won't surprise you when you\nDon't always agree [laughter] if you've been married and I know you don't always agree on what\nYou're spending money on or whether that's part should be saved that shirt should be invested what to do with it anyway so if you were being gaining\nAs a woman who never spent much time paying attention to finances other than we usually are the ones that pay the bail\nThings like that um\nYou know Social Security is a peach women need to understand more about\nA\nPension income\nInvestments for your sales\nYou actually did a seminar not long ago that was just for women rights what were some of the things people were saying to you where where what some of the interest percolating from\nWell I think the first thing is just as we were saying well he's got a certain a tolerance for risk but that's not my tolerance for risk um but what we've found it in many many studies is that\nAh women tend to shy away from investing I I'm not sure why um it is money and we're all going to need to spend it at some point but in general women can be great investors I mean they're pretty good these are generalizations but it doesn't apply to everyone\nBut women tend to be great shoppers they learn well from other women they like a team approach to things they are they tend to be risk averse\nTheir nurture so they're willing to be patient about things with ... they're not known for and women are also not afraid to say I don't know\nSo can you inform me and so they learn they but just in general um ... you you need to build wealth over time you need to set\nGoals timeline yeah the whole combination of investment strategy which will include as we talk about the color of our money will include some green income producing safe money some yellow income producing\nA gross options and\nDo better than just take care of our budget we talked to people about their hopes and dreams\nWhat do those costs and at what point in your life did those funds need to be available to help you not only pay your budget so you sleep well at night as you said I Love that expression but also be able to spend\nTime doing the things that your health allows you to do that you've always wanted to do and didn't have time\nRight right and by giving their money to a\nFinancial advisor to a professional investment money management team\nThey can know that the money is being actively managed\nWhile they're off doing those things that they really want to do you know it takes time to go visit the places that you've never been able to visit before it takes time to be with the grandchildren and be part of their lives it takes time to do all these other interests and hobbies that people want to do\nAnd some people have said well I'll just sell my investments while I go and do those things for a while and then I'll come back to it\nI don't understand that whatsoever if you employ an act of management team than we can know to just hold on to things for periods of time and we'll be looking for those triggers to sell them and reinvest\nBut we're very time sensitive and this is a long term plan but it's going to help you
