Yogi an American resident with three American Kids and you can't believe the farcical explanation fit to cops was one of the last ones where he walked in gotten a fist fight with twelve people died\nAnd now we have a whole either now or to one leader of oppressive turkey who was jailed some estimates are the two hundred journalists for writing things he didn't like\nNow being sanctimonious over Saudi Arabia there are no winners here joining us now is Congressman Adam Kinzinger who who fights are wars also a Adam is a retired air force pilot flew in Iraq and he joined the foreign affairs committee a congressman the president's remarks yesterday\nI I think he was waiting for the investigation of play up as he waited he answered directly do you want to counter it\nListen I uh first off your book was awesome I just have to say it I I finished in a couple of weeks ago and it was fantastic but let me just say on the ... the president is correct here he's saying\nYou know look we that's just terrible what was done this is absolutely wrong this violates all kinds of things he was right on the path here he was he was also correct\nTo be cautious at the beginning we need to make sure I mean there's there's people that want to jump to these foreign policy conclusions all the time and just assume that whatever is reported on some news thing or from some\nFor an agency is the truth when when it comes to international politics we have to be cautious and judicious but you know what really does get under my skin and all that says as you mentioned earlier on now it was the that's holier than thou defender of you know the Turkish version of the first amendment\nAnd uh and then you see even people in our own party and and the other party\nWho are calling for this like excommunication of Saudi Arabia Rand Paul Breslin says that let's just cut off everything with Saudi Arabia and at the same time yesterday called Millie story and relationships and lifting sanctions against Russia or killed two people in the u._k. and killed journalist all the time so\nThere's gotta be some consistency here and foreign policy and the fact is we oppose the killing of journalists but we're not going to realign are interested in the middle east because of it\n[noise] so are there to now we have the CIA director over there trying to get some answers because we basically give it up on the Saudis but how Richard said sarcastically is it for her to want to act outraged about the Saudis what do you think he's playing he's looking to get maximum leverage from Saudi Arabia\nHis economy's terrible he sees jealous of the relationship with God rekindled with Saudi Arabia who do you think about his comments\nI think you you never know where the wind\nComments well I think you know you never know where the wind comes down I mean it's kind of had an unholy alliance with Russia and other non oil alliance with Iran and then he says you against Russia and Iran issue down a Russian airplane this guy's allegiances change every day for whatever's going to give them a moment of power and\nLook Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two polar is right now in the Muslim world in the middle east and that bothers her to one he wants to leave the middle east and and uh and so I think he sees this as an opportunity in my estimation\nThat take Saudi Arabia down a peg to probably get some concessions from um including some economic concessions and re assert themselves those kinds of the dominant power in the middle east the reality is though he has no moral ground to stand on sure he doesn't murder journalists in the fashion of Saudi Arabia dead and again\nWe need to be very clear and condemning this evil back but he's not he's not you know some you know St Mary himself either we have a couple of hundred journalists in jail and we had a pastor in jail for goodness sakes off a sham trial\nA cartoon ... you know with a lotta times Congress takes the lead you guys did neuron during the Obama years what is going what is going to be the the backlash from the parent killing a brutal killing of cars Yogi what do you what do you guys talking about proposing [noise]\nWell this is where you get into the internal politics and I think it's important to talk about this you know some of these people that are calling for cutting up arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nYou know basically that strategic realignment of wave with Saudi Arabia or the same people that were doing it beyond before this even happened this has been their foreign policy goal like I mentioned Rand Paul he's always wanted to X communicate Saudi Arabia and frankly get us out of the world it's fine they believe that but I think it's important to know show\nYeah you're going to have these groups in Congress that have always been this kind of anti Saudi more pro rainy and they you know they loved the Iran deal\nThat are going to try to take advantage of the situation I think it's important for us to say things like travel bans on anybody associated with this surgery sanctions against you know the regime but at the same time we can't completely re aligned ourselves in the middle east away from Saudi Arabia because of this\nYeah I Know I was just struck by Lindsey Graham and Bob Corker to defenders of a re killing their relationship feel personally taken a personal front because this happened and you just wonder as brutal that says that it's nonsensical and you don't want to think about it why the Saudi Arabia I think they can get away with it that's what I find it following\nYeah yeah and that's where that's where I'm blown away is is you know this idea and this is why he don't suppress journalism pride it's because\nUltimately if you try it's going to backfire on you know the idea that the Saudis thought they could murder you know their own citizen but a resident of the United states in in Turkey is ridiculous and it's going to backfire on them and I hope\nAnd this is why I'm for pretty intense punishments on this because I Hope that prevent this kind of behavior in the future but again I think before you know everybody sits back and says gee we need to just you know cut Saudi Arabia off the map and become best friends with Russia and Iran and everything in Turkey but some of these countries do them before we will be all psyched ammonia\nYou're at reaction to the suspicious device as it were a route to Obama or Obama camp to Clinton house and now CNN\nYeah we don't you know we don't know who send them off all of that no matter what the situation as a I Wish we could just get back to having good spirited debate instead of confronting Mitch McConnell and Ted Cruz in a restaurant you say and you need to confront them at gas stations and fight people and push back to their face\nBecause ultimately are going to have you're just going to have a huge mess that does not good for our institution democracy\nThe congressman or how concerned are you what changes if you're in the minority\n[laughter] oh man everything I'm\nYou know sometimes you sit back and yet you imagine how Nancy Pelosi would be a speaker I mean imagine every Trump official in front of every committee every day\nUh being attacked and asked for everything and and ... and they were three of the Trump Administration and Maxine Waters of the chairman and Jerry ... Adler is a chairman I mean I really just it gives me chills up because you know\nAnd I think you know what does it do to the confidence of the economy people read the economy has grown ups because people feel free to take a deep breath and invest or if you got this Nancy Pelosi regime on the horizon a I think people are going to hold back so guys get out and vote even if you're a Republican Congress men\nGet out and vote for him or her because ah it's you're voting for Nancy Pelosi or somebody else\nPay a congressman thanks so much Adam Kinzinger a joining us ed I\nFollow the through suspicious packages as well as some of the investigation over the middle east Adam thanks when we come back we're going to be joined by Jason pretty close uses for to patrol years in the army and now is a whistle blower he knows the reality on\nThe border and knows what we can and can't do to stop the seven thousand [noise] care of any this way [noise]\n[noise] no it's not and you know that but that's the thing is the message the message is if you come here and you can claim I'm a refugee or asylum status because of that um then you should come\nOh I'm status because of that um then you should come now everybody I mean if you're saying eighty percent of the people are are male military age males coming up\nI mean how many of them have ill intent and how many of them have a background I'm In that same violence that they're fleeing and that's where the the problem with the borders going to happen is we're going to have to set out close to ten thousand people\nKnow you mentioned I was a whistle blower my biggest thing was about the whole vetting of these adults with children arrogant are we going to potentially have\nUm two to three thousand DNA gets ready to go and we're down there I mean it's just it's just going to be a complete mess\nAbsolutely use our quarter she's actually in Guatemala and this is what she saw cut Eighteen\nWe random people that were part of that he needed here try if there were other people well they're all very very different group or there was no one is now a mall we were there to greet basically the second way\nPeople crossing from Honduras Guatemala right on the border I can tell you what I saw were very few women and children and any more about it man\nThat's what you see and that's what's going to be at our doorstep how hard is it going to be to get that next the next nine hundred miles with a with a you know basically with sandals on\nIt they they can do it I mean believe me they can do it and I'm sure they're going to um there's trains that they're going to be running into soon ...\nUm there's other transit court orders I mean are they going to be linking up the smugglers there's ways to make it to the border it just depends on how much time do we have to prepare I mean if they're a thousand miles away we need the four deploy\nAssets down to ... an area that we have Fort Sam Houston is right there which is great big military base\nUm oh we need to really start moving assets in place the border patrol will get overrun by ten thousand people\nAnd they're helpless I mean they were almost victims in it because ... politicians can't get out of the way and also I saw you know we have Tom Homan who used to run I said do for the most part twenty percent of everybody they cross in as a criminal record\nSo you got to deal with some form of the people who are trying to mix in the Washington Post who I talked to two people that have been through five or six times and they're using the caravan it cover to try to get back again here\nWhy wouldn't they Brian I mean when I was in a border patrol um and when I was ... you know one thing is like when I was let's say it was an ... I caught a group of ten\nAdded that ten you could say at least you had a criminal history that was verifiable now what about people that do not mean vetting is great people love talking about vetting but if you've never if you're a criminal you've never been encountered by law enforcement then you're not going to have a criminal history so we don't know if you're in the area so I mean this is just it's mind boggling\nYeah here's a Mollie Hemingway I think she reflects the sentiment in this country Katrina and\nI think that a lot of room for an agreement on the immigration debate and you have people who\nYou know covered the spectrum there but the idea that there aren't national security concerns with immigration policy or economic ... parents with immigration policy it's actually just something that a lot of Americans agree on and when they see something like that and I can't imagine a better visual\nFor Donald Trump's argument that we need to have a care borders and orderly immigration policies and understanding of national sovereignty that that does not allow just literally the flooding of people over the border\nAnd it used to be unanimous I mean we have Harry Reid we have ... Obama Chuck Schumer all saying we have to border security jeez in this well you must have seen is what happened why it was only one party convicted on this\nI don't understand I mean ... ... I Believe both parties can agree that there are legitimate or refugees and a legitimate asylum claims within that group\nIt's the other part of the group that we need to be concerned about and it's not a it's not calling out I'm like hey you know called fire this there's actually legitimate bad people within a group I guarantee it um but I don't you know Ninety six is when it's all really started fluctuating\nFried and think about the border of San Diego you still get inundated with hundreds and hundreds of bailing just running up the highway and Clinton passed a law back then and that's when the ... of the border patrol began that's when it the ah mash hiring started channels\nSo you guys got a wall at a huge fence came to the war\nAnd that yeah that was fourteen miles long but what happens when you get to him a gallon where that fans only goes a certain point and I've been to the I was deployed to Idaho Arizona were all there was was a strand of\nUm a strain of barbed wire that's not going to stop anybody so let's say they meant let's say they are going to count at this point we don't know exactly where they go and that's just the closest water but what happens if they get to that other areas and then you also have the crisis of what happens if they start crossing the river and how many of them are going to die\nI mean there's so much to do with this and you got to remember one thing I brought this up the other day was\nThat the communicable diseases we have to not just only vet for criminal history we need to deploy a Center for Disease Control people down there a and FEMA tend to ensure that uh we're not bringing everybody across it has like a high fluctuation of tuberculosis or any other disease\nAnd lastly Jay too if you talk to anybody used to work with at the border is there any color you could bring to what their jobs like now\nTheir job is tough it's always optics optics optics are back in the day there was no cell phones are nowadays you're going to see one or that one at ten thousand seven thousand hits the border\nThere's going to be cameras hundreds and hundreds of cameras not just news but cameras from everybody in the world

I I Would think that would be a good idea for a President Trump to dispatch someone not in his government\nSome of the Saudis trust I mean ideally would have been George W. Bush someone like that but he's too old maybe Bush senior maybe a former ambassador someone they trust but to give them the no nonsense message you guys got to clean up your act and um and and and complete lastly or cut dirty takes President Trump\nIs sort of became a journalist\nAnd really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nHis critics say that's code white lies he says no it's America first I Want to put my country first right\nTo sort of does anyone think that President Trump speaks so subtly in code usually they they are attacking flipping bluntly right and like look\nI think ... treated the better word a it is parallel to the America First debate I mean I think the President Trump uses the word America First and the literal sense that most Americans hearing it means we're putting America's interests first\nOf course it as bad pedigree with Lindbergh and so forth I don't think he meant that I think nationalism sort of as\nA thing as any clue and when he realizes that people are misinterpreting it what does he do double downright drives everybody has the immigrants are going to buy the wall Street Journal you're on the editorial page thanks Bryant Bryant wrote tell next brain kill me Joe we're also following the packages\nThree explosive packages heading for a for a president of the United states\nI Know and and I mean we got to talk about this because it was about animals than anyone is saying that you know who lives here dies and who gets free tickets for Hamilton I mean that that's the questionnaire today with ... getting all free tickets I Hamilton\nWell Andrew Gillum the Democratic candidate who want it very difficult primary and he has shown himself now they will lead in almost every poll that's come out and today a new revelation\nYeah yeah I I think that I think it's gonna be closer than it is I mean the Santa's isn't Iraq veteran got really likeable I'm good looking family I my understanding is is that I'm the president likes him on and and you know the president\nWe had a very uh ingrained politician in our state and that and putting them\nAdam did not come out for the president during two thousand sixteen early Enron debt and present remembers that stuff so ... presidents oil is I think that's what's going on here I Do think the fact that it was going to win and again Gillum can't get out of his own way this this ticket thing is something that seems small\nBut voters again an eye for a quarter I think about it\nMessage emerge that show what he said on Sunday in a debate did he got him from his brother is just not true when an FBI agent posing as and influence or a text message Andrew Gillum and says I have you I've got new uh Hamilton tickets and he says great so those are the tickets\nUh Hamilton tickets and he says great\nSo those are the tickets worth hundreds of dollars you can't get that as a politician you can't get favors like that as a politician he seemed to have not told the truth about it and accepted it and it shows to the FBI agent is beating him to do this what does it say about the investigation that might be taking place on the Tallahassee mayor\nYet um well let me say this hundred dollars I it says in Tampa family things coming for the first time in a spring and it's over a thousand dollars for tickets thought oh was it a Broadway play yeah yeah well no it's a Broadway musical it's common so I'm\nPutting it wasn't on bravo and he's going to need\nOrange show I my understanding was that was the target show but the long and short of it is is that\nFor somebody like you know I'm In Tallahassee having the reputation is I mean take it out of politics we talk football at Florida State that its own problems with with a bunch of stuff there Tallahassee has become one part of Florida is looked at as\nOur swamp our microcosm on a swamp what I'd like to see and other people who support Republicans in the state would be to Santa's coming out stronger against the state swamp than the D.C swamp I think he's trying to hide in rather than the ground game which is important in Florida\nWell I don't think he's really outlined what he would do more he just points out that\nA Gilman reality once Medicare for all\nGilman reality wants upstate taxes humor reality is not doing a good job as mayor of Tallahassee what he has his great charisma great presidents and African American candidate\nWho ran a crowded pull because he was backed by Thomas dire and he was backed by George Soros so now you have a charismatic guy and you have another guy a veteran who's made a difference in Congress and he's been unable to separate himself because he can't believe these weren't even get somebody who's seems so anti Florida\nYeah ... and Brian look at going because it's when you say Medicare for all the state of Florida I mean we we have the economy I'm folks over age sixty five in the country we still do\nYou start talking about Medicare for people that are under sixty five yeah that scares a lot of voters and to your point the Santos has not explaining that piece to health care if you gave Medicare to all the folks that are living over sixty five in Florida right now there are Medicare their Medicare Advantage plans I work with health care businesses all the time are going to get diluted\nThat should be a major major talking point and you're right it's not being discussed in part of it is nobody really just gotten understands healthcare\nRight and it is remains the number one issue of concern caravan aside a scandal aside a healthcare number one we were in between the Obamacare plan which is a disaster that Democrats are running from and it being taken apart by Republicans who don't have a plan\nYeah and and look I mean it's in the news today with what the president's dealing with the Recovery Act that is a major band aid on the biggest piece of legislative malpractice and presidential ... malpractice I'll probably ever see in my lifetime and that was Obamacare why\nReally simple Obamacare for people that don't understand that it expanded Medicaid that was three quarters of Obamacare was expanding Medicaid Medicaid what's supposed to be for folks that were disabled had Down syndrome like my sister in law passed a couple of years ago [noise]\nSupposed to be for the elderly poor Obamacare opened it up to single able bodied mostly not working men\nUnder the age of thirty five what did they start taking if you go to a clinic that takes medicate and Florida and it's a pain management clinic in the last ten years tons of opiates so now they're hooked on opioids they're addicted on opiates and what's the president been left with and thank God it was a byproduct person piece of legislation\nThe oh the Recovery Act where you try to now get Medicaid coverage that's what this does to help these folks on Medicaid get off the opiates we got 'em all\nRight uh if you will in numbers like if we had Medicaid for all for a country\nBecause that's what Bernie Sanders is asking for a free education and Medicaid for all I mean do you have any idea how cautiously impractical that would be or impractical\nOur country right now it's almost twenty percent of our gross domestic product everybody knows as it is health care if you were to shift healthcare to medicate for all\nAnyone in the audience who is a Medicaid patient would be able to tell you the experience they get into the doctor it would be completely different than the experience of our listeners who do not have medicate today half\nIs a different type of medicine that's practiced and it's scary and nobody talks about the actual care compared to the numbers and the coverage right\nThe uh good pretty it was a primer hotel it they're not going to do anything that's going to sustain itself unless they work across party lines I suspect\nThought there might be a sense in this country right away for them to try to get a health care program on a bipartisan way because if you're a bipartisan as soon as you lose power that other for the other party is going to take it apart\nFestival in them and look what one thing that I can tell you that a lot of people really like right now are two things one ... Madison used to having an Amazon Prime subscription there's an ability to get that now in the country and get it a low rates and going to see a doctor and when you want to it's a free market private enterprise\nThe other thing that people really really like they like when their employers are doing wellness programs and giving them back money for staying healthy and saying in the workforce you'll hear about those things should be bipartisan\nYeah a health clubs are eating right things like that and a lot of times a day revolutionize the workplace to make sure if you want to stay we want you stick around and we're going to give you an idea what would be good for you\nYou know number one employer it's doing it nobody is talking about the apples actually got its own if you work for Apple in California they have opened up their own health practice you go to Capitol doctors while I work for Apple employees in California it's part of the benefit of working for Apple\nAnd I'm sure you book those appointments on an iPhone five on your watch are slowly or on your watch hey Brian great to see you or it was great to see Brian and Tampa we had to get through it's a great party because on the launch of on the eve of the launch of Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans it was great to see you in action congratulations and all your success and\nThanks Bryan and for anybody who hasn't seen the show I'm I'm Guy it's one of the most and lightning shows from an extremely humble person and Brian and I learned stuff about history that I never knew that it's not even in his books\nWe had a chance to talk about all the shows are of all the books in one state show all over the weekend too much for your support he brought a whole bunch of people down so Brian great to see you when we come back more than a suspicious packages at the President Obama President Clinton's residents are as well as a CNN this is a bright to meet ya\n[noise] giving you everything you need to do is Brian Gilmore [noise]\n\nCyrus ...
