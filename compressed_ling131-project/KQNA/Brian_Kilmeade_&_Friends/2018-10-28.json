C. A. [noise]\nHannah welcome back to hammer time brought to you by having pike county contractors association if you're wondering or if you just joined us where Sandy is she's down in the valley are attending a meeting with a registrar contractors on behalf of our association\nAlways working seven days a week\nSo uh you're you're struggling with myself in a couple of great guests this morning so we hope you'll and enjoy the show and stay with us so we were just in the process of meeting Mr mark the cherry a man's need a landscaping when we had to take a quick break so mark wants to go ahead and fill us in on the rest of your company\nMorning again my yeah so we started business back in two thousand nine and um we've been steadily growing sense then things have been going really good of course the economy has gone up turn right now and I'm keeping nights and busy\nSo two thousand nine you decided to jump right in there right in the middle of the downturn\nSearch kind of seeing the opportunity that there was there was work to be done and on a smaller scale it was just myself to begin with I mean we started with just simple irrigation repair and basically doing whatever we could do to keep busy and kind of get things off\nThe ground but you knew that the end was insight and that they are to bench Lee would be enough turn\nYes sir and it it has been it said it's good and it's bad you know I'm of course there's a lot of good work out there but we are having a little bit of a lack of workers\nShootings and we want to get into that because that's certainly a situation is not only plaguing our industry locally but is is a national issue and we can talk about some of the steps that are are association is taking and at the college is taking to try and and or intercede to help bring new people into the business\nOr the check why don't we go back to the two thousand two thousand four era two thousand six era a when things were just\nThere are two thousand six era or when things were just rocking and rolling so to speak and then all of a sudden we started seeing a downturn so describe if you would to our listeners that difference that you see between today's market and when we were booming back in the early to thousands\nIf you are listening to hammer time waking conflict Y. C. C. A. [noise]\nGood morning Prescott a it's Mike enters with amber time we are filling in for Andy Griffiths our executive director who is down in Phoenix doing some more for why she she ate and at the table this morning I've got two gentlemen with me check ... from the Carol company\nAnd mark the Terry from ... need a landscaping and we're talking about the way the industry is of all being the good the bad the ugly et cetera and check and I were just talking about some of the things that differences between the early to thousands and now\nAnd mark you got in do you do in the middle of the the downturn in two thousand nine how has it been for you as far as your grocery company what have you seen good and bad since you started business\nSure and and I hate to say it but at one point it was a little easier back then because I was able to handle the workload that I had of course had the people because people were more readily available during that downturn\nAnd of course it was easier to purchase equipment and things are on sale let's put it that way there were so many unfortunate people going out of business are changing businesses that\nAgain I thought there was a little opportunity for a small guy to get in there and start something and then of course from their with the up turning the economy we've been able to grow in and things have been good but very challenging from many different standpoint\nThey started by yourself how many current employees do you have\nWe have Twenty one total employees in the company now\nAnd and author or we're talking about some of the trials and tribulations that we're facing on a daily basis wasn't you share with our viewers and experience you had last week as far as trying to gain additional people\nYeah so typically we're actually laying off during the wintertime sometimes it all depends on the workload but our workload is stronger right now than it was middle of summer so we are trying to add about three or four more positions to the company\nAnd it has been very challenging you know we went and all different directions and I actually had in one day five interview set up that uh you know guys called an offer ads\nSet 'em up and not one of them showed up for a while and then there was another one the following day and so it's just been very difficult to get guys interested in you know the career opportunities that we have all across the board and the construction industry\nAnd that's something else we're talking about a fair is it the construction industry [noise] pardon me in the construction industry really is a profession\nAnd there are a lot of long term professional opportunities for people out there\nWho want to get into the business but uh the business up until the downturn uh I think had an image of well this is just part time work for people and it's really not a a long term opportunity and that's changed that's changed a lot so ... what do you see Chuck\nWell in in in ... let me jump in on this one because they think everybody is so focused on sending their kids to college but there's not enough jobs that these kids are you know going into debt for these college degrees to get\nIn order for people all across the industry and we do want to let you guys know out there there is truth her career opportunities whether it's working for somebody long term you do have to start somewhat from the bottom and learn the ropes but I mean you can be management you could be sales\nYou can own your own company which is part of the American dream and I at this we we've got to find a way the industry to get that out there and let these people know what's going to be hard to start is going to be a little physical work but you get past that it it can really be fun and rewarding\nYeah and I and I think the the mindset needs to be realistic that you don't just waltz into a company and start out in upper management writes you do have to as you said learn the ropes and start from the bottom but there's not a whole lot of\nOther blue collar or white collar opportunities when you get out of college within three years you you can be making fifty grand a year right without a hitch\nOr myself I graduated high school barely and um moved into the career field working for a relative that had a construction business\nAnd I'm I'm been in since Nineteen Seventy three and now I I own my own company um we've we've been\nIn business for a long time and for somebody with a a a basic high school education to become a business owner this country is about the only place that there is available for that to happen\nAnd it was somebody like myself can make that a career then um other folks can do the same thing and and one of the things that I feel that it's changed\nI'm In my\nChanged I'm\nIn my opinion is that the building business is a business and it's a profession I'm construction folks when I was starting out in the construction business basically most folks thought that if he went into the construction then you weren't able to do anything else\nAnd in my case maybe yes maybe you know but I've thrived in that business and and um our business is a big big outfits for this area as far as the amount of work that we've tied down\nIn ... I don't think people sometimes realize for example in the construction part of it in the framing part\nThere's a lot of math which involved in construction and I was just talking with my granddaughter this past weekend and we're talking about the importance of education and and and the importance of of applying yourself in grade school through high school I Can't stress enough because once you get out\nI mean every day we are using math in our respective businesses\nAs an example um as far as English in literature and being able to compose a resume or a proposal all those things come home to roost show going through just the primary grades and paying attention is very very important\nMy grandson hunter was over at the house yesterday um we had an opportunity to go do some target practicing and indeed was talking to me about school and and and he says I have trouble with ratios and percentages and\nAnd fractions and I said well okay what do you need to know and I was the worst math student at Denver graduated school but I'm really good at arithmetic has good say was yeah it was and so I was able to show him\nHow to do a figure out a percentage of something in a way that\nIt wasn't maybe textbook perfect but it works every time and it's quick and it's easy and so there's lots of things that you can't ... grade school and high school in the last free education you're ever going to get because once you're out of there you pay for it and one way or the other is either pay for college\nUh your college education or in my case it came out of my wallet Everytime I screw something up I wound up paying for it so\nTake advantage of that education and then and then\nKeep in mind that not every person is here to be a college student and if you feel like that maybe that's not something for you there are lots of other places for you to go where you can do will and be respected that what you do it\nAnd you can get involved in the construction industry sharper injuring off in one direction maybe find that you you know the engineering aspect really appeals to me and boom you can there's nothing to say that you can stop go to college and bring that back into the field\nAnd now with all these colleges on line like you said you could almost do it while having a full time job and and you know business management alone that's another hard power we're finding in our industry is fine in\nManagement and so you know taken those certainly courses and learning about 'cause all business have the same applications when it comes with the office you know we still have billions we haven't voicing you know so there's\nThere's a lot of good to be had out\nIn Boise posted in voice that helps to get the money at this point I can point so we're going to take another quick break and we will be back with you surely [noise]\nGutters are not created because you spend your heart and money on gutters that may not withstanding Arizona's harsh elements Arizona seamless

catching on with our board when there's lots of members of our board that serve and many other functions roadsides is being honest\nOur board that serve and many other functions roadsides is being on the contractors association\nYeah and and that they're not all a government related or vendor related because we've got people that serve on boards for habitat for humanity a lot of socially I'm related entities here in town so\nSo kudos to our industry I guess I'm trying to to to earn a little bit because we we do participate\nWell like even you and I held a sponsor that Gulf\nFor the kids this year and if you look at all the little league in the um [noise] gosh the YMCA teams and all that and most of those are all those teams are supported by contractors and businessmen of the area and it's great to see that and see everybody participate\nIt although it's a double edged sword because I Love to support industries or an ... like that but it's a little demeaning when you go out on the golf course and and you find out that a twelve year old whipping\nYet but that's okay because I don't get out of the Gulf War is for me [noise]\nNo it's a very good and I do I you know we got a plot all of our you know fellow businessmen that help because I think the kid there everything I mean it's our future church do we need to keep them interested in interacting in team sports 'cause I THINK Team sports also can apply in any company\nYou have ... absolutely if you get all your developing those social skills right and that very much helps you know I wanted to change that focus just a little bit and talk a little bit about the permits\nAre that are going Shani is very good about bringing in statistics and sharing those without ... radio audience as far as what is increasing and basically in all areas whether it's a towns and cities the county\nThey're all incurring incurring an uptick in business um and so while that's a blessing that is a double edged sword as we just talked about because it's a matter of trying to find the manpower in order to accommodate all those needs right\nThe timelines for pulling building permits and is is getting longer and longer and there's lots of reasons for that\nPart of it is the codes are getting so complicated that there are so many things that happened to be dealt with now that did not used to be an issue\nI Know engineers are being required to be involved in projects now more than ever homes that maybe ten years ago could have been built without engineering stamps now you just about the need to have those\nUh building departments\nAre always like to see the engineer stamp on something because it helps give them a layer of protection\nA the training that's involved in teaching the building inspectors the new codes and and what to watch out for and again building technology is rapidly evolving almost on a daily basis\nYou know used to be that the main difference between ... and the designers and architects and I'll backtrack for a second\nUh in the state of Arizona you do not have to be an art licensed architect provided set up plants however you're not able to what we call stamping your plans of a you have to be a licensed architect in order to stamp your plans\nBut it used to be that architects as you said could pretty well designed the home stamp their plans in a way we go uh I don't know one architect now the release it I've dealt with in recent years who is in in ... the help of structural engineer\nWe have a commercial projects that were fixing the start in town here and there was a civil engineer a structural engineer an engineer for the steel building there was an electrical engineer\nAnd an architect involved in this project for three thousand square foot addition on a steel building wow that is basically manufacturing and storage\nThe development of that project was such a huge education for myself\nUh in in the layers and layers of inspection and in time critical uh\nEverybody took four weeks to do whatever they did and then when you add all those numbers up that's a lot of time because there's lots of people involved in that project but it was necessary in order for it to get through the building department\nAnd that's one of the other things that has occurred uh with all the influx of a new regulations et cetera is at the timeline for building is certainly increased\nUm and from a ... consumer standpoint well they want to get in their House yesterday they need to understand that it's not just because the contractors subcontractors are trying to get 'em in there a lot of his dictated by the time it's going be required for inspection the inspection\nProcess maybe we could touch base a little bit on that perfect will be looking forward to

little bit about the permitting process\nAnd how that's changed and the requirements for permits which has just changed and mark was reiterating and I'd like you to share it with our listeners\nThe types of things that he has to get involved in now whereas before ten Fifteen Twenty years ago landscaper no problem they'll come in they'll take care of all your landscaping in Shelby and there'll be out no fuss no must know permits no applications done deal all that's changed it's\nChanged a lot you know I started about twenty five years ago and of course back then I don't think we had to pull a permit for anything you know and just recently we've got our current project going in Prescott valley where we have a you know ... structure and some barbecues and water features and\nYou know they've got some electrical and some gas lines going in there so we've had to go to the town and fall the permits for that and get a caller inspections as we go through ... and even like some of the barbecue stuff you know that wasn't even permitting five years ago but now as things are changing you know we're getting a structural stuff involved\n... there's permits across the board almost a techno you're supposed to pull permit for every irrigation back flow that should do so there's a lot out there that that should be permitted that may not be\nAnd that's just on my end of it let alone that changes I'm sure you guys have seen in the actual houses and commercial building\nAnd and that's I think that is another thing that I wanted to just quickly address a difference between the license professional contract getting there are entities and those that are the unlicensed\nA do it yourself or going to save you some money we won't pulls a permit and that's just the same as if you hire to license contractor well that's just not true it's just not true\nAnd\nWe're the talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM change you in a ... valley and on Ninety nine point nine FM K. two sixty me Ella Prescott\nMountain Gardner is paid for by water garden center and it's only responsible for content\nWelcome to the mountain gardener on Cape Cod name with local garden experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but let's can tip certain things are ... you'll reap huge reward now welcome your can lane\nWelcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardener this is your host can lane was you're talking about the landscape of northern Arizona and it is beautiful oh my gosh this is that this is what follows all about this is why\nWe live in northern Arizona it's just been so beautiful you know you thought winter was here and then all of a sudden it's nice to get the call the Indian Summers or or you remember back last spring\nYou thought it was warm thought it was warm that it was warm and then it got cold\nAnd then it went back up and it was it was like this violent\nWarm and cold warm and cold and and the temperature would swing like forty degrees between daytime nighttime and\nAnd that's why the prostate the last frost date of spring at most of the elevation is going to be the first week in may you higher elevation folks in Flagstaff and paint up lakeside and at a Williams you're you're going to be\nProbably the end of may you folks on the lower elevations cotton wood camp Verde Sedona Kingman you're probably down towards the\nEnd of April but basically if you took mothers' day plus or minus a couple of weeks and they decide\nThat are less frost it seems like in March we could we which we get tricked into wanting to plant too early our summer blooming things\nAnd so they get zipped the fruit trees get tricked into blooming too early and they get in zip to the fruit just taken\nEspecially if you're if you're planting the wrong variety is for the mountains so if you're painting a desert variety let's go to your big box store a big big cops go price ... thing and and and they've got these fruit trees out in front and there are so tempting 'cause they're like fifty bucks oh that's a great deal\nOf that or the wrong variety many many times they'll grow but don't ever bloom and fruit\nThat so that that's why timing is ... is is important and then also the variety is important right now we're into the fall blooming things I thought it would cover some of the things that shouldn't be planted right now things are best planted in the fall right now\nIf you seen ... all you see as cilantro a ... at your grocery store to go there is the take home and then then to plant it\nIt will not grow outdoors from this point forward it'll you put it out there within a week that\nThey are made for him in doors or in tropical Lynn\nThey're made for him in doors or in tropical landscapes or or interior landscapes are made for has health plans kitchen seal thinks he I've even struggled growing pains all in my window sill\nBecause if it touches that cold lasts in January and February it it does not like that if you close a curtain down in front of it and it's between the pain and and that's and that curtain it will it gets too cold there it'll just keel over and die\nAnd so they're made to be where it's warm\nRight now you can plant Rosemary you can plant lavender you time oregano salt serious chives garlic ... there's a whole series of plants that love to be planted now your best parsley crop will be planted now through\nOh the end of November So your best a lettuce spinach cauliflower Brussels sprouts they're all planted now\nAnd you're harvesting does for Thanksgiving dinner for Christmas dinner and they'll keep blooming or producing or you can harvest rapes through winter I Would say if you're into kale healthy you know there's no more antioxidants than there was an kale or beets those are best planted now\nSo that you get to work out four seasons the big mistake many people make when planting\nIs they'll take that last cool season crop in may\nWe've got our last frost is only going to get nothing but warmer we quickly go from seventies beautiful everyone celebrating the spring season two Ninety it's just hot in the mountains\nAnd and those spring blooming things don't like that equally if you go plants right now the summer loving things things I Love the heat\nWill the heat's pretty much gone at this point yes it's nice days but there is a chill in the evening it and it comes down to nighttime temperatures for most of these plants and so this is when you do want to plant your cool season things let's talk flowers year you're paying these love the cold\nAs one of the biggest mistakes a lot of folk think their thumbs are are are black\n'cause they miss timed or misjudged window plant that crop of\nOf pansies and so it it quickly ... it just falls over dead in the heat it above eighty five degrees paying these they're not happy and there's no amount of water or she didn't give him work to keep them alive\nThey love to be painted now the only thing that would be better if every to plant in about three weeks we get a light snow right on top of her up thanks giving they would absolutely celebrate that some plants like the cold\nSnap dragons are that way dusty Miller are that way viola as an ornamental kale there was actually edible kale which is very sweet very delicious\nMy bounces watering thinking about like Lisa actually sprinkles or she makes us too but it's got a with freshly cut up kale that's so good in a suit oh it's so good [noise] um and then there's ornamental kale\nAnd it's just meant to be pretty and they're typically reds purple and white they're just gorgeous and of course the most famous of all of the fall perennials moms or chrysanthemums\nThey love to be grown they love to be planted now and they'll keep coming back every year bigger and bigger and bigger to my mom's I planted as of ... a gallon I forget\nAnd now they're they've gotta be gotta be two feet across their glorious they've set to blossom twice they bloomed late summer and now they're blooming again so that just really what you want to see out of those principles but it's about the timing sometimes it's not you\nThat has the garden issue sometimes just the nursery you're you're\nThe advice you're getting and the timing you're getting the wrong variety or you're painting the right variety at the wrong time\nAnd it and it doesn't succeed or fail ... struggles and you're wondering oh what did I Do wrong it wasn't you it was\nIt was you were sold the wrong bill of goods basically so that's why we're so big here at least our garden Centre of of garden information so this is our fifty seven year of being open\nA fifty seven seasons fifty seven years\nWe started in Nineteen sixty two is to do the math right pretty sure um that are ... and and our formula has always been be friendly be neighborly and neighbors we're just we're leaning across the fence we're just sharing the advice that's really worked in our backyard and if you do these things are also worked for you and your back yard\nAnd and if you teach someone how to garden\nThey'll get the bill catch that bug and then want to do it more and if they're really good at it they'll start to tell it to their

named five you'll reap huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner really\nStarting to hit the peak of the fall colors season right throughout the whole whole region\nUh we're we're hitting it right on to it it really looks good right now especially in that six to five thousand foot level\nYou folks in the higher elevation to bend the yogurt the groom creeks and the highland pines you you've been in there for for probably a couple of weeks already\nWe're just now hitting the stride it's a little bit lower elevations and you folks at that you know thirty five hundred of five thousand foot level you'll be a couple of weeks after us to just has this pulsating wave your elevation and also\nNoticed your neighborhood ... fifty seven hundred feet\nA there is a very ... so there's probably go from six thousand a probably a five hundred foot elevation change routine the highest hill a house in the lowest what you'll find is those folks that are on the south facing hills they're warmer\nAnd so the plants are a little slower to turn color\nThose plants those houses are on the north the north side there are a little bit cooler more shaded and so those trees those shrubs they'll start to pop the sort of turn color faster sooner\nThat's also an elevations change if you're near a washer dryer I watch all that cold air in the evening settles in runs down that dry wash so those plants planned to closer to that\nLowes spot in the landscape there there'll be chilled they'll turn a colored sooner so you'll see the same plant in the same neighborhood\nTurning it different weeks maybe you've had a low seven to ten days difference\nBetween when the first one goes the last one\nAnd so my maple maple ... have been beautiful in our neighborhood they'd been a full ride them kind of jealous going to win his mind maple Glen charm color and it just just turn this week is starting to go\nAnd so it's not quite there another week and it will be full glorious read just beautiful so bits of Prescott blaze maple it's just stunning a hammer maple\nHas turned ... this week or the other name as flame maple it's kind of like a it's sort of reminds me of a Japanese maples got a small maple leaf\nSmall footprint small format typically comes in a multi stem format so a Japanese maple typically cabinet single trunk or the miniature tree form up to about ten twelve feet this wouldn't typically as they shaped multi stem to\nRed maple the region that flame maple it's hardy or better or a better choice for the mountains of Arizona is at our elevation the sun is pretty intense\nAnd so it's too intense for most Japanese maples it's hard for my southern folks to really understand Japanese maple grows and full sun to\nIn a in Missouri it does not do that here\nIt needs more protection needs more shade\nWill a flame of maple which kind of has a similar look he loves it just hit the hotter the better I mean planning out full sun surrounded with asphalt is happy happy happy and so it's and it's just turned a the most intense read\nOf most of the maples minutes like fire engine red head fairy dust to watch it glow I mean it is that kind of intense\nAnother one that's all right behind that this kind of a shrub a taller shrub gets up about had higher so six maybe seven feet ... a little bit shorter than a flame maple but burning Bush burning Bush or to you on a bus\nOr as a botanical name but burning Bush it's how we all reference it because it looks like\nThe thing is on fire it's fire red is glowing red\nRight now the stock we've got here in the nursery it's got kind of a purple Hughes goes from from dark rich green purple hue and then right before right after that it goes right read I mean like\nThe the the cord like a red straw it's that color ... bright bright red or it's that color and it is a very hearty plant for the mountains it's a great time to plant I Would say this is your\nIdeal time to plant because you can see the color you see all hardy it's going to be it's going to keep rooting out through the fall and then after the after the foliage drops because these are all deciduous plants deciduous means it sheds or leaves and has bright Paul color\nOr ever rains are going to be or con of hers are evergreens so it's kind of some some horticultural definition there get those out of the way uh but you want of us has this most interesting bark\nIt it's not like appealing bark it's got these ribs up and down the steps that are striking\nA they're beautiful to just cut off and bring it as a bundle I use them as a decoration on the table for Thanksgiving or Christmas her to bow on around them it's just they're very very unusual that those are one of the plants when I had to get my\nCertified nursery professional certification or this is pretty intense you got to know all your ... names be able to identify a plant by its with or without leaves one true what it is that through a deciduous I mean no foliage on this plant burning Bush in ...\nI mean no foliage on this plant burning Bush in this identification and yet ten plants id you go down you've got to get the Latin name and the botanical name of that and the and the common name\nScott okay wow was pretty tricky I got I got I'm writing my past I Am a certified professional but they threw into those in al never forget going I I remember that park but it's very distinct ... once you take a closer look you go you'll never forget\nThe burning Bush is one of those plants that may every yard should have one for their fall color\nAnd now's the time of you plant those typically there'll be in a two to five gallon size plant\nI should probably cover that to what sizes are best planted end when right now if you're painting in the autumn season now to the end of the year through throughout the new year it's better to plant a little bit larger root ball\nThat way if we do happen to get bitter cold all of a sudden in the ground ... bigger is better\nMore insulated more roots uh you'll get a larger ... mass for next summer as well are you you plant the smaller size one gallons four inch the tiny sizes there it's pure planting those

I gave the lack\nOf financial education for young people coming up so parents listen listen with two leaders on here one for you and one for your kids so that you can guide them through some of these strategic decisions and jets\nMaybe eliminate some pain along the way so\nIn today's world of banking and investing beneficiary designation isn't necessarily a document correct but it's part of a set of application processes when you open the new account mhm um then they're going to ask you\nAnd if they don't you ask them this is who I wanted my beneficiary mhm but even to be really wise and correct you say and this is who I Would want as a tangent beneficiary and capes\nBoth me and that person passes away mhm so quickly um it we're just looking at the big picture\nIn most cases that's part of the are larger on line for work for them they might give you so much but nowadays is on\nLine that you know I remember the ... I was twenty four when I joined ... and in all of my new hire paperwork with my four oh one K.\nAnd because that was pretty much mandatory they didn't give you a lot of options and I didn't know the answer is like okay I'm signing up this is how much is going into and the beneficiary designation was a part of\nMy retirement savings paperwork so I think that's a really good point that it isn't like you're ever going to type up something that says beneficiaries and lift them all rather you're going to identify what you have and how many of those can have their own separate beneficiary\nHow many of those might need to be handled in a different\nIt's how many of those might need to be handled in a different way\nBut the stuff I have now I Want this to go to my little brother I Want this to go to my mom and dad at one by bedspread to have this\nBaseball card collection him I had ever OK is stuff mhm and it will is simply a legal document that helps pass those things to the people you want them to go to build that an attorney or judges don't have to decide for you right it's really simple\nAnd then if you're going to be acquiring some thing take it one step further protected and make sure that you are the one not only acquiring but ultimately making the decision of where it does when you don't need it anymore\nCorrect you know what we need to break for commercial for a break

financial investments by visiting American financial security dot net are calling us at nine to wait seven seven one eight three six eight\nAnd we're back you know we ended up that first section ... talking about our twenty some things and just introducing the concept that as we begin to really spread our wings into adulthood the con more and more responsible for what we acquire\nAnd how much we acquire and what we want to do with what we've acquired now let's move into you know thirty and forty minutes where you're really getting into a career\nYou're really beginning to earn more and\nYou know maybe you're away from college debt by now like you're in more of the true acquisition mode you may also be thinking about expanding as family and we have some connection drums that exists culturally today\nWhere people live together without marriage\nThat can make some of these financial things a little more important to pay attention to\nOriented documents what those might include I'll put mine in there with the tax returns\nAnd since I seem to be the gather as many of the information necessary for them it but I'm the financial side you know people could keep a lot of different things but what do you recommend drawn so\nI'm really good point you know the older we get the more financial assets hopefully that we are accumulating\nAnd we'd say that hopefully because to retire the way that you want with your hopes and dreams and people need to consider okay I'm In a live after it if they retire at age sixty five um the average mortality is eighty five\nEven up to Ninety five so at least twenty twenty five thirty years living in retirement [laughter] well\nOver time\nThose circulated mistakes that you have er buckets of money financial assets um and tax returns you're getting accumulate statements and in today's digital narrow al cabinet what you have\nBut what we all have the choice than the option to do is to say to these financial institutions\nI Want to I Want to paper I Want my paper I Want paper statements I wanted to get a paper or want to feel that paper I Want to look at paper some people say no I Want all of those statements digitally right because I I don't want the paper\nAnd then there's some that are kind of right in between yeah I'm trying to cross over between the two so\nIt's important whether that you have the paper\nIn your hand that then you put in a file and over time that file gets really really big and it goes from one file cabinet of one drawer to to drawers three drawers to file cabinets for file cabinets blah blah you have a\nLot of people are really like in this digital because I can just go in and I can I can find it from my financial institution as well that gets a little bit more complicated because what if you find changed financial institution\nSo it it it's becoming a little bit more you have to be really savvy as far as okay I download those by saving them my store them either on my computer mhm\nOr a store them and make a hard copy on one of these little flash drives lashed drives her jumped drives mhm but what is becoming even more calm and is for people to store it in a cloud based\nA digital system that are very plentiful\nThese days right and maybe before we can go on\nWrite and maybe before we could go on or before we go on\nWe can just say that as a financial firm we have an amazing way to store in the cloud all of your financial documents if you want so that no matter where you are in the world you have access to those records exactly including\nFrom our previous segment all of those very important documents that you might need let's say you're traveling in Europe or your back visiting the kids in Pennsylvania and all of a sudden I'm you know a little minor emergency or a big emergency comes up\nOr the kids say well hey mom and dad were thinking that we want you to move back you're in love with us or\nLet's look can review your financial documents you could just plug into or generational volt and see everything there if that's where you want to put them mhm okay and I have access to them anywhere so\nThere's there's some really amazing ways that you can store documentation like the if you're so inclined mhm\nI I remember when or how old we are remember when we first started automating everything obviously I started earlier with EDS and we were automating everything and\nAnd if you had it you automated it that you didn't automate anything you can turn right around in print and it leads triplicate immediately because we just\nWeren't comfortable with not having the paper and it's okay if you're still like that you it's okay to keep the most recent statement it's okay to keep certain things and paper documents is that how your comfortable looking at them\nThat you may also want to consider having a duplicate backup\nCopy whether it's our generation of all whether it's an online account somewhere\nSo that as you say run one you always have access to it no matter where you are and to should you ever have to leave your home\nWhere are those documents if you have a fire or you have a mudslide oh gosh on my document or in my house still unacceptable\nSo we recommend people move a little bit towards some of the electronic storage as they get comfortable and confident with it and that's why we teach people how to use the gym involved that we have and so forth can help you scan your own document the end\nBecause of what a great way to give yourself some space in your file cabinet again if you could upload the last five years of your tax returns if you kept their year will your trust ... ... if that was there\nNot even getting to personal sin family pictures that may not be able to be replicated ever again\nLots of things that um you know new applications for that financial you know you could be a pack rat and save everything\nWe have we we know a lot of people like that you could be the minimalist to keep you know when you get a new statement and there goes the shredded old one topic a little bit more run about those statements particularly as it gets to the financial transactions\nSo one of the one of the critical things that we want to take a look at is like you said Barbara I'm investments in the last few minutes minute or so who are saying is that we have\nIs when it comes to investments on a taxable brokerage account one of the things that we want to keep track of from a talk from it from attacks standpoint is how much how much did you pay for those stocks mhm pots basis what we call ... basis how much did you pay for him\nBecause at some point when you choose to redeem those or sell those than the IRS is possibly going to want their portion of that mhm how am I going to tax the individual based on the game up that stock\nWell up until two thousand eleven a lot of those records were not required to be kept by the ah custodian of those of those stocks\nCorrected and for many people who move their financial accounts from one to another basis did not get transferred\nStolen some records you absolutely want to to keep up\nA record of that costs basis and one last thing and we did these last couple of seconds is tax records so you know if you've had it from like ours doing your taxes you're every year after year after year we have those records okay but if you've been
