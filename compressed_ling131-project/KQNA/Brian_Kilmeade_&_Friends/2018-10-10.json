wrap it up and going to break the back of the moment\nPresident Donald Trump is a very good at kind of the reality so elements of the presidency which is to say he's good at kind of you know shooting next week so I wouldn't be surprised if there's a name we haven't heard\nTune in next week so I wouldn't be surprised if there's a name we haven't heard um all of those people sort of makes sense I think Lieberman would it be excellent a kind of in that Nikki Haley tradition um and you know somebody with that experience I think right now would be very good although I I ... you know settling in Germany right now we're getting the ambassador\nI'm Dina Powell is a little bit different um she has a lot of experience she comes from a different kind of part of the Bush Bush person right\nYeah well she's the prescriptions comes from the kind of she was very close with Gary Cohn\nI'm and she has different kinds of strengths in different parts to it she's I think less of that\nFrom that kind of American exceptionalism ... tradition but that's not I'm not against or I don't want to you know there are people can have honest disagreements you know in general and foreign policy and on the right on foreign policy but it's a different a little bit of a different park\nShe'd be I think a little bit more a lower profile but you know I mean I think the hailing really did\nImport not only did herself frequencies America very good at the un and uh we're all kind of waiting to see what she does next and I met and she will at some point reenter public life\nI mean I imagine you're not going to wait six years in order to come back appeared memory Giuliani weight and he never could get momentum back when Bloomberg took over speaking of Bloomberg key is actually going to be a registered Democrat yes to understand is there any doubt in your mind is they're trying to run\n[laughter] well I don't really have any insight into it and you know I should say you know you pay my bills are paid my salary so at this point I I mean I don't know I I I Know that use if they're going to the interest obviously in the larger political stuff\nRight let's move on TALK about ah you say Americans opportunity in Iraq what is our opportunity now in Iraq I Know that they like the world with us as opposed to with Iran because our when we became clear them we weren't going to destroy\nTheir country and take their oil we actually were giving him a shot at freedom things or do I bet that we might have a window right now you believe right\nWell I Am going to say two things about this because I'm Glad you brought it up it doesn't get enough attention the conventional wisdom on Iraq is that it's the greatest mistake in Vietnam and worse and that is sort of you know a constant refrain\nBut let's look at that Fifteen Years later there have been for success in national elections there at the constitution there's we'll politics and free media in Iraq\nThere are a lot of problems in Iraq there was the rise of ice and they're still the real threat of violence ... similar kind of a weapon on but at the same time they are further along now\nAnd they are now to regular elections African constitution and they are demanding reform and here's another interesting thing about the moment\nThat we're in right now the person that like the slate of candidates don't want the most votes in the election in may that finally resulted in this government that was formed last week was led by somebody who is the crowd was fiercest critics was in\nThe Sheena Arab majority community in Iraq moved to the outsider of the Iranian influence in Iraq so that's data point number one data point number two is that over the summer and intensified September you saw real protest serious protests beyond just you know\nMarches and and and sit in there you know the Iranian consulate in Basra which is a traditionally very close to her on a since the fall of Saddam was burned by\nProtesters people are furious at the influence of Iran and that country ten years ago boss for what\nYou know seen as almost a sort of\nColony of Iran ten years later in twenty Eighteen Basra is maybe the ... center point of the new Iraqi resistance against Iran\nThat is something that I think bodes very well and you should not just assume that Iraq is going to always be uh the vessel of Iran which is pretty much just some shouldn't under Obama and I think\nYou know even at the end of Bush's uh you're just going to have to live with the Iranians there that that doesn't mean that the u._s. than a hundred thousand troops into Iraq and re fight the Iraq War that's not what I'm saying at all but it is an opportunity for the kind of diplomatic\nEconomic engagement I Know that sometimes foreign aid is seen as a dirty work but it shouldn't be in the case of Iraq where if you can use that investment\nUm to support the politicians that need to show their own people that their independence from Iran America can really play an important role there and that is the opportunity that we have and it's especially as the Iranian economy itself is about the crippling sanctions\nAnd here's a chance to really you know potentially make it at a difference here and and to prevent what we saw was the complete with that Iran takeover I mean how many times have you heard that in the last one of your rights well not necessarily selling a lot of Iraq is really resent Iran as right now I ...\nYeah I think it's a it's quite interesting we need so many like Ryan Crocker who thoroughly understands a rocket and understand to the power players or and have to be on ... where he right now like random liberal avenue ... river yeah we don't have enough back there right\nNow we do have an a bath or I'm I'm I I'm Sorry I'm not going to get the name of my head but I but you know Crocker\n... I think was a terrific ambassador in and he understood he he by the way he negotiated transfer the writings you have to negotiate with a lot of\nAn argument for that\nCompletely shutting someone diplomatically but it's understanding that it is that what we saw was\nInevitable if the Iranians were there forever and we would have to leave in the sense that they're going to basically be controlling the political process they didn't control the political process at the time and the permission to government their candidates did not do as well as they would have like in the election and now that we have the beginning of this new government in Iraq\nLets you know work with them and show that we can be just as good a partner to what they want 'em and not that it's just a back burner issue and network trying to leave in ... you know it's yesterday's news\n[noise] ah he lasted the Washington Post or the Washington Post writer it is to the turkey believes he was murdered they believe they they said they can wind up the footage to show what happened in Saudi Arabia can you tell us the latest\n[noise] All right so it's a couple of words of caution here um\nI mean when it was just Turkish officials I was more skeptical they have put out more evidence the Saudis story looks less and less plausible and we should\nBrace ourselves for the worst this has very significant implications because the Saudi Arabia the United states of an ally since\nNineteen thirties and the strategic rationale for that alliance is still going to be there even if it turns out that they get this horrendous unheard of a crime but\nWe also have an interest any rules based international system and that means that we cannot allow countries to\nKill the Washington Post journalists were even abducted Washington Post journalist the way that the Saudis have just done\nThey have if this is true this is what the Iranians through this is what the Russians do this work the ropes of the world to the people who have an interest in undermining that liberal international order and in that respect\nSaudi Arabia does need to pay a very significant consequences deter them from doing that I Do not think that means that we we think the fundamental us Saudi alliance as bad as this particular thing is and it does not necessarily negate the reforms of their younger crown prince who was\nFinally doing a lot of things that we've run of the Saudis to do for decades which is allowing women to\nSaudis to do for decades which is why when women to drive allowing all have movie theaters\nAre allowing some private investment and their oil company and finally doing something about the radical hate filled Islamic fundamentalism that comes from a lot of their mosques and they're kind of clerical then I was so all of those reforms are a good thing\nBut it comes with a really ugly ugly side as well and this is not the perfect example of it\nWe've seen a number of crackdowns of of of just sitting down to rape you people who do not deserve that creamy\nIt's I mean we see with you know a I'll see see you can say you know we're using between some bad options but the Saudis need to understand that they really cross the line here to somebody who was an American resident wound American citizen for for the Washington Post ...
