very confused and I don't mean\nConfused about her testimony regarding God with all\nThe first thing that she was that you know she said was not a lab some gap thing\nNobody out for joining rather Kathleen bill a cup of tea I'm a fellow does fly so or a cup of coffee which comes many different ways I mean you just come in law and order or I'd like some gap things I Do try to push and what you want\nYeah she also said no you got to remember this point he's got the master degree range\nPh state what does that mean to understand ... ... that anyone advise you\nRegarding the choice to the person that there'd be a pilot or bought bought a graph with um she also didn't understand the term on your behalf\nRegarding anyone speaking for to Congress after she had taken that tough to that one doesn't understand the total scope with very evident\nYeah the one on on your first thing you said about the coffee I I don't hold that against a actually that makes her look sympathetic in some ways but the thing I remember you're right when she said what does that mean on your behalf that kind of surprised me a little bit\nUm what I mean not only not only did they ask for a blood drive to the boss Peter tried to explain that to work and she's still didn't get it\nYeah well you're ... you make a point which is that there are a lot of things that are surprising but again as the other side which is if you micromanage anything uh a lot of us won't look that good right\nI I think it is key the only thing that the the interviewer or that's what I Want to say because she didn't seem like a prosecutor from each you know the ones who were what was her name the ones who are the Republicans Mitchell yeah\nUh I Would have thought she was going to go somewhere with the whole thing you know very gently do everything and then in kind of shows she got her and all she got I guess the flights\nYou know that he or she said that she didn't want to come to Washington because she's afraid of flying or whatever it wasn't here she took all these flights so I thought she was going to pile on all these inconsistencies and I thought\nThey were going to have to get them to see like what I expected which probably is why she wasn't there and the second half right\nYou guys all have Greek calls are are mostly yeah let's go to a sure in Minnesota I'm sure your own was marked\nBy mark Hi how are you well good I'm Out of a couple of things I'm the last caller was talking about her um her inconsistencies and her behavior\nUm I look at like two different types she was confused when they asked her to stand up and razor Arnold with like she'd never heard of that before I what I Do and I mean you know she just\nAnd then she had told her I don't know if anyone else do that but those glasses looked like they were either all fucked up or she never clean them and it almost gave her this little cat confused kind of look about\nAre actually the one hand I I actually heard that you had including the glasses for thirty five years [laughter]\nGet on the other hand she got two masters and I don't hear it and she teaches in two different colleges\nWait wait wait wait wait wait wait I Do oh you telling me you respect the eighty degrees master's degree\nYou know I'm just saying I'm just saying there is a huge\nDid that\nUm this threat maybe that's not the right we are now but yeah I agree with you as a huge difference as the other thing that I I wanted to mention is and I've not heard anyone say that um when they asked her about her friend Leland and if she would cut from there\nUm she she talked about the present well she's got some health issues and I'm going to respect your health issues I'm thinking about\nThis as a former fourteen year old girl even before health on that next hey we'll end what I call her and said you know what happened you know she is I can remember eight miles from home\nWell I should get home one of my friends and you know I didn't see how like it and she had a friend that she was reading at least give her a call and say\nYou know what happened after I left or any of those kind of things that get very little holes in her testimony that I Wish someone had jumped on\nYeah were you disappointed in the a prosecutor also asking those questions I didn't you think like I did this is going to reach a climax and\nI did and I kept thinking yeah I mean you know when it came to the new drink and then she was God my heart sank because I thought boy oh boy this is the rest of the day go ugly you know you were done for and I was\nSo proud of Brett Kavanaugh when he came in guns blazing and and anybody that you know make fun of him for crying or for bringing up his daughter pay I guess what are ... what would you not do if you were accused of something\nSo horrific well yeah and but you can't prove a negative\nWell of course and you can't win because if you've been come they would have said well he was accused of all these turns you to do but not find something the other St Louis to belligerent to be a justice if she can't win with them and that's the point you did it will I think you could call shirts\nYou you can't win with them
