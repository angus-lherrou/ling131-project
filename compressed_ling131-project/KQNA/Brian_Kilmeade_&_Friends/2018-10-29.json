tied to Saudi Arabia all his ties with Russia does ties with Scott ... go ahead do it it's called being an international business that's what he did to become president\nBill he shouldn't break all those relationships you should enhanced them there's no they're they're he's allowed to have relations just by the way Bush was tight with Saudi Arabia to\nDoesn't have to send troops are put boots on the ground in order to deal with an hour to limit the the the destruction and the instability that results from it took the new paradigm for the last hundred years so Newt\nHad a different take not necessarily against us but he was ... then\nAnd take not necessarily against us but he was doing more to live in a last night on life liberty and live in because forty seven\nAnd so from\nBecause he was running as a Republican\nAnd because he he he has no hostility to conservatism is just in think about a much\nAnd he was an enormous hostility to political correctness of liberalism\nBecause it just doesn't fit how he thinks the world works\nUh and so I think\nWe ended up with somebody who I compare to frankly there Andrew Jackson has one of the most disruptive presidents we've ever had because because he's not afraid to take on the establishment every single morning\nThey I don't disagree with that and the dimension of Andrew Jackson resonates with you obviously a and it resonates so I think with a lot of Americans who recognize that Jackson was he was kind of our our first real populist president who understood the relationship between American power\nAnd where America needed to be as a society where as directions at any gets a lot of bad press because of trail of tears and so on and I've written about the fact that Jackson is not the person should take the blame for\nWhat happened with all that but the point is is that if you if you compare Theodore Roosevelt view of America's role in the world and Donald Trump's or they are\nI Would say if not identical certainly parallel in ways that I think Americans right now I Begin to realize we actually gained a great deal by this new approach to America's role in the world\nAnd the way you view that Teddy Roosevelt to in the beginning they saw this guy was to robots almost comical I and the way he handled himself he was vice president thrown on the last minute to unify ticket I guess you know New York the threat of a police chiefs I run riders prior guy so and he was self promoting in many ways so and they\nHelp it and you know ... and ... that that that the tweet Twitter is Trump's bully part ... and it's a way in which he's been able to change the political dialogue in this country in extraordinary ways that we haven't really seen the end of\nThe people who sat them dating except a Roosevelt in and he took on business by the way but they didn't accept them really in Washington they never accepted Donald Trump he took a case of the people Teddy Roosevelt took his case of the people and they seem oblivious to criticism\nTotally and he is also a dumb mistake that Roosevelt made was in Nineteen twelve you split the Republican ticket\nAnd let Woodrow Wilson into the White House by running a against his own hand picked successor William Howard Taft because he didn't like some of task more conservative policies\nAnd that hurt him both as a figure within the Republican Party but it also open the door to someone like Woodrow Wilson and a progressive agenda both internationally and nationally that we are still trying to sort it out and still trying to clear out today\nTo Roosevelt gets his you know will make you only get killed yep right to he becomes president he finishes McKinley term didn't win re election and then says he's done an insurgency is finished in ... become handed over to tap the ... of the country which was not\nAn in anything if anything it was in many ways a reversing some of Roosevelt overreach in the progressive I especially in domestic politics but Roosevelt also keep in mind too he was our first real colorblind president you know he invited Booker T washing to come to the White House\nHe was a firm believer also in the idea of what we call the melting pot\nRight not the end of hyphenated Americans he would look at the situation with illegal immigration and sort of saying well we need immigrants who become Americans we don't need America as a haven where people come in order to preserve and to maintain a political or cultural identity which is antithetical to what America represents where America\nNeeds to go through you know the presidents are shortcomings you know his successors he's anything but traditional and he's he gets up every day he's a unorthodox in say the late for us somebody's historian and like David a I'm a David Hanson Victor Davis Hanson and others\nAre open and you know the general Keane to say okay I Know how things the only one but I'm open to see if this is going to work\nSo I'm just stunned to see the anti Semitism or the antics American gunman walk into a synagogue kill a loving people in cold blood and people troop draw it back to Donald Trump listening to Jonathan Weissman he's in New York Times deputy editor listen to this guy cutting non\nNot over what President trolley line we're not calling him a raider we're not calling when we don't know what I Am saying in\nThe show a reluctant time and time again to Charlotte his supporters and hit the orange and yellow that\nI'm not calling you a writer I think you're right that's right they said we are in semi fully on our side and he got pushed back hard enough that they saw\nThis guy is hates Trump so dry yet he hated Trump ... Israel Trump this Trump evading he gets criticized because he's too tight with Israel\nIt's a it's a guilt by association but it's so typical of the media's response to drop you know what\nThey're trying they live on Trump Trump has made them possible to maintain ratings to keep\nThemselves in the public eye and the only way which they can deal with this is and they're declining rail it relevance and declining influence that Trump presidency represents is to get more and more extreme and become more and more unqualified and their attacks on him\nAnd in some ways you know I watch this with people that I Know who are never Trump hers and I've watched sort of there if I'm going to ... send uses expression\nWashed their character deform as a result of this as a as a anger ... feeds on itself towards Trump and this has happened in our mainstream media look what's happened to the New York times and the Washington Post a decline of intellectual credibility which was never very high to begin with honors\nOr end with the with the mainstream media and it's infuriating Brian to watch and I know I Know that you you see this happening to those who call themselves your peers but it's also tragedy and I mean ... it has nothing to do with\nWith Donald Trump it has to do with their own growing impotence to shape the national dialogue and that drives me crazy\nAlso they were wrong comments Donald Trump will never do it I'm a nation Donald Trump will never win and he did all those things\nThat I have and I had people who were trapped ... hours in the summer who'd come to me at my office in sort of say do you think do you really think Donald Trump is going when it said yes I Do I think that the media is wrong I think the polls are off the mark here and I said\nAlso I said not only is he going to win I think could be a very good president he's actually exceeded my expectations from the point of view of what he's been able to accomplish and what he's been able to do here and he okay he's a bowling a China shop\nBut the American people said you know what it's time to break some ... and we need someone who's willing to do that and they sent down Trump been\nSo you are Michael Gerson speech writer for George Bush hates them rights everyday Abadi is you have George Will despise them doesn't want to be Republican anymore you a Bill Kristol a someone whose dad really was one

wrong\nYou know guys like Erick Erickson so you know I become I was in trouble but now I'm seeing what's going on and seeing how unfairly has been treated I'm back in yeah so I give people credit you can be wrong\nI'm back in I give people credit you could be wrong but why do you keep doubling and tripling down he's not going to get impeach he's gonna finish for years he's already got a plan in place it's going to be easier to get another four there was his first for\nTraffic it will be and and also to there's going to be a deep bench of young conservatives including people like uh like John

area and I was seeing that it's gonna be honest I'm not blaming anybody I put him there and made me a trade may be wrong but I put a couple of other people there that I'm not so happy with too but I'm very happy with people thought that is\nI'm very happy with people\nThought that is for the United states are you going to Trish Reagon about the fed and he says you know as our economy there's good and for cash to do well they raise rates and its robbing us or the momentum and nodding along is the co author of inside the America First plan to revive our economy even more\nSteven you think he was a lot of people are seeing all the prison should not comment on this how do you feel\nA lot I think he's right on the substance and I don't see anything inappropriate about the president who is basically the c._e._o. or our economy speaking out now that's not to say that that shouldn't be independent you just heard Donald Trump said he believes the fed should be independent but look\nThe economy is booming right now we were in the biggest boom in Thirty years we have seven million more workers than we have I mean jobs the way of workers and that's an amazing statistic\nSo the economy is booming and Trump is basically saying look there's no inflation why is the fed taking you know the old metaphor lives the lives of taking the punch bowl away from the ... just when it's getting going\nAnd I happen to agree with him on that look\nI don't want to see a ... of a return of inflation I Lived through the seventies I Lived through you know Fifteen sixteen percent inflation rate\nBut this idea that somehow this is a bogeyman inflation right now in food prices are not rising\nAnd there's too many people the fed who believed that growth in the economy and higher wages are inflationary now about laughter we're here Brian I Know what he would tell you you say if the economy produces more apples the price of Apple's falls it doesn't rise growth causes lower inflation not hire and play\nSo a white now you're looking at uh the market last week and a lot of people an upsurge that's for sure of your point up three points down ... points down what's going on\nA I think there's a lot of profit taking at the beginning I thought there was a lot of nervousness about what the fed was during work when interest rates rise than bombs are more attractive and sucks right I

what's going on with US Economy because you should also play\nI Know you probably have the send your catalog when Brock Obama set a few weeks before the election how is Donald Trump's going to get up to four percent growth how is he going to revive manufacturing does he have a magic wand well maybe this president does have a magic wand 'cause we have revived manufacturing we have revised the\nMining industry and we have four percent growth and now they're trying to explain why this is happening now here\nHere's the reason why it's not true that the Obama deserves the credit by the way when I get my speech is when I say you know it's just the Obama effect it is the bottom effect is the effect of Iraq Obama's no longer president that's why the economy is booming last year the Iraq Obama was president you can listen to surprise the economy grew at one point six percent that's pathetic\nThis is America we don't grow at one point six percent it's not growing at four that's the difference between being are cowardly sixty miles an hour and forty miles an hour pick up truck comics even more north of ... you got to read it\nAs [noise] as far as that [noise]\nAnd we all say this and also to Saturday but\nThe media's constant unfair coverage [noise] the possibility [noise]\nNegative attacks you know the [noise] only served to drive people apart\nAnd to undermine healthy debate\nSo he took the argument at him and I thought it was very fair go you got the media has got to see your role here\nIf you watch CNN MSNBC if something happens good with the economy they don't talk about right\nIf something's happened I just been decimated it doesn't doesn't wear reached the radar if something happens with the Mueller probe it leads are they lying no but they're putting you in order in answer to it on things that they think is going to get them ratings that food drives him nuts\nThat's right and and the ... and the media I tell people all the time is it necessarily what the coverage what they don't cover what they are ... how many people recognize him realize the president just signed a clean up our oceans ... to get plastic out of the oceans with some of the biggest offenders are in Asia how many people realize that he signed\nSex trafficking legislation to do is to stop sex trafficking in its tracks that law enforcement\nHas been pressing for for years the veterans accountability act the veteran's choice that all of the things people are getting done Brian I'm knocking hundreds\nH things people are getting done Brian I'm knocking hundreds of thousands of doors over the course of the last year year and people want results they recognize the results that are happening in their everyday lives there looking past the rhetoric and that's just what we have to keep\nTalking about the opioid to ah just pets and a bipartisan level money into opioid abuse and treatment\nThat is right or not and not only more broadly but with our veterans a community as well many of them running around with Ninety pounds of gear on for decades are all over the world are living with chronic pain and they're getting addicted to opioids so not only are we going to a deal with it more broadly but we need to deal with it within the VA thing and that's what they're getting done\nAnd colonel on top of that the one thing is and I've always said that is\nThe health care is did you don't even hear about Republicans and Democrats when it comes to health care it's all personal kind of plan do you have a and when you go to a hospital you go to a doctor what kind of care do you get how much comes out of your pocket it wouldn't matter what class you are it hits you so I think Republicans kinda dropped the ball here\nBrian I'm a business owner and for the for the last six years I've had to look at my employee dealing with double digit premium increases year after year after year under Obamacare these are people making maybe fifty sixty thousand dollars if you've got an eight to ten thousand dollar to ... you have to come out of pocket\nTen grand before your plan even kick then that's not a plan that's a joke so so I Am proposing talked about we have to get out the cost of care that the flow with Obamacare as it went after universal coverage and that's what Andrew Gillum and so many others free free free will nothing's free\nOr if we're going after the costs tort reform portability of insurance selling across to shape the price is what the president drug prices getting serious about Medicaid fraud and Medicare fraud that blowing up\nThe system that not only helps businesses like mind that helped individuals that helps the fastest growing part of our defense budget that is not aircraft carriers and planes it's health care costs and it helps our national debt ... what are you getting after the costs of\nCare and when people say that the president has made moves to stop covering preexisting conditions would the truth\nSo what the Democrats are running on nationwide is is a portion and amendment when they went after trying to fix Obamacare that basically said if you have a pre existing condition you were put into a high risk pool\nThe government and helps those individuals because obviously there are costs are much higher but for every one else it'll actually drive premiums down and drive their deductibles down\nSection ... found the right here at high risk over here the government absolutely should help those I Am ... I Am absolutely for helping people with preexisting conditions we should there's two pieces of Obamacare that we're okay\nOne was that miners can stay on their parents' plan typically one eighty six and two was that we have to take care of folks from pre existing conditions and the Democrats are essentially trying to scare seniors by telling them otherwise they are and ah all Americans by telling them otherwise\nTo things on the twenty six year oh because I'm seeing now my son's twenty two got a job offer them insurance\nAnd I go that's rare and one of the reasons is when you're a company you have to hire twenty two year old if you have to give them insurance\nThat's who sometimes can be a deterrent yeah they do I want to do that to an unproven person wouldn't take that risk but would you do is if you take the pressure off the company and say you know that person could stay in their parents' insurance that might for young business be aware its court had Fox we could afford to absorb mistake maybe the small business you can\nWell that's that's absolutely right it helps businesses like mind trying to grow a lot of these kids are going to start ups that are just trying to get off the ground and the most expensive part of their overhead\nIs exploding cost of India and so again we have to get at the affordability of care and that doesn't mean having the government take it over which is only going to balloon their costs look\nFry and for anybody who is telling you government run health care is the solution look at the VA\nTwelve hundred hospitals and clinics three hundred and sixty thousand employees their budget has doubled from thirty billion to sixty billion and yet that her and still are not getting the care that they need\nCook report Larry's habit of both say your seat is likely Republican Nate Silver at five thirty eight I'm a flip to twenty five percent of the Democrats when you're about it's about a one or two point race who it's going to be who's got the indoor and a lot of people who've been in the Green Bay in that case so what are your issues that I think matters a lot to the people of Florida but you know best healthcare matters\nNot take it away it's a fixed income security that matters\nAnd also this just in you might not know this\nUh according to Lucas Tom Watson who's respected by the Pentagon one of our reporters\nRoughly five thousand us troops us troops will be deploying to our southern border\nAs early as Tuesday the reinforcements headed to the southern border will remain as support troops not combat troops\nCan you believe that we have to ... we actually for the first time maybe since Eighteen thirty six South Korea to the Mexican war we have to put troops on the border to stop five to seven thousand people from storming in\nThat lets them Ryan two things one border security is absolutely national security there are instances of Hezbollah working with Mexican drug gangs to infiltrate they're using tunnels they're using smugglers you know eight smuggler who can move an immigrant\nOr drugs can move WMD can move\nCan move terrorists can move all kinds of bad stuff but you know on the on the legal side we have to reform that as well the ice sponsored an Afghan soldier who put his life on the line to fight with us he waited over five years he now has a family here started his own business\nI went to I was able to swear him in as a U.S citizen he was in tears should not taking fire here that's right it shouldn't have taken five years but you want to find someone who's angry about getting skipped in line by people coming across it illegally I talked to a veteran\nOr just the other day who is barely above the poverty line who's trying to get all the help that he can that he's owed by all of it that he helped defend and he'd say are you kidding me these people are going to come\nAnd be attacks on our schools on our hospitals in our infrastructure we have a legal immigration system it needs to be fixed but people have to play by the rules we are a nation of immigrants absolutely but you know we have to fix it\nAh when we come back with President Obama said about what a Michael Wall is concerned about other lieutenant colonel is going to be here who's running the Sixers chickens Florida we got stations all across Florida so if you have a question go ahead and pick up the phone one

its own thing with you know you get in touch with people you have known for years or seeing for years of her from but\nI don't know if it's so clear what side of the spectrum there on and that makes a difference [noise]\nBut in the news you at where I've heard about the ... murders at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nIt's hard to imagine that you go pray and be with your God and your fellow worshippers and you were murdered purely because of your face and it's it's just incredible not unlike when you go to your church and you were murdered purely because of your skin color\nOr you are threatening or attempted murder is committed because of your political persuasion\nThey all have one thing in common they make no sense except when you understand there is evil in the world committed by evil and deranged people\nThat the people are not born in good innocence seems to be a battle with those who are I don't know religious from those of us who are secular\nAnd if people are left to their own devices can commit horrible crimes\nAs would genocide or slavery so from the very beginning you write we teach our children that you know not every toys their talking I always love it when you go to a party and um it's your kids or someone else's birthday part of the kid goes and he your kid wants every toy\nThat the birthday kid has because they haven't been taught right they grow up selfish everything is about them when they're babies everybody's a doting on them and falling all over them so that's a key difference certainly between\nI think not only the religious and secular but the left and the right the people are not basically good because you hear all the time with the left that\nOh you know you got to be understanding of the murder or you got to be understanding of their background and stuff oh yeah there there's a real issue about whether the people would be good if left to their own devices and what is Dennis always caught something about the Germans tribes I think

say that when it comes to religion God I'll leave that morning Dennis but I Do know politics and government and I do know that we keep jumping over our guard rails which sweat the left and the Democrats and the media do when you find someone guilty without corroborating witnesses\nOr you go back to high school to examine teenage behavior or you don't allow people you disagree with their free speech\nOr when our press leaves their objectivity behind and adopt the agenda of one of the parties they agree with\nSo I Want to follow up with what I began with when I filled in on the Larry Elder show on friday we started with comments about the would be bomber's arrest I don't want to use his name to give them any publicity\nBut how the media have used that to pile on President Trump held a along with the Democrats and the left all all the same thing these days\nTo claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse to encourage acts like it would be bomber none of them like to see what Michael Moore suggests this\nWould be bomber none of them like to see what Michael Moore suggests this last weekend is a quote\nThe threat of right wing violence against figures on the American left is not new it is not an aberration it is not a violation of norms it is the norm watch the river and Murdoch's Fox News channel and right wing radio there we are\nHave preyed upon those who've seen their American Dream go up in smoke and they have helped to create a generation of angry that's what you guys are angry and violin conspiracy theorists who believe any live is perpetuated on those airwaves\nThese angry right wing manned oh it's really focusing [laughter] have been openly hopefully encouraged to act on those lies I guess he met openly encourage people to act on those lies even as late as this very morning when Trump was tweeting in and out of the moms were real\nSo that's just one example that the president tweeted the bombs may not be real since no one was killed I gotta admit it but thought crossed my mind too that maybe you know the bomber didn't want to kill anybody who knows the bombs may have been threatened but it's not an outrageous as he wants to make it\nAnd why what's he do that while conspiracies on the right did he name some real ones of course not they never name them and how about left wing conspiracy dawned on me perpetuated by left wing channels what about that nine eleven never happened and that George Bush created it\nOr this is this is when you may be familiar with that President Trump colluded with the Russians you spent two years on that one and as far as I Know it's still cold\nAnd President Trump was guilty of inciting the pipe bomber right that's the reason one or yeah as we said I Believe it or not in the ... attack\nOn the Jewish temple and their unchallenged even on right wing Fox here he's picking on Fox not that I Want to defend them was former Obama official claim yeah that's what I looted too\nThat President Trump's rhetorical help lead to an environment in which the temple murder operate I think it was an assistant sectors said I wasn't anybody famous\nOf course the president created an anti Semite or encourage them to create a tax or violence even though his grandchildren are Orthodox Jews and the murderer made it clear he was anti Trump the media will never give up on their agenda to blame him for everything bad that occurs\nAnd that the president's attacks on the media would not only fostering such a climate\nBut we're unjustified\nSee at Fox News hosts like Shepard Smith well you know what side he's on\nAnd even Chris Wallace in some ways joining that course and what to some of them site is proof the chance of lock her up the phrase fake media Oregon worse for them the enemy of the people so let me address these issues by by the way to count me in the crowd that crowd first\nBecause it's a legitimate conversation to decide whether or not Hillary Clinton is above the law and should be charged and tried for the crimes she committed\nIn fact when I suggested on another national show where I was filling in for the week\nThat I'd be willing to give her a path so I felt this way I'll give her a pass on jail if she ... bill would agree to go away and leave us alone which obviously they would never do that [laughter] I was being facetious I Would be willing so to speak to let sleeping dogs live\nSomeone called challenged means that I I Can't believe you mark I agree with everything you're saying as usually you often get that\nBut you're suggesting that Hillary's above the law and she should get away with her crimes\nAnd I had to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer except what I kind of thought of afterwards\nIt might be good for the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial\nCan you imagine the outcry and the further divisive and that's if that's even possible not sure that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that the ... legitimate discussion to have about whether she should be tried for crimes especially since she got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption of the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the cries to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press nothing to do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people wanted him to go to jail no he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea that this one set of rules for the Clinton than another set for the rest of us so lock her up is not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage\nThey really get on their high horse for that one and they were beyond offended but it's also legitimate the press not infrequently comes out was stores that are not true the latest example did you hear this one NBC was hiding ... evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's just one it's a good one [noise]\nIt seems NBC knew that you did they even support her lawyers characterization of his claims that you saw Kavanaugh spike drinks or engage in gang rape you didn't hear that John\nI think I got something on Shawn he didn't hear that bit of news yeah this so called serious offense is not outraged if you examine it from President Trump's respective or many of his supporters\nThe media is huge power to influence the course of events and the public's perception of events so if they're no longer object to reporters and a part of sense of the left which they have become\nThey will influence the people in a way that profoundly affect public policy\nTo the detriment of the truth so for example and I'll talk about on the next our legal immigration debate with the media showing heart wrenching stories of children being ripped away from their mother\nNever mention the fact that none of this would happen if the mothers didn't bring them here in the first place you never hear that or the more salient fact perhaps that whenever someone who's guilty of a crime catch though is that children are also so called ripped away from them when their parents go to jail\nThe children as far as I Know never go to jail along with their mother or father\nHow come that hardly ever reporter by the mainstream media so it can be put in perspective by the viewer or listener so the media shape the debate even in their use of the term undocumented well she lives on Fox News even though he more picked on them\nAnd saw at all it's all they lacked the proper documents to come to this country or your house or take your bank accounts I just don't have the right documents\nSo of course many people never hear the other side of issues if the press barely reports them so in that sense they're an enemy of the people because they're denying all the facts to the people and not allowing them to make their own decisions let me know what you think I think this is a big part of the issue he's right\nThe dentist Springer show live from
