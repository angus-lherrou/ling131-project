that they were going to be able to take back the Senate even by one thing\nI got an email from a democratic strategist to I tried the other day thing is how they play what I said several weeks ago doesn't hold a lot of the high desert in North Dakota absolutely and it's not a fan for a while now but you have seen the cat and I just got an opposite direction in terms of solidifying the Republican base in terms of the Senate and these districts and the house there are too many retirements I think\nFrom Republican to overcome it I think the ... districts are carved out but I also think we haven't talked about one important issue in terms of democratic voters took the gender gap\nWhich is not going to favor Republicans at all\nThey have a strong advantage to Democrats with women ... to believe some of the polls\nI agree and that's why some of those house suburban districts uh where soccer moms or whatever you want to call them a factor in uh probably you know turned upside down for the president and his party that said uh it the map changes for the Senate and in fact\nSome Senate Republicans in the leadership are looking at racist that they weren't even looking at\nLooking at New Jersey as saying that they could possibly create a brush fire over the next twenty two days and that becomes a concern for Bob Menendez um they're looking at Montana that was not really\nThought of as as in reach that is definitely in reach now\nInteresting so uh I have a quiz for you if I was to put you in charge of the Democratic party New Hampshire all these candidates to to pick from who want to run for president and to attract a good crowd everyone pay the ticket price who would you invite Brett\n[laughter] well if I'm wrong in the Democratic guard at a crowd of all\nBecause I think there could be a cast of thousands by the time we get there I mean really ... realistically Fifteen\nRight I haven't seen a boat you're looking at the same thing the Republicans looked at in twenty Fifteen as they were lining up and remember that first debate that we did in Cleveland you know we separated into tears uh that's what the Democrats are going to have to do this next time\nBut that's why I felt like you that's why I was surprised when their choice was a very recognizable face and voice he is the voice of Donald Trump on Saturday Night live in the next day he
