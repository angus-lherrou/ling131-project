still are of you to do other tours of bad country tours and tours it extend out from Brad Pitt but I've got no tour companies in town and\nImmediately this fire started in my heart and I have this desire to one day started to her company in town took me about ten years to get to the point where I um felt like I was a local or one [laughter] ever to um\nIt took actually my mom got really sick

our culture how cool\nNot so much to\nMe you know we see you driving around downtown in a golf cart sells ride Prescott\nBut I'm old always very courteous I always put my little hands singles out and

December and\nFebruary which which we do plant year round I mean we have our planting crews are putting plants in the ...\nYear round I mean we have our planting crews are putting plants in the ground every month of the year landscapers come in there planting twelve months out of the year\nAs long as the ground is not frozen were planted but you need a plant that has been acclimated or used to our climate if it's used to that frees thought cycle you plan to ride your yard be perfectly fine and so you're seeing this buildup of inventory right now at your local garden center where whether it's Kingman\nTo pine top to pay you send to\nSedona camp Verde or Prescott we're all kind of building up our image tore and if you're going to front load a lot of it with your evergreen stuff\nBecause it looks so good even in winter\nAnd this is when people ... most people most Deborah Granger planted\nNow through march that that's when ... peak window and so we're building that we're having more him in truth you've got more choices as a consumer\nWhen you have your local garden center and ... shot forever grains let's say it's a big spruce are you on a big a maple whatever it is you're you're you've got more choices now and they're larger sized so we're trying to bring in\nUh for for us this is water scored center in Prescott, Arizona this was just a ... ah we're looking for big evergreens that are in containers that are easier to move around easy to bring into your house and decorate and then take out of your house and plants and the landscape for\nLiving Christmas trees man so that's a tradition many we sell more\nLiving trees than we do cut trees in the month of December because we've planned out we've we've got enough to get through and we showed them often quite honestly I'd rather have people\nPlanted treaty then cut one down and use it throw it away I think that could be that might be considered wasteful and its way better than a plastic thing you got from China\nSo it's just kind of we we've that's our niche in the marketplace and so we we grow and we purchase and we ship in the month of October to accommodate that why do they even get on that track I lose track you see I see where I Am\nAnyway you're seeing this fall mixture of plants that your garden center the crate Myrtle ... we're not going to order another one of those until next summer a rows of Sharon is not going to be ordered again until\nNext summer you better grab if you want to summer blooming thing they're starting to show some color now so they're good they're get that typically either orange or yellow kind of Aspen gold color\nIf you want those if you want a blooming Russian sage view on a cell via Greg yea autumn stage you better rabbit now because it won't be at your local garden center here in ... with ... another three four or five weeks\nSo then the evergreens will come into their will come into their place so to Tony ... and ... as and that kind of stuff\nSo we'd been busy I mean my back kind of hurt\nFrom unloading hold the trucks but it's exciting to see the new materials coming in so it's kind of fun so and that's unique to a little bit more temperate climate\nYou folks from the Midwest the east coast you're you're kind of go and he's talking job he's talking some foreign language to me it's a Latin I have no idea what he's even saying because we've never planted before in the winter\nWhile you're not you're in you're in a warmer climate because it's so nice here year round I mean in January\nA week after major blizzard it's all melted off and his feeling good and you're outside of that could take a hike within a entered into layers you know and a vast you're not ... ... ... you don't need to do that anymore [noise] uh for for if you're a garden center odor there's several of us we're all friends friends if there was a major blizzard\nIn Flagstaff gets buried alive we all have agreements we just call each other we're hoping the blizzard ... mid week\nSo that we got we can work the weekend take the mid week off and we rented the flags that before anyone else and go hit the slopes and go ... so [laughter] that's great [noise]\nOnly in Arizona can you do that and then then you'll head down and play around the golf in Scottsdale so it's just the Arizona is the most awesome state ever welcome all you knew folks ah to to uh to God's Country it is a nicer here\nMainly because we're just the weather is so nice I mean it's not\nSouthern Californian ice but we don't have the pollution they got either so it's just better here so this is the season when you're seeing a lot of that transition\nInto fall color you folks from Palm Springs in southern Cal and Tucson and Phoenix ... the desert you know\nA El Paso is wet west of of of Austin those areas you're just not used to four seasons you're used to Amano season suck tropical solve the same time all the time here we actually have four very distinct seasons\nAnd so the fall season is really for our fault color and this is when the the the flat landers is what we call them the desert dwellers come up with the mountains and they want to see all the Aspen it's oh it's so pretty well you can grow one in your own yard you don't have to go anywhere you can just have one right there and it turns color\nHere in the month of October just has that beautiful fall color has that trembling it's a\nA populist ... is the Latin name for ... or trembling leaf\nPopular or troubling leads to Aspen that's our native Aspen that grows here would that beautiful white bark\nA that's the one birch you folks in the mid west you're used to more birch trees an aspirin trees and there are a little bit heartier but they get that white bark they've got a little bit more pointed leaf to ... leave\nBut definitely white park a little bit more of a weeping pattern not truly weeping trees but ... it kind of grows out kind of wispy and then comes down the the lead this don't Trimble but the branches do\nAnd what I find is in heavy clay soil the birds are actually blew tougher and he got to maintain both of them but they'll grow at almost any elevation if you get them at let's say if you're going to grow those over in\nIn cottonwood camp Verde I'm not sure about kingly your next time I flew through there I'm going to look for aspens over there I think they would probably grow if you put them on irrigation\nI had asked ... and ... when we we lived out there that's four thousand foot forty two hundred feet somewhere in there so that's I think ... are down about five hundred feet lower than that so yeah your I bet you could grow aspens out there would it take to win sweeps across the desert of that's the question\nIn the trunks of trees and then grubs in the ground\nAnd so it's really easy to kill them we've got a grub killers called\nGrub killer I mean that's what's going on like a fertilizer water than whites them out an application will take you through your next spring so once and done kind of thing so yeah they're very important I Would do not just those few moms you just planted I Would do that entire bed\nAnd I might even test they test all just to look for other areas because it's such a problem here they they attack plans by the hundreds so yes serious grub killer killed scrubs\nAnd even go in your containers and remember no was it last year we were had this beautiful\nUm [noise] ... not ... and it was just started looking\nUgly and I'm like what is the problem with that thing and went to the kind of look at it and touched it and it fell out of the\nPot ... Ruth yeah so it can happen anywhere pots raised beds trees shrubs and it's something to\nKeep working on their ... beetle larva so the Beatles ... roam around they're laying eggs and things and so the exit hatched now and now they're actively grow and these are this year's grubs you're seeing\nAnd so they'll tripled in size before next spring though a so they'll they'll eat actively through mid December\nThen they'll go real deep as the ground gets cold to hibernate down there and then they'll come back up and eat your spring groups and then your plant blow over in the when you wonder what happens or your who grow\nThe fade starts looking terrible you pull up no roots left grass will get big brown spots in um those are all grub issues and need to be dealt with it serious grip kill or be right back with ... and the mountain\nGardeners that mountain Gardner your source for gardening fights for the higher elevations of Arizona with local garden ... and the mountain Gardner himself can lane listen each week for Ken tip strength and technique that are shore to make a difference in your yard this season\n\nAt least it with a plan for the weekend or I had the\nMost majestic evolve rats were friday grooves only five feet making it easier to care for\nHim feathering bloom now has long hair everything how tall are the flowing green foliage\nThirty nine dollars isn't perfect campus grass is ready for ... also was I\nThink around here at water gardens and demand for people who love I resent the grasses in Latin shot you know where to find that\nI'm Out of home now and I lost my new little apartment but there's something I mess watching my mom guardian in our back yard she gave those flowers and plants that are personal running patch that I Know\nWell jak visited my local garden center and they gave me some great ideas from now when I look out my patio and now I think it'd be awful plan for your knees and yet they flew with bright Arizona flowers like being with mom and her garden what\nHelp with planning it's all online at all and that's something that or do you buy the Arizona nursery association at plant something dot org you'll love it\nReady to rock and you look for your landscape and this is\nSam and our team if I get there it will help you design your rock only says we are proud to be an authorized taped on dealer offering top ...

lane mountain gardening can be challenging but with Ken hipster things aren't anti you'll reap huge rewards now welcome to the mountains Gardner some things\nThat I did personally in my own personal gardens at my house not here at the garden center at the house is right before that storm hit\nLast week uh I I fertilized everything in the landscape this is truly the the most important feeding of the entire year now you can do it any time of the month of October\nI Would just simply taking advantage of the rain that was coming so I get that food on the ground and then in the ground I mean it's actually the rain with but there's also met at wash it into the grounds to plant can start to pick that up it'll do two things if you do it earlier in October rather than waiting till things are truly dormant\nMaybe do it now you can actually change the ph of the soil if you're using the right food now I'll go into that in a bit ah how far a Deep Throat want to go with this\nUh what what I Do I put my own food it's it's got cotton seed meal and some sulfur and you're putting that on the ground now would that sold for ... it will actually lower the ph of the soil you're changing not just fertilizing the plants\nYou're changing the ph the structure of the chemistry of the soil around the plant that makes it more acidic\nWhat that does for use it brings the color out it there'll be intense or orange intense or purple more intense reds showing up by fertilizing earlier rather than later\nSome of your your your red maples they aren't read it all your red ash it's not it's not purple or read at all your your your your yellow and that's all because the ph ph creeps up to a certain level the the colors lost your fragrance what will disappear\nOn some things like roses assume you're ... your ... flower things rooted Vecchia your mom's won't have the same you're paying these one of the same fragrances that they're ... they're noted for it if you're a lie lax\nBloomed the last couple of years the only reason that is is because they're ... they're starving and so when a plant can't doesn't have enough food to access it\nIt doesn't have enough food to access it will negate the flowers to just go I Can't spend any energy and the flowers I just have to keep my full of July because I'm worried about starving to death and so that's that's indication you need to fertilize and for those bring blooming plants\nYou really need to fertilize now in the fall it's using that food to form that by ... through winter to show off next spring that's why it's so important so if you're that this is where we have very heavy clay soils very alkaline water\nAnd not much top soils you this is super important this is more important here in the mountains of Arizona than probably\nAny place else in the country and it has to do because of our clay soil the other half's has to do with our monsoon rains pick up what little bit of tops all we have\nAnd it flush it washes it or or has it float downstream and so you'll see these beautiful like against Kirkland creek or ... you'll see these beautiful big washes with sick topsoil because all the mountains there soils actually wash it down into these\nSilky or a basins so especially the rich tops you know soil\nIn the soil equals no food no food equals no flowers you need to fertilize more often\nSo you'll find in the mountains of Arizona you're going to have to fertilize\nI say at least three times a year evergreens for Easter if you'd say think holidays this is one where you probably do want to pull over\nIf you tuned in and you're driving down the road ... now's the time pulled over bought that pen and paper that get that cell phone app yo notes here we got him a fertilized three times a year most of my landscape evergreens for and here are the holidays that I use is markers Easter\nIs my is my spring feeding fourth of July independence day\nIs my summer feeding 'cause it's right before the the rains hit that point and then Halloween October sometime in October you need to fertilize of landscapes especially for the spring glimmers and might evergreens out fertilize at the new year\nAnd so that keeps them green and lush and dark so they don't fade and get this winter closest that happens and so I encourage you and the and the most important of all of those for feeding\nFall fall absolutely is is without doubt the number one this one you don't want to mess all there's different kinds of foods a scope cover that I got a minute and a half year let's see if I can go deep deep I can go [noise]\nI like organic foods I'm an organic guy were organic shots are our plants are organic our our vegetables or non GMO our\nTrees are all organic me everything is that's a big thing and the reason I Do that is that yes my customers like it but mainly thinking what a garden center owner after a lifetime of just spraying chemicals around and deal with chemicals what the odds of you getting through the end of life without cancer about zero\nNow I'm going to have melanoma and stuff but I don't want internal\nStructure because I was selling round up and metal by on and die as an on and all these other nasty things a lot of them off the market anymore I tried to organic and I find my customers appreciate that as well or at least their dogs do in their birds do so he organic we've got to organic fertilizer\nAnd so we spread that out it breaks down slower over the next three months the plants absorb more and more of this food it changes the ph or lowers because we make it for us the mountains it actually has a lot of soul print it lowers that ph with changing the chemistry so the plankton take up more of that fertilizer\nBut this time of year the point being fertilize I took advantage of the rain but if you didn't just get it on there you don't have to work it in just get it on and Mother Nature will send us more moisture that will do all that work\nA those are all great choices the bread prepare ornamental pairs Cleveland I'm rich ... there's a lot of different ornamental pairs they don't form pairs they formed there just flowers without the fruit tickets sprinkler hours but around\nHaven't even started showing color yet maybe another month they'll start showing some color and their stunning rich red meat deep fire engine like I Want the lights on fire engine red that's a color that tree\nYeah very pretty um if you're medium country they would say the re wood ash is absolutely gorgeous there's blame maple too for small trees lots of color treat come in and check them out\nAnd it's time to plant trees so go for it so the fall color starting to show up and come in and pick up the leaves off the ground there for either in color so here waters earns

listening to the mountain Gardner with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but let's can turn things are named five you'll read huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner All right\nJust see if I can share go deeper into this tree thing and it was on to 'em what kinds of trees can you grow your what what let's go from a small\nTo medium to large and I'll focused mainly on the leafy things not so much fruit trees are fruit trees just mentioned that real quick yes we grow exceptional fruits\nWe don't grow any citrus or avocados that's more of the southern Cal desert kind of thing but here we do grow exceptional apples\nHairs harvest has been tremendous Egypt oh my gosh cherries cherries gross so well the higher elevations of the mountains Arizona they really do well um I Would say apricot nectar Marines actually will grow in your backyard\nAnd there are so fruitful only takes one tree and you're done uh plums oh my gosh the best plums you've ever tasted coming out of your own backyard this this is your time to plant those and so those are your fruits that you can grow what you're looking for those kinds of trees are chilling hours\nYou want a minimum absolute bottom line minimum you want six hundred to six hundred and fifty chilling hours on that Tagalog she tell you\nA late bloomer highly blooming it's going to be what we want is a lot of chilling hours so that what that is what's fruit trees is needs um any so many nights a cold before it triggers it's bloom\nAnd so a desert variety might have\nTwo hundred chilling hours you need some cold but not very much so it's blooming by February January up and even at the higher elevations appearance is getting a chilling hours to blow that more for the desert so low altitude a kind of stuff here we want a minimum apples\nI'm looking for Apple that need at least nine hundred thousand eleven hundred chilling hours so they're not going to bloom until the end of April May before they start waking up so I get them out of\nThat risk of frost by then we're hitting our our last prostate usually know blew my you can get a a paper cuts the biggest mistake ever anyone ever makes planting in the mountains so planting apricot know do do a desert variety and so they're blooming in February oh my gosh first of march\nWill our last prostate here in Prescott his Mother's Day\nThat's the first week of it you get two months\nOf exposure to possible frost so what's the likely to get into an apricot a desert variety apricot virtually none the tree is not affected at all it's the fruit when does it blooms set fruit and if that flower or fruit gets it gets frozen it dies ... the fruit falls off\nThe tree doesn't die but the fruit will shrivel up and fall off\nSo you want we've got a Chilton heart cots tilting apricot they have an eight hundred chilling hours\nThey're getting out there getting real close to that last frost date\nSo you have much more consistent fruiting and that type of apricot that the point being I don't want to go into deeper than that do your homework\nKnow who you're buying it from what variety and how many chilling hours it needs and minimum or six six hundred and fifty hours even that slow I Would say seven eight hundred is what I Would do for my own self\nI wouldn't do any lower than that uh but you'll find all kinds of stuff in the mountains you just find all kinds of this desert influence coming at you and so a lot of folks plant the wrong variety of fruit tree especially if you're shopping at the big boxes they're bringing that the ... fifty every one of my stores and all of Arizona\nSo far no gala to Flagstaff ... up everything in between you've got the same variety of desert\nFruit tree that doesn't grow anyway get embarrassed\nBy what I see other folks selling if their garden Centers for here\nFruit trees so if you're talking about smaller or trees in general just ornamental trees not fruit trees ornamental\nOr you've got red buts were famous for red buds a western red bud grows wild eastern red ... thinks it grows wild here they just do really well crab apples or have the show ... all of the fruiting spring trees a you've got right now is a service Barry or\nOr what is that what's the botanical on that\nAnyway there's a wild cherry a choked cherry kind of thing that grows wild here it doesn't for mature it's got a white flour and spring but it's beautiful orange and read the colors and the fall of the year\nDoes it's a smaller tree you'll see a tree just really wild a white out in the wild and that's usually that that that type of jury\nA purple leaves plum of course is probably the most almost over done to all of the trees but a lot of folks come from green country and I've never seen a purple treat\nYour I Want all part of our ... our phone call a little bit is good but a lot of it it's a good one to enter mix from a design standpoint put ... spots a purple with your greens and things and and it looks good\nI'd say the same thing with your purple birch\nUh you're purple cherries there's several trees a purple foliage on there's even a purple red but of all things forest pansy read but\nVery interesting because cheaply but the foliage is purple\nSo that that's another small if you're a medium sized trees I Would really we're getting into some definition\nBut I always say dingo you you California folks you love gained goes do really well here very long lived one of the most ancient of all trees we see ... in the fall so record\nAre from millions of years ago you can you can have one of those in your backyard they're still growing today and stunning uh Aspen gold color they are just starting to show their fault color a very pretty leaf to it\nTo show their fall color a very pretty leaf to it I Would I Would put in that same ... I'm\nA category Amish from Arizona ash which is the native to mid ... which I Can't tell the difference between the two but desks or Arizona I suspect command interchangeably but the good and medium

and your claim in perfect harmony and now Iran and Barbara to help you find out how to be financially dude\nAnd good morning Arizona and welcome to another and addition as financially ten which round and Barbara Hey Ryan how are you this morning\nVery well you know there's a lot going on in the world of are investing taxes absolutely financial planning a looking at your future in terms of are you ready for retirement\nAre you getting ready for retirement so what we thought we would do today is you know we get a lot of calls\nAnd we also see a lot of people ... and we we like to educate people in terms of um if if we're getting calls if we're being asked a lot of frequent questions which we do sometimes we like to have a show that\nReally focuses on some of those key topics\nAnd so today we've we've singled out three different topics that seemed to be a popular right now and one is we see and we have a lot of single women mhm I'm either that they've been married and before and their spouses past\nOr does it where it or they're divorced or and so we're going to talk about women and finance and women um in retirement and what they may be some key point that we really need to look at\nWell and remember that in many women and never marry have successful careers except for life and simply do not ever sanctify and marriage so it's really important you know as longevity statistics has come out\nWomen we are going to outlive our men\nAnd statistics are jets with it now obviously we all know exceptions to that rule that you know one of the things we've seen already this taxis and Ryan is several women who have become recently widowed and the struggle they have depending upon how\nInvolved they were\nWhen their spouses were alive\nWith the finances with investment decisions and with tax planning and tax preparation\nTrue we we really live in a different world than in the past and it's one of those situations\nWhere we would like to educate more and more women to to really take a lot of ownership meaning understanding ownership sure as far as the family financial dynamics mhm what do we hang up when is all of what is the big financial plan for the family\nAnd what where my own life be like with the decisions that way or you my spouse are making now relative to our money is the likelihood is I'm going to be here when you are not\nAnd this is a ... that's a real ... we talked about this in our seminar I'm always very and invested in this topic and having been single for a long time\nMarried and for a long time I've been on both ends of the spectrum and I care intensely for\nThe women I work with and especially in terms as well what do they understand about their financial situation what participation are they having in the decisions that will ultimately impact them and what did they really know\nAbout handling of the finances planning for the future and again this husky process we go through every year called filing taxes\nWealth is as I meet with a lot of\nHusbands and wives are a lot of single ... single women either divorced and or widowed mhm um\nI constantly am saying that the last thing that we want to have happen is for there to be surprises right when when a spouse passes away um if you're a single woman\nUm we do a lot of training in a lot of um information\nA gathering and giving you that relative to how women\nAnd men for that matter can prepare themselves for retirement so\nA a staggering statistics can keep in mind this statistic is a couple of years old but only about fifty four percent of women age sixty five\nAnd older were single and two thousand at fourteen that's a big percentage checked more than half of it is\nWhat we want to do is just to make sure that are\nOn a day to day basis that those women have the skills and the knowledge to to make sure that they're making the most correct decisions for themselves\nBecause if you think about it you take that statistic at age sixty five and the statistics are there's another Twenty years men in them for women\nSo that's Twenty years that lady we need to be responsible and ready to be responsible and to handle our own finances in the broad as possible tend to the word so\nWhat we've seen recently is a couple of situations where I'm\nA husband and wife all of a sudden the the husband passed away\nAnd these are real life examples we're not going to use names um\nHad been married for over Thirty years\nBut all of a sudden we're finding many many different types of accounts that don't have the correct beneficiary a designation on them right and\nThat's a surprise\nFrom the standpoint that OK Now we're after\nHaving to paddle through\nGetting all of that transferred to the surviving spouses name\nAnd you know it's all of this was done under\nYou know other advisors that\nAgainst just didn't think it was important to to make sure the beneficiary designations entitle lean had been done very correctly or perhaps in the northern part of this was um I don't need an advisor there\nSome when someone been correctly overseen\nThe financial plant so\nWhere we're going with that is to to check than fishery designations makes sure even though we're a ... a community property state we want to make sure the husband and wives names are\nJointly on accounts that they should be like that they are the primary beneficiary on accounts just so that when there is a surprise in this case where all of a sudden the spouse was dead within a couple of days passed away\nThat's a surprise and there was and now we're left with the\nPretty difficult situation to clear all this up\nIf you have a financial planner but you don't have or if you don't have one but you'd think maybe I should get one get to know them mhm that person does team that those people they need to be people that you trust\nThat you you're possibly your kids trust mhm knowing\nThey're taking care of me they're working in my best interests exactly area responsibility yes and as a company as individuals we feel like we have always\nWe feel like our parents taught us to be produced years exactly and that we are in business and in personal life as well yeah\nYou know in this segment before we ran out of time again because I'm the one that barks a lot about women being prepared for retirement outside of really knowing and trusting a financial planner ... women\nWe often do not plan for our own long term care and that's something we're going to talk about a little bit later but we tend to think oh gosh if we have children\nI'll just go and live with when my children and as a plan that may or may not be the best one\nIf you are talking with your spouse now at ... pension about Social Security about any kind of retirement distributions make sure you're involved in that decision about is this a joint life payout at single life payout in other words\nRight maybe maybe a strategy is to\nTurn on that bucket of income later mhm but one of the other things that we're looking at is what happens when one spouse passes away mhm let's say one spouse has a Fifteen hundred dollars a month of Social Security benefits\nAnd the other spouse has one thousand\nBut all of a sudden one spouse passes the way\nThat means rather than twenty five hundred dollars of Social Security benefits come into the home every month ...\nGet struck down to Fifteen hundred exactly then we have to either look at other assets to make up the difference for that surviving spouse\nThey're in trouble financially exactly because of lack of planning and preparation has suddenly resulted in not only the lots of a partner but it pretty significant lots of income stream\nYou know the other thing is I can make one more thing in ... and ... and they weren't going to jump into a pension we really need to go to a very\nOh darn I'll be right back saying we'll plan on taking their Social Security benefits at one of three ages sixty two sixty six or seven days what did you know that there are over twenty thousand calculations that could be run to determine the best time for you to file\nCall American financial investments at nine to eight seven seven one eight three six eight or visit American financial security dot net request your complimentary Social Security ... report it will help you learn how to get the most\nOut of your benefit [noise]\nAnd now back to financially tuned with Ron Barber seasons and [noise]\nOkay Arizona Welcome back to the final segment and this will be a fast one you know run necessarily had to cut me off there to go to a break abide\nI'm kind of the dog with a bone relative to tax imagined that and the thing that I always like to remind people especially when we're talking about income planning and Social Security is that this is a key area\nThat supports my claim that not all money is created equal\nWhat I mean by that is if you start taking Social Security versus the pension\nPension is one hundred percent taxable in most cases unless you've got a teeny little off fat and interests David instead they're taxable\nSocial Security the more we can beef up our income stream to come from Social Security one the worst case is that the amount you receive will be eighty five percent taxable\nNot one hundred eighty five in Arizona where one of the states that does not taxpayer and Social Security at all so that is considered free money to Arizona\nWhy wouldn't we do everything we could when we can control it and it's the right decision to make our last taxable money be a larger part of our guaranteed income streams\nThe larger part of our guaranteed income streams and that's just part of the planning process well\nOne of the things that we take a look at it in our practice when we're I'm\nMeeting with clients is we're looking not only at their Social Security benefits that will sustain them the rest of their lives guaranteed income\nBut we're also looking at for those people that are either worked for governments or for companies that offer them a pension right and the pension I'm for any of you that have them is guaranteed income stream for the rape manger of your\nLife and hopefully if you did it\nYou know you're planning when you chose chose that pension payout is that you and that spouse we're taking a look at okay do we want this for a single life or do we want it for both of our lives ... and\nAnd that's a that's a really critical decision that we help people make when they're they're faced with that\nBut what we've also seen as a growing trend where these large companies have offered pensions and they'd been handed out of pension\nBut because of where bond yields ... or where they ban lower and trade rates and eight nine years and the the costs of maintaining those pension funds what we're seeing is a growing trend where some of these companies are offering a pension\nBuyout wherever it can you can you describe\nSure how how those by what we're seeing what those by\nYou that what we're saying is people getting a letter they haven't started taking their pension yet or in many cases some of them have by that company that sends a nice cheerful letter and says oh gosh\nAnd we'd like to provide our pension future retirees with a special offer a for you to take control of your own pension and here's the amount of money you would get if you took it as a lump sum\nAs opposed to here's the money we are committed and required to have to pay you so over the rest of your life\nTo keep in mind that\nThat most pensions for most people you work for that company for all these years and then all of a sudden you had credits built up ... in ... in a defined benefit plan\nAnd all of a sudden based on how many years that you work for that company and what your salary was through your average income than they would have said okay for all your years of service we're going to give you Fifteen hundred dollars a month\nPension right so all of a sudden you've been getting Fifteen hundred a month for five six eight years and then you get this letter that you're describing Barbara mhm and\nHow would you like to take a hundred and twenty five thousand\nAnd now ... or three hundred thousand yeah so it's very very critical because\nYou build a life around well this pension I get this pension every month and I'm used to getting that Fifteen hundred dollars

was a typical response to HIS Video for ... you know ... comes out with a video every week a five minute video [noise] pays a serious thinker it daily wire\nWhere he is very popular ... test\nSo a lot of comments say things like I Can't believe I watched this video it made me sick\nBut they don't tell in the vast majority of cases they don't explain why it made them sick\nIt's ... it's in your seat for people on the left that's enough\nBecause its feelings based so if it made them sick\nThat is definitional only sufficient to invalidate the video\nSo we have Andrew back\nSo we have Andrew back\nUh I think um\nI don't know what I think he went for a vodka tonic her something I'm not I'm not quite sure uh but we got your\nBack Andrew I'm not hearing Andrew so [laughter]\nWe'll we'll hear

million subscribers there and [laughter]\nSo uh here is a typical comment I Can't believe I watched this video it made me sick they don't tell why made them sick and I was saying well we were getting you back for most people on the left ... being made sick is sufficient one does not have to explain why one is how many sick\n[noise] yes that's ... it's absolutely like the ... you know this is the thing I mean we're watching this obviously unfold Cavanaugh\nA debate is this powerful powerful in move to energy this idea that if you start screaming if you start weeping if you know bad but something must be wrong and that's just not true just actually true\nAnd it's it's a very strange reaction to take too because it raises again this question\nI I disagree with you I'm not sick why why to my ideas make you sick but you don't make me think of just it just ... points to the fact that something must be wrong\nWell and and as I said it's it's so feelings based but I really would like to know what what me again I Want to interview these people I mean in my listeners knowing serious\nThey're all anonymous but if somebody said you and and I'm contact the bowl [laughter] the following email address I think we would contact them\nI I remember when I wrote a piece a moral my columns years ago saying it's titled when I went out when a wife or when a woman is not in the mood suggesting that if you love your husband\nYou might on occasion not let mood alone determine whether you have relations with him because it's so important to most husbands and it's such a loving thing to do so the Daily Kos a ... attack me for advocating marital rape\nAnd I don't know and the Huffington Post did let this this past week they did it on the same column from ten years ago Prager who was advocated marital rape\nThe videos yeah go on\nThis it's lined up uses you can hear it in interviews again and again ... you were saying is\nSo you say you know I'm opposed to feminism I think it's oppressive and they said well what you're saying then women can't work right you know what I'm saying you say that it would be loving you know to be a sock with your husband even if you're not entirely in the mood what you're saying it was meant to be able to write the book\nAnd you just think well wait how did what what machine\nBut what I say go through where it came out a full an awful lot and it's because they have a lot of something that a binary assumption that there's their opinion and we'll see I don't think they must think of the way the argue the most absurd things for for a million years people say oh there are many women\nI mean one day that becomes hateful it doesn't become it's not like somebody says to you know there are some ... kind of very feminine traits makes you uncomfortable with their bodies and you say huh you know like I can understand that could happen\nWhich makes it will some women have Peterson's get over it or you know how can you have that
