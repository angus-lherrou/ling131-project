it's for news is that we're completely nonpartisan I like covering the news an unbiased way but he has challenged people to think differently about issues rightly or wrongly and I think that that's really important for the civil discourse today whoever\nYou are so ... who's a born Saudi Arabia but war goes contribute to the Washington Post seems to have been lured into a crowd or the Turkish embassy\nAnd killed a there was word is we think he's dead they picked up ... and it was a big show up to the moon Saudi teams may have arrived in taking them out we're trying to get to the bottom of

now sir is in jeopardy now I Would I be\nOut front find out what happened I mean I Do I go out and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out what would I Would\nLet me read extremely tired with Saudi Arabians a ground print who's really running things that should not take too long and my ...\nWell listen and he asked if he wants that pasture out of turkey as well so the relationship with turkey is also tense right now two things I think about this story number one is a journalist operating freely in America I\nThink just should be a lesson to all journalists and all consumers of news there are so many people here stateside that complain about the treatment of journalists you want to know what what bad treatment of journalists go anywhere else other than America and that's what you're going experience I mean it's interesting that this happened\nIn Turkey one of the places that has the most journalists in prison than anywhere else in the world and yet this is this you know the Turks are coming on and saying you know Turkish government's\nComing on and in trying to take a stand because they're they're not happy with Saudi Arabia so there's a lot of different undercurrents here I don't know how big of a stand the president can take on this issue I mean obviously clearly it's bad I mean what happened to this journalists you see some of the graphic\nReports it's frightening um\nBut there's a lot I mean there are just a lot ten packed are really looking forward to your conversation with Senator Corker I just don't I don't know what the I don't know what the right call is for the president I think it I it offers a lot of perspective for those of us who value freedom of the press and really\nWant other journalists to be able to operate freely so we can all have an idea of what's accurately happening in the far flung places of the world I mean we really important for us from your top stories directly\nTo ... you know one of the big stories that was sort of I mean 'cause it's listen it's not the most exciting has been about ... you know gas prices that's been a really big ... you know the gas prices are in your for your highest we haven't seen the levels in oil and all of a long time and some I think this is an interesting fact Brian every recession in the last\nFive recessions has been\nPredated with a spike in oil prices so there you know you see what's happening with the markets and you see what's happening\nWith stocks and questions about interest rates and inflation oil as part of that so we're really taking a look at that and the president had an interesting announcement about wanting to make the fuel that is more\nMixed with ethanol corn byproduct available year round\nAnd they're you know there's a lot of strong feelings about that it can actually damage your car Brian I don't know if you knew that but some cars can actually take that blends and um so it's it's really it's kind of I think that this story that's happening with fuel and the economy as a really big one it's one that we're really covering this week on smart because it affects every part of our life even if you don't drive\nSo that's definitely one were watching\nAnd we'll see what's going on or economy doing good Bhutan give me ... going to do because the ruse interest rates because everyone will panicky but it's weird to help you you are as an economy the more the interest rates go up ... to go down\nThat makes people nervous just because it's a it's a way that makes them more expensive for us to borrow money you know but let's see it's hard to watch the markets every\nEvery other day you know you got to kind of take it in a month period and see what's happening but it definitely scared people and when people start throwing around the world word recession I think we have to be careful you have to do it responsibly we were nowhere it clear that near that were near full employment but you know we've been on a ride for a little while everyone's wondering when\nThey'll be a little bit of a breather and I think that that's a fair question to convey\nTo join us is going to launch with Jim Brown and the president you know to a prominent African American and wanted to do not want to bleed activists who was the president's agenda should be a who should be their agenda and there were two black communities agenda on looking back\nAnd uh the black vote over the last three ... three Republicans all are under twenty percent between Romney and Trump but no three ... actually got more than the other two\nYou ever see their rebalancing back to a party that actually breed this leads me to do you have the black vote up until Nineteen sixty\nI think when it comes to vote for anyone and whether they try and block voters women's vote or Hispanic voter is I think there's a tendency to just try to think about all of them at the you know\n... these very specific groups that have very specific needs and and a lot of ways divide all of us I think there's some fair you know there's some interesting analysis when you've got a big into the way people register to vote and whether or not they vote\nBut at the end of the day I think it's really about the economy for everyone and I'll be really curious what the what the on the results in the mid term election are when it comes to different categories based on ethnicity and then moving forward I just I I tend to believe that people are kind of affected equally when it comes to some of these major issues with the economy like and you\nCan I get a job can I take care of my kids and am I safe and those are really basic questions that everyone needs answered so [noise]\nYou know I I don't I think all of that it can change is it a long way of saying short short answer I think all and it's going to be changing and I don't think I'm\nJust like we've seen as you point out in history and different parties have represented different platforms I just don't think at anyone's dependable every party should be fighting for a vote and they should not take anything for granted\nOr would we are so how do we get smarter news\nSmarter news is a smart her smart

saying I have a lot of African American support a lot of developed over the last little while with Kanye coming out and he came out a long time ago from me but it was much less fashionable frankly\nThat was a Donald Trump joining us on Fox and friends today talking about race relations in the White House's Kanye West and the great Jim Brown will be joining him for lunch do do the Democrats actually fear the Republicans making inroads in the black community because they just seem to mock anybody that does\nThe number one selling really you know when they go low we\nMay\nGo low we that was just a credit corny\nBut have we heard enough of this that the attorney former attorney general the United States Department deputy attorney general Eric Holder in Georgia clearly trying to run for president by showing how ... so when we when they go low you kick them\nFreely when are we ever going to get civility back to politics I imagine that's part of the reason why Senator Bob Corker decide politics should be in his rearview mirror for now Senator Corker welcome back\nFine thank you\nSorry when some of this so uh I thought about you too because everyone is looking to you as somebody they are calling balls and strikes on Capitol Hill are being targeted by some of these protesters walking through the halls and now we have other leaders like Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder not calling for civility until they start winning elections\nHave things really gotten as bad as it seems\nMine would just add a reporter and an off the record discussion I'm\nYou know it does that and this person asked me what is the one thing that as you're leaving concern chew and\nIt's this issue and that is that for some reason a civil discourse as dissipating it going away it's it's all about who can screamed aloud us ... ... the biggest protest and I do think that as we watch it the sacrifices across our country\nThat Kavanaugh hearings really found things up for Republicans as people watched or just how people are acting\nAnd watched what was happening in the hallways where some people were sincere but most a lot of the people truly or just actors\nIf you will trying to catch people on a gotcha moment and I think that I think that's affecting the Senate races across our country\nI think that's affecting the Senate races across our country from our standpoint in a very positive way\nReally is is that what's happening in Tennessee because I Know you're friends with Phil bred to him and he's not known as a Democrat buyer brand but Marsha Blackburn has somewhat caught fire is that part of it\nAt arm's length on many issues that we deal with them all and there's an arrogance that has developed\nWith them over the last year and a half\nA an entitlement there's just something about the way they\nDeal with us now that is very very different you got this young leader who's\nA phenomenal from the standpoint of his vision and intelligence on talking about the crown France I mean what he wants to do in Saudi Arabia Brian as you know is there is nothing short of breath taking in a positive way but if you know nip it in the bud you know we know that torture chamber set up and and the Ritz Carlton\nHe's consolidated power power he's arrested his own family but\nIf you don't nip and the but the fact that you can't go around the world killing\nAmericans set a sense then who knows where next they go so\nWe got to have a very serious response to this and nip it now he can be around for another forty or fifty years\nTo US Senator Corker I Know you've already had a lot of success in business you wanted to come in and your idea of politics to service would you ah would you ever accept something in the Trump Administration\n[noise] you know who knows um ah you know they they discuss something with me three or four months ago and [noise] and uh it was a it was a you know certainly an honor um it wasn't a particularly tough assignment and you know

I'm like this was a tremendous honor I'm more of an executive as you know that as a legislative job but uh certainly uh when any president calls and ask\nYou to serve you have to sit down and and and

Andrew Jackson every other word every ticket you get the paperback version with a brand new afterward\nAnd in Nashville, Tennessee on the twentieth ... on the on the twenty first that'll be seven thirty I'll be able to talk about oh three books America great from the start is what we call it\nAnd therefore I can talk about three books how we got to the point where all these books were written George Washington secret six Thomas Jefferson the Tripoli pirates in Andrew Jackson miracle New Orleans\nYou also find out or what is in the works and has been for the last year should be done in about seven months or the other project to atomic streaming excited about\nSo does more than that over a right after those three events the book comes out on the twenty third and on friday I Will be in St Louis hopefully get everybody here from Ninety seven one listeners at seven o'clock can be at the St Louis library then it's off the next day Saturday there's twenty seven to Baton Rouge the

paperback away there or one o'clock in the afternoon Octavia Octavia books so be there now if you didn't write this down if you're driving round don't worry about it go to Brian kill me dot com it's all there\nDon't forget will be in Grand Rapids Michigan for the first time ever I'll be at the Ford museum talked to Gerald Ford actually are from my very first book\nAnd then issue of books on November\nSecond she'll be the Ford museum November first you'll see everything else out there also be in the Boston area is going to be exciting sure\nUm she's speaking to something that the left truly believe I'm voter suppression as I call it it's something that they think is happening as a ...\nThey call it it's something that they think is happening as it's not even a conspiracy theory for them and it's just the fact that Republicans are are trying to suppress people from voting Republican that they know we want more people to vote but we want people to register to vote and to do so legally\nAnd therefore that's why they're trying to like for example Nikki Haley in South Carolina when she was governor said\nA voter id actually will encourage more people to vote it will get more people into the system [noise] um anyway when Hillary as saying as a talking point that they use\nThat it might sound a little crazy to conservatives but Brian they truly believe that that's a good topic actually for me to do with Tucker next week\nFor that yeah it does do I don't mind you starting their conversation me going I was talking to Brian on the radio with that though I mean on the radio you as we used when I was I don't want them to use them another Brian right like I don't know who else would I possibly need a pretty much don't even need a good idea actually because the electoral college\nOne is not something that people talk about but they don't have a lot of them have a lot of the statistics behind them or the history behind them so that's what I tried to do with that and voter suppression in the issue of it\nI'll do that next week so there was a big story out today people making a big deal of Eric Holder saying what he should on top of what Hillary Clinton said there's no time for civility basically as long as we keep losing elections until we get the house or the Senate so do you have a problem with this\nTime for a Democrat\nTo me they are going to be an medicated as they are committed to say on\nThe show was you know when they go low we don't know [noise] they go low we can [noise]\n\nThat was the Democratic warnings about\nThe president on Fox and friends to the\nPeople that are very careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're discussing say but in America for him to make a statement of like that is a very dangerous say but you know they talk about\nUs we are exactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I I heard somebody else are they on your show actually don't care about my rallies semi rallies or really\nCalm and and will run and and packed with people we don't have problems that arose and I would say is that it wasn't so successful for those protesters\nBut that would be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous older shows\nSo I play that for Chris Wallace and he says I'm totally blown outta proportion that it is not a big deal with Eric Holder said Dana Perino way and you can usually\nServer I I'm an and looking at it so regardless of what I think Michelle Obama didn't like it right he was using her language and she said no no no that's not that's not what I meant that's not that's not what I'm for and she's trying to be\nThe leader that she wants to be and that she would like to have for the country I only way I didn't know that Michelle Obama weighed in or whatever and yeah and I only got on Twitter so I didn't see a lot but she was basically like oh now\nThat's not that's not where I Am I'm however I also think that there is a way you can blow things out of proportion for example when at all of the rallies Trump starts the chanting lock her up or or somebody starts at lock her up and and not that the president of it but\nAnd it's it's a a laugh line if you look at what Eric Holder's doing even trying to rally up a crowd small crowd and a little room but they all laughed and so\nI can I don't want to blow anything out of proportion I Am concerned do more about the deeds\nRight because Brian you know personally like it's not that most people say oh go harass people and they say nothing happens no but they're actually harassing people so for me when it turned boats from words the deeds that's\nA huge huge concern so everybody's talking about ah this pollution which has got a new procedure because of the United states uh put him on the nurse who Security Council\nAnd that's who's open chair now ... at the un and a lot of people have their candidates who I mean we've heard our Ryan Zinke huge in the air for for an interview or people who were brought up senator Ayotte I've thought Joe Lieberman might be blind for this\nBut also the leading candidate he just thought to be Dina Powell aren't you you would deal with Tucker Carlson to ... to ...\nPowell seems like a nice person wants people like her she the right person for the job that's the question\nWill she's worked on behalf of virtually every idea that President Trump who ran against him his two thousandth sixteen campaign\nFrom people remember said it was time for America to act on its own behalf for once internationally and to avoid pointless and counterproductive wars are losing a pound ... they are not before joining the Trump Administration she was a partner and Goldman Sachs she was president of Goldman Sachs foundation that the nonprofit arm of the investment back\nWhile they're short extensively with another family famous foundation the Clinton Foundation and they work together and various goals that most voters would find them\nShow me your thoughts on this well so\nUm I I get I'm agnostic as to who the president supports um I hadn't heard that Joe Lieberman one that's interesting but I think the president is going to want someone that he knows and trust that is really important to him\nSo the Ryan Zinke he uh take would make sense to me Dina power for him and I think that ... that he had something wrong here like she didn't work for the Clinton Foundation and actually the program that she worked on she created with called ten thousand women and it was a way to help\nYoung women entrepreneurs from around the world to figure out a way to become an entrepreneur self sufficient they did not use a dime of government money I'm pretty sure President Trump would like that there was no money\nPlus Dina Powell at the national Security Council actually wrote President Trump's national security strategy when that document came out it was widely praised\nBy most except for on the far left and one of the things that she focused on most is or what the president is concerned about and because I watch tiger I know he's concerned about the number one enemy of the United states identified as China\nAnd not the middle east on she was in Russia and she was really strong about pulling out of the Iran deal right supported the president on that so I think that um criticism about her on those things are probably a ... way back when when I first met her she worked for Newt Gingrich while\nI Do get two people write me thinks that she would be the best person for that job so and I don't think it's it's a it's it's I I don't think it's a small back to the Nikki Haley was a woman and I think that he could have more women and more minorities in his\nCabinet he knows her and she's worked for him on foreign policy\nAnd so he could trust her right now I think that that's really important I don't think that he could go with like a as an outsider like a Joe Lieberman because or even Kelly Ayotte who I think you know that because of the Gorsuch shepherding during the Supreme Court nomination but doesn't know her as well as he would know Edina power he used to brief him every day well and by the way\nKelly Ayotte for that to the Access Hollywood tape came out she says I Would not want him as a role model yeah I Know he got older the Nikki Haley snow but maybe that might be an issue I Hope it's not me more about your issue about Obama coming out to a hundred percent right the Daily Caller right to take the cold from there\nWho's Obama too cheap stands by her motto think Holder's alternative is not a proper message for children\nAbsolutely here's a quote here is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised or you want them to think about life in their opportunities do you want them to be a breed of their neighbors do you want them angry do you want them vengeful which model do you want them to live by and I have to think about that as a mother wow\nYeah that's pretty that's a really a strong ... pitch that's better at the better word a ...\n... pitch that better at the better word I ever ever ever view of the comments but the thing is Brian\nAsk the Democrats are just they're so frustrated because they can't find a message that's working they're always on defense and the base the progressive base things that they're not fighting enough\nThey think they should be more cynical meaner and it's not a great way to win elections even though they might be able to win back the house I don't think it puts them up while the wind back the Senate and I think they're in a real deficit going into twenty twenty\nSo a Bob Corker who is your son and I never ... he's always been pretty candid especially now that he's leaving he came out and said that he was offered a few weeks ago a opportunity joined the Trump Administration I Want to share this down by the electrodes and would you ever except for the Trump Administration\n[noise] you know who knows um you know they they discuss something with me three or four months ago and [noise] and uh it was a it was a you know certainly an honor um it wasn't a particularly tough assignment and you know as you know I mean yes of to me\nThis is all about public service if they're white tough assignment came up where you felt like you were making a difference ah certainly I Would never say never\nKind of interesting I didn't I didn't know that um I like the idea of people who want to continue to serve in some capacity even Nikki Haley the other day when she resigned said oh I'm going to be a part of something I don't know what it is it sounds to me like Bob Corker thing\nI'm I'm willing to do something but I Need a Sunday more challenge of bigger town I don't know what that would mean to him you know they have some of the special envoys\nAre that are working internationally on ... on some big issue that that might be something that he would be interested in I don't necessarily think thinking cabinet secretary that might be a little hard for the Trump Administration to swallow but no never say never say never\nRight and you know I I again he they said that he is just itself is a president he's got a different demeanor and he used to work in the field and you got to be tough as nails\nYou want to equal opportunity land\nWe're the talk of

things that I haven't voted to you all for many years together\nWhy I Believe there will be violence from the left especially if they lose the congressional elections it's possible even if they win the further the problem\nAnd that is the connection between high self esteem which the left has more than the writer I don't mean every single individual\nBut\nSelf esteem is I Am better\nI better not my ideas I Am better\nThan all those I differ with and I am a I Am better\nIn that I mean this is more important\nIn that I mean this is more important than normal middle class Sybil are the rules do

who are you\nOr me I can murder you who are you on me I can rape you who are you I can you know you're nothing\nThat's why they're there are there are offended when they're arrested there just offended I Can't believe it who the hell are you to arrest me\nAll right now Julie Julie are you in Alaska\nMatter of fact I'm an artist\nAh right so we got to teach our screener that eight K. is Alaska a are is Arkansas okay\nWell I'm going to be more professional right\nNow no no no don't be sorry it's a it's a tough call whether the screener deserved the living martyr does not think uh she deserved to be in this case I don't know it was great yeah we we are truly egalitarian and whom we punish okay go ahead I'm Sorry Julie\nJulie are you there [laughter]\nLike what happened maybe she was offended that never happens\nUsually when you hear me yeah oh what happened okay I don't know about I have\nI been fine I I guess I'm having trouble with the ... were highly hot our children to have\nSelf esteem knowing that that you are comfortable who you are in fact that was something I said almost every day to them remember he made all the different things meaning you're a child a God and you are part of their family so um I guess\nWe have very high self esteem and I always hire and fire someone different greener yelling at me or not agreeing with me if it's truly sample lot I mean\nIt doesn't really bother me I'd never thought of myself as long as I wrote in any way but I can guarantee you I have a lot of things so that I\nWant to elaborate on or you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids are on losing teams\nWhich they did go to\nCourt case so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be bored with mine one is that there is when you said I Want you to know your child with God I couldn't agree with you more that's not the self esteem that the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like\nNot that they they don't walk around thinking I Am a child of God I promise you\nKnow okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain pressure ... that is unique to every one of us I I I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe that\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am a terrific\nI don't think you told your children you are terrific and ... you know okay there you are even laughing now that so that that proves my point so they're at the other is you believe I I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er into self esteem\nI totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think highly or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing yeah okay so I think on board on that the self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself no matter how you behave\nIrrespective of religion vast couldn't tell us grew up Catholic got very angry at his Catholic upbringing rejected it this is a secular self esteem yours is religious self esteem\nI think there's a big difference\nI don't see evangelical

professors of psychology but hard self esteem a greater the likelihood of violence\nOf the reasons that I Believe that left to be increasingly violent Mike doesn't agree so we get so I'm immediately Cleveland, Ohio Mike hello\nI Can't say that people think there's a period are more prone to violence that you are describing Donald Trump through the G\n... here and everybody else how he doesn't have to follow the rules are for our president is what a better businessmen but it better to go she ... and even for the whole reality encourages people to buy that offers to pay for that cost if they are violent\nOkay now wouldn't have been allowed to return to earth which\nOK Now let's return to earth which\nIs the one that stops people from eating a burns cars breaks office buildings closes bridges in closest tunnels conservatives or left us\nWhich are pretty good how are people who put my arms and Oklahoma State in Atlanta Georgia spending John Lewis this is our shirt political any church trials\nRight and there are there are there are no question okay there's no question that there had been individual despicable people from the right I couldn't agree with you more talking about mass violence as in closing ... do you think that it's a violent act to clip the bridge\nWell oh okay so we have a different view of Iowa I'm stopping you from driving is not a violent attack no in fact ... it's a non violent act you I Am pretty violent ... non violent\nSo I'm curious whether or not or if you're\nThere look I think two people can honestly differ on this issue so walk by preventing you from getting to your destination\nOr including a hospital is is if it's it's a physical act you can't you can't go through any longer but it's non violent so it's the same as people going into a park and peacefully protesting you don't see a difference\nThough it's a famous people going into a restaurant because they were black and not letting people go into that restaurant in half\nBy the way just just to remind you were speaking I think in twenty eight team you're speaking in Nineteen sixty or fifty three I I Know that you see this is a problem to what I'm Talking about the ... people are blacks prevented from being a being served in restaurants today\nI'm Talking about the situation there was no violence there were not during the violent act when they sat at those restaurant\nI I Am in the in the middle right okay so it was more right okay hold on island ... alright ... to ... to serve a block at a restaurant I ... was it immoral to serve a block in a restaurant\nYeah is it immoral to close the bridge\nWell okay All right one of the beauties of the show is we don't yell at each other\nAnd then we reached a moment of clarity\nAnd life is good\nI don't cut it\nI just want to say for the record if pro life protesters closed a bridge I Would say was a moral\nRight\nPro Israel demonstrators taking things that I have talked about and feel strongly about demonstrate disclose the bridge you can't go across the George Washington bridge 'cause we are for Israel\nWhich is what are you out of your mind\nGet the hell out of here with the traffic go\nBut of course you can't imagine it right pro Israel demonstrators closed down Washington, George Washington Bridge Bay Bridge no longer operating\nIncidentally do you realize you know it's it it and that's why I by the way the word violence is\nNosy perfect definition there may not be one stopping you from doing something\nIf I if I didn't punch you\nWill be in the realm of it certainly in the realm of the physical you can't get to your flight that flight might be taking you to your daughter's wedding that flight might\nOr to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota that flight may be taking you for a job interview upon what your income depends\nCause black lives matter my causes more important than all of you but hey we're non violent when not even a moral according to my last call her",
