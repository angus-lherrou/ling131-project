Jason men Jones I say they marine guards men go home or in a leaders who he's\nCalled leaders myth and reality and you went back in history to make sure you had it right and you had a confession earlier you didn't have everything right in the first two weeks to leadership bugs or you learn more\nWell we certainly didn't have some things right now I thought about leadership and so we went back to look at these Thirteen leaders in history and to see what about them we didn't really understand that so we did these pairs of genre we did geniuses and reformers founders\nPower brokers and we tried to look at Thirteen fairly diverse leadership experience just by people and see what it is leadership really is\nGoing to throw it was so mad at you please silos who could Walt Disney what do we learn from all dizzy struck down with cancer early probably would have been even bigger in greater but man his legacy lives on in his name has never been stronger what did he do\nWell it was extraordinary some very talented animator in his early years she created this studio they created Mickey Mouse and really technological breakthroughs\nBut then from Nineteen thirty four thirty seven he drove his team to produce Snow White the first full linked animated feature and it was extraordinarily successful even though he had to mortgage company and mortgage the eye Peter Mickey Mouse to fund the picture\nWhen it was hugely successful\nFor years later we as a bitter strike for many of those same animators because the company had grown has gotten more corporate structure and the bureaucracy had changed and suddenly the kind of leader he ended up smaller more family like company\nShe couldn't do here and he couldn't grow we couldn't adapt to that new reality show what really happened is just brother Roy ran the corporate side of the Disney studios from then on Walt Disney focused on things like Disney laughed so he was great in imagining things and focusing on ... projects\nHis brother became great at running of baking part so\nIf Stanley McChrystal was looking at Walt Disney in his forties thirties and forties [noise] do you try to get more due to try to broaden out Walt Disney or you just try to get somebody with a skill set to match the problem\n... that's a great question I think the first thing you do is try to get Walt Disney to adapt but there's some people who can't or just are not interested in adapting and then what you gotta ... says he's not the right leader for the new reality at the Disney studios and then you bring somebody in a way\nA little bit like apple emerging Lewis Steve Jobs was basically an insurgency at a company that he created when he came back he even said he was better suited for that job\nWhen I get ... to a group the leader is all in context the followers and the situation determine their leaders effectiveness Margaret Thatcher\nShe was strong convictions believe very strongly and certainly conservative ideas because she was so unwavering and that she became very very appealing to the British she went through the very difficult Nineteen seventies she became a very popular prime minister and then after about eleven years\nThe arc of her leadership she became more autocratic the vary from confidence style she had before began to wear fan on people and she was essentially politically assassinated now it wasn't that she had lost that it was that the times had changed\nThe context it changed her followers had gotten where were you ever style and they essentially pushed aside\nI hate to boil everything down to sports but how many great coach you hit the ten year mark coach in the same team and just all of a sudden they don't listen they stop listening need a change and the next

doing it as a broadcast to when he had all that suggests uses a guide tablets and to me part cell seems to move on the year before he has to cause he senses they heard my act before\nI think that's true plus there's always the danger that the leader starts to thing they've got all the right answers they've had the success that here the press they start to believe there's really smart they lose their humility and I think that makes you less adaptable\nI Will never use my ... a gentle I become more questions where catch up on the other side of the book as leaders go grab it while you can it's a great idea for Thanksgiving leading up to Christmas or whatever holiday you celebrate\nKnow I don't think in uniform you should do that and I think that the military have to be very particularly

McRaven any operates on values\nAnd you are not a fan of the president is that safe to say well I think\nAnd you are not a fan of the president is that safe to say\nWell I think I think we as Americans have got to decide what kind of person we want in the presidency and not argue about who it is now or who is gonna be next we had to go back ... first principles and say what do we want our president to be how much integrity\nHow much forthrightness help how smart we want a more kind of experience and I think if we did that if we had a conversation on that in America we might come to a different appraisal of our current president but also who need for the future\nAnd how do you explain that forty seven percent a popularity\nWell I think it's not very difficult to pluck people's emotions to play to people's emotions on different issues and so I'm a little bit of a skeptic on some of the polls either way but I Would say that we need to make sure that we don't\nConfuse popularity with what we need to take it up best teacher your coach you had in high school it may not have been the one you enjoy the most at the time or you love the most part you sort of look and say

really interesting number one that has the president's approval rating at forty seven percent basically higher than President Obama's at the time and that\nHappened [laughter] the question it was like six months or six point net gain for him over the last month\nAnd a ... this is a good trend for Republicans with just a couple of weeks left me obviously as you said um you know we don't try and focus on too much on any individual poll one poll\nBut yet drawn to Sanders who promises in the same policy seems to be struggling\nIs that temporary or does the mayor from Tallahassee you're going to walk away with this\nWell they they had the debate last night um and you know they were both sort of getting after each other it's it's going to be interesting to see how this works out I mean we've had for example in in the Senate race though real quickly we had a poll come out yesterday a CNN poll showing\nA Bill Nelson up five we had a poll come out this morning showing Rick Scott I Want to look at another poll coming out about two and a half hours\nI'm so Scott Nelson's leading by about a point to half an hour average that the Senate race is really close um it was really close I think Rick Scott\nGiven his name id his money how he's doing with hurricane relief all of that um he's hanging in there killing seems to be moving moving ahead of the status and so the question is whether again it'll all come down to turn out if he's able to generate the same turn out in the south or the ... during the primary which was off the chart\nAnd he's got a good shot at becoming the first African American governor for\nThis and that that would be great historic but a guy that going to raise your taxes has an FBI investigation is donated by specifically a terrible job in Tallahassee how the heck you win and that's a recipe for a loss\nHey look this is where this is where the the the Democratic base is this is the guy who was excited the Democratic base in Florida right he's he's excited act progressive all across the country\nAnd he's very charismatic he's run a very good campaign you saw him last night um handling these attacks what does that mean he is a pseudo operator any ... any any he does do a good job of sort of couch and his message in a more centrist um you know\nMore centrist language than than a lot of a lot of far left progressive as do and again he's he's full on you know single payer healthcare abolish ice all that stuff and which you would not think would would play well in a state of Florida which is very much a purple state very much put down the middle\nBut he's done a good job of packaging that as a way that seems to be palatable at least to end up voters right now where he's he's got a an advantage of this right\nSome just doesn't make sense there Tom Bevan fascinating will talk to you again thank Tom Hi Brian I'm we come back we're you about the phones and kill me\nHe's Brian kill made [noise]\nYou know what's not smart job sites

let's help the refugee I'm not from this country ... let's let's let's call them what they are they all and illegal yeah they're they're they're breaking our laws and the president is finally\nGoing to cut off and maybe you're going to cut off aid to ... maybe even ...\nOr ... or keeping everyone brain to meet you do with this child or your destination that story next\nI Would want to the\nSaudi Arabia has a very long memory as does the United states and Saudi Arabia is the leading patron of Islamic ideology friend unless the Brotherhood along with Qatar from him we had very little but we'll showing the relishing the themes\nUm so this is a very very troubling in many ways that that that will power like turkey wouldn't ... making war critical alliances at this time\nIn history I Want you to me that ... that doesn't mean Brian that I that I sanction the killing of this journalist I think that the ... is that so I didn't have never rendition he didn't deserve the debt but there has been made not similarly would buy Turkey's decision\nWell yeah but I mean it's still fundamentally it's who shouted decision that turkey is making the most of it might have a heads up and it was happening so the Saudi foreign minister who is a long time about ... to the United states a bill ... friends who\nAre very capable diplomatic very Tejpal ... guy very highly educated women wrote them and\nSo I Want you to Iran should here's where Brett one guard asked him what would you could go down to\nSaying that the crown prince wrong with them so long to not know about this\nDid not know about this\nBecause of all this money would come home and some of them to try to cover all the time to go from one coming through the through the ones who are functionally with someone who has a few years\nAgo\nI mean I think that's a very reasonable assessments a a a a different matter of a bill ... stature\nWhich would be enormously informed about the critical stakes is the relationship not just in general but now\nSaudi Arabia his face and die investment of international dollars and twenty sixteen I'm twenty Seventeen before this happened oil revenue is down by sixty seven ... than it used the over three hundred billion dollars annually now it's barely scraping by a hundred and ten billion dollars annually I guess you'd call ...\nMore than somebody could stand to under the age of thirty unemployment is up to twenty five percent in ... double that in women they cannot afford this\nSo I I I have activity I understand from prince Mohammed bin ... rounded up the most powerful figures in the Saudi royal family I understand he did that I guess what we want not\nMaking an outcry of that even when all very good Saudi friends were involved people hold shows in your employer twenty first century Fox or in Twitter orange ...\nWe did not complain about the apprehension of print all where he'd been to law but he but to think that he would have conducted such a botched operation on a journalist is such a relatively normal stature it's conceivable and I do agree\nThere seems to be a lot of bad decisions and they sell ... a lot of bad cover up a lot of bad exit\nThis is not how extraordinary rendition or targeted assassination is commonly carried out but the key is I feel almost as if\nIf there's a lot of history and the United states to try and an economic sanctions Saudi Arabia to pull back from the U.S Saudi relationship we will be shooting ourselves in the foot and I can't help the United states in kingdom is walking into a trap laid albeit maybe by Saudi stupidity\nBut we just don't want to get into that kind of crisis on some of the loudest schools the economic sanction\nI've come from the very members of Congress and Senate who I Am no benefit ... not only by Saudi funded\nWashington lobbyists to invest in last year alone twenty seven million dollars\nInto lobbying campaigns and political action campaign for the same politicians who are now calling for economic sanctions but also um the the the the the the enormous economic and political full that what happened to our country with a combination of that and I'm a contract\nTo do this eh the entire of what's going on between the United states\nAnd Saudi Arabia in our political space here in America is always\nPlays through the prism of President Trump and Jared Christian and it's been a huge attempt to vilify President Trump and Jared Kushner even more I make this all about them and that is activity on fat and inaccurate any other time in history and we will be all that we have an orthodox Jewish men on a\nSaudi Arabian Muslim print so closely allied that they're planning to economic future of of the region that would be of course his celebration so there's this tremendous political capital in making this worse than it is\nComing from modern history we hope never to have you on the fringe festival for us we'll be punished\nBut to him or he says he never being involved in it and we'll find out who it is and there'll be a fall guy out there were other other Merrill politicians who believe\nThat nothing is done without the crown prince and he's shown these easy shown a ham had in this in the way has conducted some operations in Yemen the way he jail the Lebanese leader\nOr and even would happen at the rich Carlton so maybe ... ... ... what about people who there is somewhat of a pattern wellbeing\nThere's truth in what you're saying that nobody nobody has centralized power in in a bigger of a Saudi royal the white crown prince Mohammed al ... has now\nHe's deputy prime minister is chief of economic developments on his chief of the royal court and now he's also head of the private investment fund which was the solving wealth and said that that may front loaded but they want us to really build in order to help with the divested occasion without a economy he has more power\nThan confide in Nineteen Seventy five who put centralized power in Saudi Arabia so this guy is beyond imagination and to have this power he\nFind that most of his opposition I agree I agree with that\nToo and I don't know if you're almost out loud to you know so much about and so many objectives in which and everybody's personal interests you still have dumped you're almost thinking inheriting this out out loud so much of the view\nThat that is number one the journalists to have known that he was the topic rendition when he Celtic styled himself and he's still even people that were giving economic advice conflicting with the the opinion of from print a crown prince ... the film on\nA were put in jail so he had to know if he stayed in the ... and he was going to go to jail he had to know that they could be a chocolate extraordinary rendition that tissue extraordinary rendition the United states we do a lot of it unfortunately I was nine eleven in that era era and as a physician lately they use today she stopped breathing\nQuite possible looking at his bailed now these knuckleheads well during this operation thought that they would not be saying I Want it to them and nobody would you know I could understand the logic and I could understand the crown prince not getting involved in those ...\nAnd ... dark dark but he also brought a corner with them to carve the who does autopsies whose group yeah we had a car bomb up we saw\nYeah this is absolutely first of all it's absolutely troubling second of all the tapes the Turkish security what's already been released I haven't listened to them but have been described in ... it's like a scene out of reservoir dogs I mean really terrible so this is troubling but again\nI don't know that that proves crown prince Mohammed bed goes that was the only saw this meant to him while he's alive and make sure that you create a global jihad political incident while you're doing I just cannot believe that conference bonded meal then come on is so powerful\nThat I think he could still be doing extraordinary rendition of troublesome individual which speaking I think he is enormously\nPower All right I Want you to you and I do agree on what you hear what Senator Dick Durbin wants to do twenty six\nThrough we want to do and we're going to do more and more than we are expo former ... bills for from the church ... completion of a third party investigation\nAfter the murder and God Knows what followed that occurred in trouble as your caller was to do the most the Saudi kingdom understand from ... countries around the world are going to reject this conduct\nAnd make sure the prepare approach for the companies are doing it\n[noise] okay so I think not reckless to say that and in fact I was on a Russian writer yesterday and the rush into thinking for hypocrisy\nLook at the accusations 'cause the nova chalk as a as a fascination in London and dozens of Russian diplomats expelled why isn't that happy totally reckless we must have been his side of the fact that Saudi Arabia is our ally\nThe Saudi Arabia is our ally even though we do believe this gentleman was terribly treated as human rights were violated international law was broken we agree with that but we don't get me to make a crisis was and frankly\nNobody has said what the United States has been doing post nine eleven you know President Obama\nOrdered many targeted assassinations with just right when drones including of an American citizen I Believe they deserve the death penalty and wild wacky but why didn't we didn't get the democracy extradite him and put him in the electric chair\nInstead of driving in with the help I met the highly Yemen and then coming back in ... year old\nSon was American so you know we had it both ways I Know I Would be in the game\nAnd ... come out of crisis it would make it more difficult to resolve this and the other thing that deeply angers me I'm really angers me it shows the okay he was making important idea it was an important voice but we did not terminate relationships we talk is
