Parker welcome back to the dentist Prager show\nOkay ... thanks for having me\nWhat is your thesis as to the how well known in America is the economic\nYeah that's a great question um yeah for someone like me calling on a daily basis I like the all day long how great things\nEli basis I can relate to you all day long how great things are they can get out there in you know in the you know outside of the news\nCycle and people just aren't getting the positive message of what's happening there hearing about a lot of other uh we'll call him distractions from the economic news\nUm of how well things are going and I you mentioned my op ed thank you so much\nUm I I I actually wrote an op ed\nAbout how women are getting into the economy as a result of the deregulation and the tax cuts in jobs back and we're seeing more women not only in the workforce\nBut more women taking that\nRisk and starting businesses um and all of the\nThings that are you know and and the unemployment rate for women is that a half century blow 'em and and now we're seeing today with the new jobs numbers a three point seven percent unemployment rate both the overall unemployment rate and the unemployment rate for women are at a half century while\nWe can see that as a headline right now we don't\nLive we don't we don't shoot period which is you know part of what the president is recalling the fake media rejoicing within it\nYou know go on I was just going to say that's why the the job creators network is doing this a national poor called tax\nCuts work we have been visiting the throughout the year um we're just about to launch our final phase of the tax cuts work Torre and we're going from city to city we will have completed fifty stop in twenty five feet by the end of October\nAnd we're a meeting with a congressional representative and small business owners and community leaders and business leaders and getting the word out to the media and to the public how these tax cuts are impacting small business and how much they're helping small business in general\nUm you know our members are ... we represent main street small business owners and they're telling us that they are raising wages and that there are ... they are investing in their business we have a a small female ... main factor that I highlighted in my op ed\nNicole Nicole walther in Illinois She owns a small manufacturing firms\nAnd she's not only taking advantage of the tax deduction a small business tax deduction but you can also immediately expense\nEquipment investment so she buying a half a million dollar piece of machinery and she can hire three people to operate it was a real job making real money and and and and investing more in to our economy and that's why we're seeing GDP at Fort Fort Point two percent\nRight and and people don't know that with the with the tax cuts there's more tax revenue going to the government\n\nThat is absolutely true we are seeing an increase in the tax revenue to the treasury um because of the increase in economic activity and and that's fantastic people are keeping more of their own hard earned money\nUm because of the tax cuts and the the changes in the withholding tables and they're spending it they're going on vacations and they're buying things and they're they're investing in their children's college education and more things stock market rise\nAll of these things are happening as a result of the tax cuts the regulation\nOverall optimism about the future and the only thing that we need to do now is it got little\nLittle news but uh the ... the house voted on tax cuts to point out last friday and now it's headed to the Senate and that will make the tax cuts permanent for small business and individual 'cause right now they are set to expire and twenty twenty five\nAnd we need to give predictability to our small business owner so they can continue doing what they're doing and investing in this economy\nMale folks you can help okay
