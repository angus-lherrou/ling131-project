I think what it's doing to help the Arizona honor guard share with our listeners because they're totally great\nIsn't that awesome so Finley auto uh it has offered to sponsor us with a fundraiser that they're doing this month where they're going to give us a pro se portion of their their of sales for their car sales in the months to go towards purchasing a passenger van\nFor the central Arizona on a guard which is the ceremonial unit for the fire department\nAnd uh that will be able to use that for our travels to support our mission to on the phone and on all the flack\nSo if I deal with this because it's fabulous\nActually we have been a ... you know trying to raise money and looking for opportunities to to ah get a passenger van for those purposes for some time and our fire chief chief Scott price tag actually\nRan into a Greg calling him from Toyota\nAnd um they shook hands and said yell at me and we talked it over a couple of times in the family was all in and they're super supportive so\nIf you go into Finland a purchase of vehicle part of the the proceeds from that will go to our part of their profits from that will do don't be known any to the central Arizona honor guard for the month of October\nSo do you guys know where you are yet we're here we\nAre ... have you know I you know in ... when everybody's busy schedule it's been hard to kind of meet up and trying

I'll tell you what we care deeply about the people of this community what goes on in this community and so we're trying to reach out to everyone does and tried to put things together that will drop people together\nAnd make some very very proud of where they live who they live with\nAnd just bring good things I mean it's a with so much news in the negative sense in the world today\nI think it's great to live in small communities or smaller communities and be and know your neighbor and and be around your neighbors and help your neighbors and I think you two previous guests are pretty much nailed it on the head with both of the things that are doing the risk to be a part of it I'll be honest with you so you're in front\nOf me I was just gonna say who's going to have his hands full because they're in this community there are so many volunteers that are doing so much good for the community he's going to have to Wade through at all and decide which one he wants to report in Jordan\nHe needs to be put on all of them not going to tell you that he than the\nFirst courier care the meant live with a couple of weeks ago three weeks ago when you were washing cars in was that

and the people were thrilled to death and it shows you that care element you know a lot of times when you use care\nHow much do you really care if I drive my car through my dirty car will you clean it

nine point nine FM K. two sixty me Ella Prescott\nThe mountain Gardner is paid for by waters garden center and it's only responsible for its content\nWelcome to the mountain gardener on Cape Cod name with local garden expert Ken Lane mountain gardening can be challenging can tip certain things are meant by you'll reap huge reward now welcome your can lane\nWelcome you tuned in to the mountain gardeners this is your host Ken Lay in doing this a lotta years together\nWe just share about ah the cycles what's going on in your landscape here in the mountains of Arizona and a lot of our current content the garden advice that we get at the higher elevations none of it's coming from here\nIt's beamed in through HGTV or east coast or mid west where most of the production of garden contact comes from books written from there that shows the radio that they're from over there of course that's where all the bodies are\nFrom Washington DC north to Boston to cook it over to to ah to to Chicago and all of a sudden you've got most of the countries people live there and if you're going to create a book you want to write for them not for the how how many people live in northern Arizona\n... half million maybe there's no one up here and so that's why we live here we get to be more secluded we can go into the forest and not have to bump into people\nSo we get some space we can breathe the elevation is just the air is cleaner brighter the pace is lower and that's why we love\nThe mountains of Arizona and so if we do get some garden content that's from Arizona it's usually from Phoenix or Tucson so Tucson because our university agricultural school is you may go wild cats\nAnd all the bodies in all the students go to school a shoe or Phoenix metro area and so that's where the TV stations are so you get these\nNews outbreaks that to kind of a an Arab world cheers other Republican senators to prove your palm tree the second year palm tree and the and the content you know it's not for you if you live up in the mountains\nSo we don't grow palm trees that we don't grows up here we don't grow up ... we don't grow big fig trees we have some shrubs that are hard enough to grow here but not trees\nAnd we don't grow crepe Myrtle trees we grow shrub ... there are certain varieties that are hard here that that uh they can act more like a perennial if we do go subzero really cold cold cold nipple back to the ground and they come back fresh\nEvery year from the ground like a perennial and so they never quite get up the side you know there are some over in the ... area there's some bigger ones over there so it's more but the southern folks I Want I don't want crab apples I don't want to believe plum I don't want flowering cherry tree\n... believe plum I don't want flowering cherry trees I watch quite Myrtle trees and they just they just don't perform the cold ... back in the south you know Dallas uh east you can have beautiful but not not here\nAnd so we try to get that information out for the mountains of Arizona the best advice I can give you right now\nIs don't give up on gardening it's still going to leave that irrigation on that even though we had a storm a couple of weeks ago you still don't want to be watering them out once a week for established plant ... these\nAre things that have been on the ground for over a year a couple of years or so or more they've got to fully mature root structure its its new you just planted it two three four six months ago this year\nThen you're probably watering that a couple of times a week and I'm Talking trees and shrubs maybe vines the bigger rooted stuff ... if you're talking about pansies\nYour your kale that new lettuce crop you just put in carrots ad that that's a little different because they're shallower rooted sea water mold and more often but even now I'm I'm scaling back my watering but I'm not turning it off and continue to nurture\nMy plants this week I've given my some of my plants a hair cut their just they've grown a lot they'd been happy they loved all the moisture urban fertilizing well they're happy they're healthy that color is good\nThey're almost too happy so I've got Eli Agnes up against the house as an under planting they're getting too big so I gave them a quick haircut none of full I didn't really you know lack of back and a half I just the long run or is that gets nip those off I hear a trim you do most of your\nThe pruning and the dead of winter January February march you wait till things are cold\nYou don't want to prune too much here this is this is mainly for you desert folks tropical climate areas you folks from Hawaii a for from Kelly California the southern Arizona folks you folks you want to hold off you you are used to pruning roses back in November ... when we always do it\nDon't do that here you'll blunder your way to failure\nIf you do that to keep that structure up on those plants as best you can cause that insulate the heart of that plant\nSo if we go really cold and you'd never know with the mountains are going to deliver can be dry can be wet can be snowstorm after snowstorm could be warm could be it you never know what it's going to be but you can't go wrong by leaving that structure intact\nSo leave that alone then you prone after the new year after the harshest in wait for a nice break day by\nBy Valentine's the middle of February the weather's getting pretty nights at that point yeah we can have some frost yes we can get a snowstorm or two after that\nBut the weather's getting pretty nice you want to be outdoors at that point and that's when you want to start pruning things 'cause you print or right before they start a elongated it'll start growing start budding out\nUh so do late printing now it was encroaching end of the walk with the patios a potato Weiner's going crazy it just needs to be just crawling all over the patio it needs to be cut back\nAnd so we just trim a little bit I did fertilize before that storm at a couple of weeks ago I fertilized everything here at the garden center I fertilized every ... at the at the house\nI Want to make sure that food gets down in there some time in October you want to make sure that fertilizer you want to really put an an a a nutrient rich fertilizer on the ground so as the plants root there they're actively Rudy right now as the leaves change they root out through the end of the year\nYou could fertilized and you'll get a chubby or stronger sadder route so they're heartier they hibernate to better\nAnd that's the food they're going to use to form the buds for next spring form new flower buds on your fruit trees euros budget on your roses new strawberries new it's going to use that to form a new growth to this is the most important feeding the years in October\nSo I just took advantage those are two main things\nThat I've done a and then as my plants give up a so some like tomatoes I no longer have a tomato in the ground\nI harvested them all there were down and they were kind of they were just big overgrown and the production was there but it wasn't like it was two months ago man I could pick up enough of them\nAre the cucumbers I Can't picture can't eat any more I don't want anymore cucumbers the matinee so I just want okay that's enough that's put it in some kale because I Love juicing Kate Hi loves lettuce fresh out of the gardens oh it's so good my mouth just watering thinking about it oh\nMan radishes you can put in now and they'll growth you just had a little bit of garden space a few seed and all of a sudden you've got this beautiful crop of broccoli for Thanksgiving dinner ah brussel sprouts for Christmas dinner you can have that\nThe season is so long growing cycle so long here in the mountains that you have to know what is my cycle so your cycle is in in March you've got a whole planting season of cool season things\nMothers' day typically use all your summer things that's when you put your tomatoes ... your geraniums in\nAnd then right now you're starting to plant another cool season like you would in March it's another cool tease him planting season and then by then you're just tired and\nYou don't

Gardner with local experts can lane mountain gardening can be challenging but with Ken hipster things aren't anti you'll read huge rewards now welcome to the mountain Gardner so\nHere's a little trick I learned that in school about which I raised my family at least in I raise their\nKids in school belly little tiny ranch down fifty miles north of Prescott some between just before Kirkland\nThat area so it's it's in that area is beautiful ranch land we live right on Kirkland creek the kids could roam we are on ten acres surrounded by nothing but ranch we could see no one near our house it was just concerning sometimes 'cause kids would go and you're going to wonder where they're at I Know I Wonder if they're safe I've no idea [noise]\nAh so but they always had max the German shepherd and bought a chocolate lab and wherever those kids when they were right there and so you always have confidence they were they were ... chief or cattle away or\nWere there we had elk and we had deer tick lots of a well so I had not lions and bears and everything else\nSo everything you could think of was there a pack rats to squirrels to rabbits to do everything was there and so I learned a few tricks\nAnd one I had the deer come in and they were appealing to bark off of my walnut ... once you're seen show up at the grocery store now all those nuts a great big wallet was that we'd pecans\nAnd so the wall that's the the deer tick a fancy too and sometimes they'll do this to aspens sometimes I'll do this to any fruit tree especially apples and pears that's her favorite they'll go in and do rubber antlers on the bark and it'll start peeling\nOff the bark underneath the bark certain trees taste very sweet ... after all that nutrient moisture and taste sweet tastes underneath the bark\nThis was very frustrating this wall that was quite large and I did not watch the dear to kill it or girl it if they repeal off the bark too much\nWhat I did and this is not in any book you're not going to see this on any website is just you and me talking over the airwaves and this one worked in my own back yard to keep the deer off\nI'm going how am I going to ... how am I going to do this what I did is is I took some bird knitting a following me with us some black plastic burdening you know one inch squares you use it a cover fruit trees hats\nAnd that and you know one inch squares you use it a cover fruit trees I had it it was right there when\nI Wonder if I loosely wrap this around the trunk and staple gun it to the bark\nAnd just let this this netting kind of float around this work where they were eating I Wonder if this would keep 'em off and boy did it ever work\nThey didn't try to touch that thing once after put that on there I just didn't know what to do this I didn't wrap it real tight I just loosely led up to three times around\nWhen around took virtually no netting staple ... what you think would hurt a tree but trees don't even feel that do their parents shaved off the rest and they never came back to that treat appeal the bark off I think that same exact technique could work for Apple's your aspens\nWillows there after ... woods are certain things they really like ... if you've got deer pressure coming after your trees turn appeal that bark off don't let them do that 'cause they can kill kill off that trunk\nI think it might even worked for porcupine\nSo if you see bark peeling off real low to the ground usually in the first foot or so there's a there's a porcupine that roam around\nOnly at night they're nocturnal they'll come and they'll just parks sit right in front of a tree the love fruit trees and peel off the bark they'll do that to ... I've seen sometimes I'll get up and do the crotch the tree they'll crawl the tree\nSit down on a main branch and just sit there and you'll see the bark peeled off\nRight where this ranch was coming off if you see that this is serious if the girl the tree that can actually kill it and so I think you do the same thing by ... ... ah just loosely very loosely wrapping that\nA ... bird netting around that probably ... probably any kind of nothing would work just I didn't want it to be obvious\nI wanted it to blend into the landscape so didn't look like oh what what do you do there what do you read the paper on his trunk what's going on and it looks funny\nThe black you're hardly even see it doesn't even show up\nAnd so if you get a lot of peeling bark peeling off of that tree then you want to come in and talk to us and we'll we'll show you how to clean it up cycle wound\nYou want to clean it up you can't really ... or so at ... or the staples into it but you can't actually clean up the the the the wound spray it with some black printing paint and wrap it\nAnd that will basically help the tree he'll over keep the insects out of that ... that one where the park was being peeled off we can help you that we can go deep with that because we see it so often\nAnd so that's that's something that happens I here's another little one I found I'm In my lawn I had little tiny cone shaped holes in the long ago what the heck is going on who is eating my lawn and so it's perfect little cones it'd be like a dozen of them\nOver this little section of the grass when what the heck is I've seen this in gardens so little tiny holes almost looks like a\nI don't know how to describe ... just a cone shaped in the dirt\nAnd I found out that was skunk they were going after the grubs in my lawn and so they could smell that grow up and they could they know where does it take their little tiny pause\nDig open they make that little tiny cone shaped a an underground signed the grab sip it up you know ... ... ... was another one so I had all these all dozens of rude counter to come back every night\nAnd make more of them I put a grub killer down over the lawyer that garden area to lawful lawns

rewards now welcome to the mountains Gardner\nLet's talk about some plants that are absolutely immune to to animal pressure so there's some that are more than others now plant adapt\n... over the generations and generations of plans for thousands and thousands of years have been adapting morphine they're putting in chemicals in their sap\nTo taste bad or so like you for be is no animal is ever going to mess with the euphoria it's related to appoint set up the breakup appointed a branch of see this white Milky south come out animals don't like that\nSome animals are like uh don't like a fuzzy textured leaf\nSo as you look closely at let's say sycamore you'll see the top of the leaf is green the bottom a leaf is white except as white powder to it it does two things one with an animal eats that leads to get that white powder and its throat to kind of goes oh\nIt's terrible it's some water and it prevents that leave from perspiring so it sooner dry climate we got an a native sycamore that grows here\nSo it's fifty percent more reduced a more efficient with water use and it keeps the animals off sycamore great animal resist a plant\nIt's got this barked at peels and flake so that the animals can't get to it can be an layer as easy some plants are like that of course it turned out if you walk through neighborhood and you've got tremendous heavily into problems or rabbits are everywhere or deer roam the streets at night\nIf you got that walk huge walk to see what your neighbors have\nThe animals are just going to your yard there in every yard they're roaming around Goliath Joe let's go over here let's see what new over here as well eat their yard and so you get to looking around and you'll see that the Alberta spruce there in every yard\nAnimals don't like it they don't eat that she put Alberta screws filter Mahoney or or or Oregon grape or in every yard\nSo you can find one in your yard and having no pressure from the same heard there's roaming around their yard will roam around your yard so you don't have you can plant with confidence that you're going to be okay with that\nI have used society garlic or IRBs sometimes I'll use a lavender Rosemary time oh oregano I'll actually plant that in my containers\nAnd hides the scent of the things they like so\nA ... a ... they they live for Kayla my gosh if you've got Catalina don't even bother with kale they're going to go after it no matter what you do up but some things you can plant you can hide the scent they can't find it with with an herb\nI Love society garlic and so I plant some of those is pretty puts on his garlicky kind of sense to it and the animals to leave things alone in that pot in that container that part of the raised bed using techniques that generally animals don't like herbs of any sorts of Rosemary does so well up here lavender\nIf you're the only way you can kill lavender is if you water it too much they clap she ... otherwise ignore it it just grows and grows beautiful evergreen pretty purple flowers which is a great plant\nA time I've got a timer lawn rolling it's evergreen blooms in the summer here is beautiful the animal my dog's even like the roll around they come into al smelling like time yeah that's great [noise]\nUh so you could use some of those old technique some tricks or use those plants actually a land scape with out in your own yard\nMost of your natives so I well I Can't say that you're prickly pear handling a prickly pear\nOr sometimes ... ah the handling all pull up the Yucca and eat the Rudolph they don't they aren't they don't like to plant they just want the roof is a starch moisture you know kept food source\nAnd so if you see that once they get rooted they're fine but first the animals look at your yard they this is their home\nAnd they know when something is new in the yard it's kinda like where's Waldo only they find the plant to the wall of their look it up over there is something new there it is let's go check it out they tire heard follow me around the check out this one New York oh they just one new fruit tree\nAnd they may or may not like it when you're going to check it out and they'll push and test and dig up and throw the side and see what's they might not even want the plant they just they're going through it to the side I Wonder what's done this whole why were they digging here why they put those plant here what's going on\nAnd so you got to train the day the herd of Halloween our deer or whatever it is now to train them going at no less than guys you've seen it you've done it has been here or leave it alone moved to the neighbor's yard\nWe've have had a you know you use herbs to hide the scent of certain things they like they are now starting to make verbal repellents actually smell like meant or close or\nOf Rosemary that make the oil's use spirits the new plant that they might like with with the heavy scented herb\nAnd it's a repellent and so the animals stopper got here at the garden center and making a ... and they make it in a in a A R T you ready to use liquid you spray the foliage or you spray the ground with a ... around\nAnd it keeps them out it's highly highly effective and again once once they get used to it they just they realize yeah go over there every time I go over there to Teach Like Rosemary I don't like Rosemary I'm going to go over the neighbor's yard and eat their stuff\nThat you want to train them to go over there that over here ... not so good or it's the stuff you really don't like your favorite smorgasbord is over there\nAnd so you can you can train her to go elsewhere in the lead take the pressure off for yourself every once in awhile\nEvery once in awhile\nI I've got a wild land will come and yet not the whole herd I think it's just the big board will come in and run around check things out oh yeah yeah he eats up a few pansies and big things up and then leaves the damage isn't that bad\nAnd that can recovered pretty well right now this is when they come in the pumpkins or right out front is decorations and they love pumpkins it's their favorite bang\nAnd so they'll come in and eat the pumpkins even tell where the Halloween a herd of have been up and down your street just by looking where the pumpkins have been destroyed\nAnd so you want to watch watch that one there's quite a few shrub you can plant could Tony actors or at least just covered some of these um a pirate Canada\nIs actually very very good this is one your grandparents grew but they grew because there was so tough\nIt grew fast as pretty berries
