C. A.\nHannah welcome back to hammer time brought to you by having pike county contracts association if you're wondering or if you just joined us where Sandy is she's down in the valley a tending a meeting with a registrar contractors on behalf of our association\nAlways working seven days a week so uh you're you're straddled with myself in a couple of great gifts this morning so we hope you'll and enjoy the show and stay with us\nSo we were just in the process of meeting Mr marked Terry a man's need a landscaping when we had to take a quick break so mark once you go ahead and then fill us in on the rest of your company\nMorning again my yeah so we started business back in two thousand nine and um we've been steadily growing sense then things have been going really good of course the economy is on enough turn right now and I'm keeping nights and busy\nSo two thousand nine you decided to jump right in there right in the middle of the downturn\nSearch kind of feeling the opportunity that there was there was work to be done and on a smaller scale it was just my self to begin with and I mean we started with just simple irrigation repair and basically doing whatever we could do to keep busy and kind of get things off the ground\nBut you knew that the end was insight and that they are to bench Lee would be an up turn\nYes sir and it it has been it said it's good and it's bad you know I'm of course there's a lot of good work out there but we are having a little bit of a lack of workers\nShooting and we want to get into that because that's certainly a situation is not only plaguing our industry locally but is is a national issue and we can talk about some of the steps that are are association is taking in at the college is taking to try and and uh intercede to help bring new people into the business\nOr the check why don't we go back to the two thousand two thousand four era two thousand six era a when things were just rocking and rolling so to speak\nAnd then all of a sudden we started seeing a downturn so describe if you would to our listeners that difference that you\nSo describe if you would to our listeners that difference that you see between today's market and when we were booming back in the early to thousands\nWell I'm back in the early to thousands um there were quite a few uh contractors in this area um there was lots of activity everybody was busy\nGood morning Prescott ah it's my ... with a hammer time we are filling in for Sandy grocer executive director who is down in Phoenix doing some work for why she ca and at the table this morning I got to gentleman with me ...\nFrom the Carol company and mark the Terry from ... need a landscaping and we're talking about the way the industry is of all being\nThe good the bad the ugly et cetera and a check and I were just talking about some of the things that differences between the early to thousands and now and mark you got in you dove in the middle of the the downturn in two thousand nine\nHow has it been for you as far as your grocery company what have you seen good and bad since you started a business\nSure and and I hate to say but at one point it was a little easier back then because I was able to handle the workload that I had of course had the people because people were more readily available during that downturn\nAnd of course it was easier to purchase equipment and things were on sale let's put it that way there were so many unfortunate people going out of business are changing businesses that\nAgain I thought there was a little opportunity for a small guy to get in there and start something and then of course from their with the turn in the economy we've been able to grow in and things have been good but very challenging from many different standpoint\nThat you started by yourself how many current employees do you have\nWe have Twenty one total employees and the company now\nAnd and author here we're talking about some of the trials and tribulations that we're facing on a daily basis why don't you share with our viewers and experience you had last week as far as trying to gain additional people\nYeah so typically we're actually laying off during the winter time sometimes it all depends on the workload but our workload is stronger right now than it was the middle of summer\nSo we are trying to add about three or four more positions to the company\nAnd it has been very challenging you know we went and all different directions and I actually had in one day five interview set up that uh you know guys called an offer ads\nSet 'em up and not one of them showed up for a while and then there was another one the following day and so it's just been very difficult to get guys interested and you know the career opportunities that we have all across the board and the construction industry\nAnd and that's something else we're talking about a fair as it is a construction industry [noise] pardon me in the construction industry really is a profession and there are a lot of long term professional opportunities for people out there who want to get into the business\nBut uh the business up until the downturn ah I think had an image of well this is just part time work for people and it's really not a a long term opportunity and that's changed that's changed a lot so ... what do you see Chuck\nWell in in in ... let me\nJump in on this one because they think everybody is so focused on sending their kids to college but there's not enough jobs that these kids are you know going into debt for these college degrees to get\nIn order for people all across the industry and we do want to let you guys know out there there's truth her career opportunities whether it's working for somebody long term you do have to start somewhat from the bottom and learn the ropes but I mean you can be management you could be sales\nYou can own your own company which is part of the American dream and I at this we we've got to find a way the industry to get that out there and let these people know what's going to be hard to start is going to be a little physical work but you get past that it it can really be funding and rewarding\nYeah and I and I think the the mindset needs to be realistic that you don't just waltz into a company and started out in upper management writes you do have to as you said learn the ropes and start from the bottom but there's not a whole lot of\nOther blue collar or white collar opportunities when you get out of college within three years you you can be making fifty grand a year right without a hitch\nOr myself I graduated high school merely and um moved into the career field working for a relative that had a construction business\nAnd I'm I'm being in since Nineteen Seventy three and now I I own my own company um we've we've been in business for a long time and for somebody with a a a basic high school education to become a business owner\nThis country is about the only place that there is available for that to happen\nAnd if somebody like myself can make that a career then um other folks can do the same thing and and one of the things that I feel that it's changed I'm\nMy opinion is that the building business is a business and it's a profession I'm construction folks when I was\nA profession I'm construction folks when I was starting out in the construction business basically most folks thought that if he went into the construction business you weren't able to do anything else\nAnd in my case maybe yes maybe no but I've thrived in that business and and um our business is a big big outfits for this area as far as the amount of work that we've tied down\nIn ... I don't think people sometimes realize that for example in the construction part of it and the framing part\nThere's a lot of math to involved in construction and I was just talking with my granddaughter this past weekend and we're talking about the importance of education and the importance of of applying yourself in grade school through high school I Can't stress enough because once you get out\nI mean every day we are using math in our respective businesses\nAs an example um as far as English literature and being able to compose a resume or a proposal all those things come home to roost show going through just the primary grades and paying attention is very very important\nMy grandson hunter was over at the house yesterday um we had an opportunity to go do some target practicing and then he was talking to me about school and in ... I I have trouble with ratios and percentages and\nAnd fractions and I said well okay what do you need to know when I was the worst math student at Denver graduated school but I'm really good at arithmetic has good say was yeah it was and so I was able to show him\nHow to do a figure out a percentage of something in a way that\nIt wasn't maybe textbook perfect but it works every time and it's quick and it's easy and so there's lots of things that you can grade school and high school is the last free education you're ever going to get because once you're out of there you pay for it and one way or the other is in either pay for college\nUh your college education or in my case it came out in my wallet every time I screwed something up I wound up paying for it so\nTake advantage of that education and then and then\nKeep in mind that not every person is geared to be a college student and if you feel like that maybe that's not something for you there are lots of other places for you to go where you can do will and be respected and what you do right\nHand you can get involved in the construction industry ... venturing off in one direction maybe find that you know the engineering aspect really appeals to me and boom you can there's nothing to say that you can't stop go to college and bring that back into the field\nAnd now with all these colleges on line like you said you could almost do it while having a full time job and you know business management alone that's another hard power we're finding in our industry is finding\nManagement and so you know taking those certainly courses and learning about 'cause all business have that same applications when it comes to the office you know we still have billions we haven't really seen\nYou know so there's there's a lot of good that goofy hat\nIn Boise hosted in Bush that helps to get the money at that point the boys who are going to take another quick break and we will be back with you surely [noise]\nGutters are not created because you spend your hard earned money on gutters that may not withstanding Arizona's harsh element called Arizona seamless gotta a trusted name for over Thirty years ago a friend

entities here in town so so kudos to our industry I guess I'm trying to to to earn a little bit because we we do participate\nWell like even you and I held a sponsor that Gulf\nFor the kids this year and if you look at all the little league and the um [noise] I got the YMCA teams and all that and the most of those are all those teams are supported by contractors and businessmen of the area and it's great to see that and see everybody participate\nIt although it's a double edged sword because I Love to support\nIndustries or an ... like that but it's a little demeaning when you go out on the golf course and and you find out that a twelve year old whipping yet\nBut that's okay because I don't get out the golfers route that works for me I\nKnow it's a very good and I do I you know we got a plot all of our fellow businessmen that help because I think the kids are everything I mean it's our future church do we need to keep them interested in interacting in team sports team sports also can apply in any company ...\nAbsolutely if you get all the developing no social skills right and that very much helps you know I wanted to change that focus just a little bit and talk a little bit about the permits\nAre that are going Shani is very good about bringing in statistics and sharing those without ... radio audience as far as what is increasing and basically in all areas whether it's the towns and cities the county\nThey're all incurring incurring an uptick in business\nUm and so while that's a blessing it is a double edged sword as we just talked about because it's a matter of trying to find the manpower in order to accommodate all those needs right\nThe timelines for pulling building permits and this is getting longer and longer and there's lots of reasons for that part of it is the codes are getting so complicated that there are so many things that happened to be dealt with now that did not used to be an issue\nI Know engineers are being required to be involved in projects now more than ever homes that maybe ten years ago could have been built without engineering stamps now you just about the need to have those uh building departments\nAre always like to see the engineer stamp on something because it helps give them a layer of protection\nA the training that's involved in teaching the building inspector in the new codes and and what to watch out for and again building technology is rapidly evolving almost on a daily basis\nYou know used to be the main difference between ... and the designers architects and I'll backtrack for a second\nUh in the state of Arizona you do not have to be an art licensed architect to provide a set of plants however you're not able to what we call stamping your plans of a you have to be a licensed architect in order to stamp your plans\nBut it used to be that architects as you said could pretty well designed home stamp their plans and away we go uh I don't know one architect now the release it I've dealt with in recent years who is in ... the help of a structural engineer\nWe have a commercial projects that we're fixing to start in town here and there was a civil engineer a structural engineer an engineer for this deal building\nThere was an electrical engineer and an architect involved in this project for three thousand square foot addition on a steel building wow that is basically manufacturing and storage\nThe development of that project was such a huge education for myself\nUh in in the layers and layers of inspection and time critical uh\nEverybody took four weeks to do whatever they did and then when you add all those numbers up that a lot of time because there's lots of people involved in that project but it was necessary in order for it to get through the building department\nAnd that's one of the other things that has occurred uh with all the influx of a new regulations et cetera is that the timeline for building is certainly increased\nUm and from a ... consumer's standpoint well they want to get in their House yesterday they need to understand that it's not just because the contractors have contractors aren't trying to get 'em in there a lot of it is dictated by the time it's going to be required for inspection the inspection\nProcess maybe we can touch base a little bit on a perfect will be looking forward to talking about that and just a few minutes we're on the

a once again here's your host say Andy Griffiths\nYour morning and welcome back to hammer time just before we left we are talking a little bit about the permitting\nProcess and how that's changed and the requirements for permits which has just changed and mark was reiterating and I'd like you to share it with our listeners\nThe types of things that he has to get involved in now whereas before ten Fifteen Twenty years ago landscaper no problem they'll come in they'll take care of all your landscaping in Shelby and there'll be out no fuss no mas no permit snow applications done deal all that's changed\nIt's changed a lot you know I started about twenty five years ago and now of course back then I don't think we had to pull a permit for anything you know in a just recently we've got our current project going in Prescott valley where we have a you know ... structure and some barbecues and water features and\nYou know you got some electrical and some gas lines going in there so we've had to go to the town and fall the permits for that and get all are inspections as we go through ... and even like some of the barbecue stuff you know that wasn't even permitting five years ago but now as things are changing you know we're getting a structural stuff involved\n... there's permits across the board almost a technical you're supposed to pull a permit for every irrigation back flow that you do so\nThere's a lot out there that that should be being permitted that may not be\nAnd that's just on my end of it let alone that changes I'm sure you guys have seen in the actual houses and commercial building\nAnd and that's I think that is another thing that I wanted to just quickly address a difference between the license professional contract there are entities and those that are the unlicensed a do it yourself or going to save you some money we won't pull the permit and that's just the same as if you hire to license contractor\nWell that's just not true it's just not true\nAnd if you do not permit these things and you go to sell your house down the road there's going to be serious issues with it and you're either going to have to demo disconnect whatever that on permitted item was it's going to have to go away to really pass inspection that point\nAnd\nWe're the talk of the quad cities and eleven thirty AM Chait you in a brigade rally and on Ninety nine point nine FM Kay Tuesday me I'll get\nThe mountain Gardner is paid for by waters garden center and it's all the responsible for content\nWelcome to the mountain Gardner on Cape Cod name with local garden expert Ken Lay mountain gardening can be challenging ... can ... huge reward now welcome you can blame\nWelcome to this week's edition of the mountain gardener this is your host ... we're talking about the landscapes of northern Arizona and it is beautiful my gosh this is Nick ... says what follows all about this is why\nWe live in northern Arizona it's just been so beautiful you know your thought winter was here and then all of a sudden it's nice again we call the Indian Summers or or you remember back last spring you thought it was warm thought it was warm thought it was warm and then it got cold\nAnd then it won't backup and it was like ... it was like this violent warm and cold warm and cold and and the temperature would swing like forty degrees\nBetween daytime nighttime and and that's why the prostate the last frost date of spring at most of the elevation is going to be that first week in may you higher elevation folks in Flagstaff and paint up lakeside and at a Williams you're you're going to be\nProbably the end of may you folks are lower elevations cottonwood camp Verde Sedona Kingman you're probably down towards the\nEnd of April but basically if you took mothers' day plus or minus a couple of weeks and they decide\nThat lasts for us it seems like in March we could we which we get tricked into wanting to plant too early hours summer blooming things\nAnd so they get zipped the fruit trees get tricked into blooming too early and they get in zip to the fruit just taken\nEspecially if you're if you're planting the wrong variety is for the mountains so if you're planting a desert variety let's go to your big box store a big big cops go ... ... thing and and and they've got these fruit trees out front and they're so tempting 'cause they're like fifty bucks that's a great deal\nAh they're they're wrong variety in many many times they'll grow but don't ever bloom and fruit\nAnd so that that's why timing is ... is is important and then also the variety is important\nRight now we're into the fall blooming things I thought it would cover some of the things that shouldn't be planted right now things are best planted in the fall right now if you see ... all you see a salon Troeh or at your grocery store and they go to here is the take home and then then played it\nIt will not grow outdoors from this point forward it'll you put it out there within a week dead\nThey're made for indoors or in tropical landscapes or or interior landscapes are made for has health plans kitchen seal thinks he I've even struggled growing pains\nSeal things he I've even struggled growing pains all in my window sill because if it touches that cold lasts in January and February it it does not like that if you closer courting down in front of it and it's between the pain and and that's and that curtain it will it gets too cold there it'll just keel over and die\nAnd so they're made to be where it's warm\nRight now you can plant Rosemary you can plant lavender you time oregano salt series chives garlic ... there's a whole series of plant that love to be planted now\nYour best parsley crop will be planted now through\nOh the end of November So your best a lettuce spinach cauliflower brussel sprouts they're all planted now and you're harvesting those for Thanksgiving dinner for Christmas dinner and they'll keep blooming or producing or you can harvest raped through winter\nI Would say if you're into kale healthy you know there's no more antioxidants than there was an kale or beets those are best planted now\nSo that you get to work out four seasons the big mistake many people make when planting\nIs they'll take that last cool season crop in may we've got our last frost is only going to get nothing but warmer we quickly go from seventies beautiful everyone celebrating the spring season two Ninety it's just hot in the mountains\nAnd and those springing blooming things don't like that equally if you go plants right now the summer loving things things that love the heat will the heat's pretty much gone at this point yes it's nice days\nBut there's a chill in the evening it and it comes down to nighttime temperatures for most of these plants and so this is when you do want to plant your cool see them things let's talk flowers you're you're paying these love the cold\nAnd it's one of the biggest mistakes a lot of folks think their thumbs are are are black\nBecause they miss timed or misjudged window plant that crop of\nOf pansies and so it it quickly cope that just falls over dead in the heat it's above eighty five degrees paying these they're not happy and there's no amount of water or shade you can give him work to keep them alive\nThey love to be planted now the only thing that would be better if if your plants in about three weeks we get a light snow right on top of ... thanks giving they would absolutely celebrate that some plants like the cold\nSnap dragons are that way dusty Miller are that way viola as a ornamental kale there's actually edible ... which is very sweet very delicious\nMy bounces watering thinking about like Lisa actually sprinkles ah she makes us too but it's got a with\nFreshly cut up tail that's so good into soup oh it's so good [noise]\nUm and then there's ornamental kale and it's just meant to be pretty and they're typically reds purple and white they're just gorgeous and of course the most famous of all of the fall perennials moms or chrysanthemums\nThey love to be grown they looked to be planted now and they'll keep coming back every year bigger and bigger and bigger to my mom's I printed it was a ... a gallon I forget and now they're they've got to be\nGod it'd be two feet across their glorious they've set to blossom twice they bloom late summer and now they're blooming again so that just really what you want to see out of those principles but it's about the timing sometimes it's not you\nThat has the garden issue sometimes just the nursery you're you're the advice you're getting and the timing you're getting the wrong variety or you're painting the right variety at the wrong time\nAnd it and it doesn't succeed or fail struggles you're wondering oh\nWhy did I Do wrong it wasn't you it was it was you were sold the wrong bill of goods basically so that's why we're so big here at least our garden Centre of of garden information so this is our fifty seven year of being open\nA fifty seven seasons when you fifty seven years we started in Nineteen sixty two is to do the math right pretty sure\nUm that are ... and and our formula has always been be friendly be neighborly and and neighbors we're just we're leaning across the fence we're just sharing the advice that you really worked in our backyard and if you do these things are also worked for you and your back yard and and if you teach someone how to garden\nThey'll get the bill catch that bug and then want to do it more and it they're really good at it they'll start to tell it to their friends now now we've got the next neighbor lean against the fence and sharing it with their with their neighbors and so\n... a very social that way and so it's all about getting that timing right so right now this is a tremendous time to be planting those fall perennials even if they're starting to fade let's say the hostages are out there right now ... says are a great big route basically\nIt's a it's a it's a flashy route\nAnd so this beautiful soft foliage comes up the shades plant in the mountains of Arizona with a very fragrant white flour\nUh they they just sit there and I have been at the beautiful thing right now is they are a true perennial\nThey're green foliage was will start to turn brown kind of a gold color in a little lighter than than Aspen gold none of butter yellow but kind of a bright gold color and as I say this search the triple back and then then start to turn brown or it'll just to hibernate\nWhile it's doing that there's tremendous route wrote that happens underneath that and so hostile tend to be kind of\nWimpy more sunny area if you plan to them now\nThey root out through the end of the year they'll route out again the next in those same routes even farther and so by the time you get to next summer's eighty Ninety degree weather in the mountains at least they are going to be much heartier and if you're in a way to plant those in may where they really haven't\nHad any time to root\nThere there were coming into summer\nAnd they struggle so they get brown temps there's a real advantage to fall painting if you can find the fault perennials\nMoms are that way I Would say for coke me a there's a beautiful like iris looking grass has has fluorescent orange flower it's from summer they've been and blow for two two and a half

put them in different spots in the yard so for me I Do I Do have raised beds maybe a hundred and twenty square feet\nAnd then quite a number of container pots I probably have another forty fifty feet

the whole region\nUh we're we're hitting it right on so it it really looks good right now especially in that six to five thousand foot level\nYou folks in the higher elevations have been yogurt the groom creek soon the\nHighland pines you you've been in there for for probably a couple of weeks already we're just now hitting the stride at the little bit lower elevations and you folks that you know thirty five hundred of five thousand foot level you'll be a couple of weeks after us to just has this pulsating waved to put on your elevation and also\nNoticed your neighborhood much of my neighborhood and the house is it fifty seven hundred feet a there is a very ... so there's probably go from six thousand to probably five hundred foot elevation James routine the highest hill\nA house and the lowest what you'll find is those folks that are on the south facing hills they're warmer\nAnd so the plants are a little slower to turn color\nThose plants those houses are on the north facing north side there are a little bit cooler more shaded and so those trees those shrubs they'll start to pop district attorney color faster sooner\nThat's also an elevation change if you're near a washer dryer wash all that cold air in the evening settles in runs down that dry wash so those plants planned to closer to that low spot in the landscape\nThere there'll be chill they'll turn a colored sooner so you'll see the same plant in the same neighborhood\nTurning it different weeks maybe ... ... seven to ten days difference\nBetween when the first one goes the last one\nAnd so my maple maple ... have been beautiful in our neighborhood they've been in a pool random kind of jealous going to win his mind maple Glen charm color and it just just turn this week is starting to go\nAnd so it's not quite there another week and it will be full glorious read just beautiful so bits of Prescott blaze maple it's just stunning a hammer maple\nHas turned color this week or the other name as flame maple it's kinda like a it's sort of reminds me of a Japanese maples got a small maple leaf\nSmall footprint small format\nTypically comes in a multi stemmed format so a Japanese maples typically coming in single trunk we're the miniature tree farm up to about ten twelve feet\nThis when typically as they shipped multi stem to read to make all the reason that flame maple heartier or better or better choice for the mountains of Arizona\nIs at our elevation the sun is pretty intense\nAnd so it's too intense for most Japanese maples it's just hard for my southern folks to really understand Japanese maple grows and full sun\nIn a in Missouri it does not do that here\nIt needs more protection needs more shade will a flame of maple which kind of has a similar look he loves it just hit the hotter the better I mean planning out full sun surrounded with asphalt is happy happy happy\nAnd so it's and it's just turned a the most intense read\nOf most of the maples minutes like fire engine red had to ferry does to watch it go I mean it is that kind of intense\nAnother one that's all right behind that this kind of a shrub ... gets up about had to hire so six maybe seven feet ... a little bit shorter than a flame maple but burning Bush burning Bush or to you on a bus\nOr as a botanical name but burning Bush it's how we all reference it because it looks like the thing is on fire it's fire red is glowing red\nRight now the stock we got here in the nursery it's got kind of a purple here so it goes from from dark rich green\nPurple hue and then right before right after that it goes right read I mean like\nThe the the cord like a red straw it's that color I mean it's it is bright bright red or it's that color\nAnd it is a very hearty plant for the mountains it's a great time to plant I Would say this is your ideal time to plant because you can see the color you see all hearty it's going to be it's gonna keep rooting out through the fall and then after the after the foliage drops because these are all\nDeciduous plants deciduous means it sheds or leaves and has bright Paul color\nA evergreens are going to be or conifer evergreens so it's kind of some some horticultural definition there get those out of the way up but you want of us has this most interesting bark\nIt it's not like appealing bark it's got these ribs up and down the stems that are striking\nA they're beautiful to just cut off and bring it as a bundle I use them as a decoration on the table for Thanksgiving or Christmas her to bow on 'em around a bit just they're very very unusual that's those are one of the plants when I had to get my\nCertified nursery professional certification or this is pretty intense you got to know all your Latin names be able to identify a plant\nBy its with or without leaves the true what are these the truth deciduous I mean no foliage on this plant burning Bush in this identification that yet ten plans to id you go down you've got to get the Latin name and the botanical name of that and the and the common name it's going okay what\nTechnical name of that and the and the common name it's going okay wow was pretty tricky I got I got 'em right I passed\nI Am certified professional [noise] uh but they threw into those and I'll never forget going I I remember that park this very distinctive once you take a close up look you go you'll never forget\nThe burning Bush is one of those plants to every arch that one for their fall color\nAnd now's the time of your plants as typically there'll be in a two to five gallon size plant\nI should probably cover that to what sizes are best planted end when right now if you're planting in the autumn season now through the end of the year through throughout the new year it's better to plant a little bit larger root ball\nThat way if we do happen to get bitter cold all of a sudden in the ground freezes bigger is better\nMore insulated more roots uh you'll get a larger ... mass for next summer as well\nUh you

[laughter]\nAll right well let's get to the rest of the callers here we have open lines at one triple eight seven six seven forty three forty eight hopefully we won't have any other callers that are dealing with a twenty year problem [laughter] uh let's see what we can help my down in Tucson good morning Mike\nMore narrowly how you doing good always glad to listen to you guys are I've got a question regarding screening we've got to a place we bought down in midtown to summer needs some a window screens\nAnd we were looking at some of these ah security screening that they market um has been how they put compared to like the old brought our window dark right [noise] um are they are they good\nWell the demonstrations I've seen they're pretty good [laughter] they're pretty good men thing I had to say I'd I'd never installed any um\nBut from what I can tell from that from everything I see a ... year ear concern is primarily home security\nYeah okay 'cause I've got to replace some of the screen but anyway we're looking at that and saying well\nWorth putting security screens on\nI don't know what the cost of them are\nI'm not from I'm not familiar with either Mike but the uh the other thing you were considering is just the raw iron frame that goal to they outlawed out of the house will put on why sure like the look of the security screen is a lot better than those\nAnd the realtors will tell you that as well you know that that's one thing that screams\nBad neighborhood of iron bars over now there's a way to do them decorative and make them look nice and uh catch some old world sculpting on the metal but that\nYou know you're you start pricing yourself out of reality pretty quick but those crime guard screen demonstrations and I've seen are pretty darn convincing yeah I that's definitely the route I Would\nI Would go and all you need to do is determined for a few seconds I mean they're not going to sit there and eat and beat beat a well\nUnless you it's an extreme situation where you know they don't like to make noise they don't like to be seen a burglar in and out fashion grab you determine for a few seconds they're gone so\nI think the tip they say that the one\nThe the number one point of entry buy a home invasion or cook is the front door so make sure you got a good secure screen front door over the top of your would solid core door make sure you got good dad both with one inch throw on it\nMake sure the screening of the security screened or has non removal pin hinges in there as well as a good a boat with a one inch throw to it\nAnd Rome he's right I Believe that typically they'll tell you that someone was only going to spend about thirty to forty five seconds trying to get in your home and if they can't in that amount of time chances are they'll move on down the road\nWhat you got to remember is trying search your house up in the crime guard screens or a good way\nThat your house doesn't look appealing it it it does it look easy to break into a\n... they they especially like front doors that are screened from view where the neighbors can't see the front door people down the street canvassing for because of a plant or screen
