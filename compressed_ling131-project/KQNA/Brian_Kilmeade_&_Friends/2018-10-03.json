[noise]\nHey I'm a I'm excited for one cause one goes to battle every day but he doesn't have friendly way are on the five and everywhere else a and alerted\nWay he comes from a deep background in politics in more might as well as race relations what the hell do you have to lose the name of the book on Trump's war civil rights now this is Trump's line why did you use that line title\nBecause I thought it was such a such a provocative line some people say condescending other people say straight truth and then\nTrump said black community in this country might as well live in Afghanistan here I'm paraphrasing but it's that Afghanistan is a direct quote\nThat things are worse in the black community than they are in Afghanistan because of poverty violence in the street you know Chicago Brian people shooting each other not bad schools all the rats are and he said what I what do you have to lose why not why are you voting for Hillary Clinton and not for me right so this was like such a powerful question\nAnd the book is an answer here Mr Trump is what we have to lose but I Would begin by saying this to Mr receptive Mr kill me\nThat he distorted the reality of what it is to be black in America in twenty Eighteen\nAt a time when forty percent of the black population this country's making between thirty five and a hundred thousand dollars twelve percent a hundred to two hundred thousand a clear majority of black America\nIs in the middle class or beyond so either striving people given more obstacles exist historically slavery legal discrimination ongoing bias especially in the public's the private sector\nI Would think boy what a great American story people who at times had had some difficulties been denied equal opportunity but believe in American the American dream\nIs that President Trump prevents black the black community as something for the white community to fear someone got muggy or the twenty percent than living in poverty that defines a whole bunch of\nWhy did President Obama take your stats and painted positive picture\nYes much more in other words and by the way\nI heard what I interpreted from him I recall one speech but that's not what I got it oh I'm\nIn fact President Obama responded so many people responded to this what the hell do you have to lose line including President Obama who said boy\nDonald Trump must have missed a lot of history\nAnd I say that let me tell you something with a lot of passion because I'm sixty four\nTrump Seventy two so we're just as you were about the same age and in my lifetime I mean the first black billionaire seen the first black or German the joint chiefs of staff first black secretary of state first black president I could go on high graduate higher graduation rates from high school and college\nI Want you to hear Jeff Flake and tell me what you think cut Thirteen so I was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks uh the initial defense to judge ... capital\nOther than that to judge ... capital gave ... was something like I told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were a if I felt that I was an justly maligned but then it went on and the interaction with the members\nWere sharp and partisan and that concerns me\n[noise] uh that is it doesn't sound like he's on board yet\n... all I can say is they were coming out drum yeah he was absolutely right Kavanaugh was absolutely right in the sense that this was a coordinated campaign designed by innuendo and false representation to smear the guy's reputation including accusations of game right\nI mean anybody that would not be upset in fact Brian I remember one Michael Dukakis was asking a debate what would you do if somebody murdered his wife or something terrible what would you do and they gave this kind of bland and emotional response he got pilloried for that\nAnd you're the guy that comes out swinging when people are swinging at him and he's getting pilloried for that I think he's a human being\nListen I'm with you and the thing is to if you're somebody in society that's working their way up and then somebody cute it's tough enough when you break Cather you spent the last thirty plus years living is a very laudable life\nOn on and off on the job in off the job and they want to go back to the Nineteen eighties and call you a gang rapist and drunk\nAnd you watch your kids and you see them get upset and you watch your parents and you see a humiliated they are and you wonder what happened in my life\nI was about to get the most prestigious job in America and now I have to worry that my integrity might be last forever I thoroughly get it but the fact that people are talking about this now temperament and they're talking about high school drinking does that also show you they have nothing else\nThey've got nothing else for one thing I think a little bit of a different take on it the people coming after him with their questions were being highly partisan\nAgain using innuendo to attempt to do exactly what you are saying destroy his reputation he could eat or ignored either pretend they weren't bi partisan\nThey weren't using innuendo and miss truce to tarnish him or he could come right back out on um my gosh at some point you just got to call people out for what they're doing I think he was calling them out\nSo to ... you know you're a doctor first you did this political thing at a this is the last ... one of the last phase of your career that's supposed to be given back in your mind\nSo I understand your frustration you talk like a real person or on a regular basis with a God of experience but I Want you to hear what I think is a this just blew it off Jeff Flake for me and I like the guy you know I thought for a while I thought he'd get over the fact he doesn't like the Republican president but he despises them\nAnd then they thought well he got yelled at in the elevator and he was overcome with emotion he didn't want women to think that he was ignoring the allegations of sexual assault so we called for the FBI investigation and Republicans had no choice but we can to why he did it listen\nTo Senator Flake you've announced that you're not running for reelection and I wonder ... who have done this\nIf you were running out of ... and not a chance to\nBecause politics has become too sharp to argue that there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nI thought he was doing what was right now he's talking about currency and value in politics if he was staying on the job like you wore he would never done what he did what does that make you think about what the authenticity here\n[noise] um let's just say that I think them to see if you think something is right you do and it's important you do it no matter what including no matter what the electoral politics period end of story\nAnd that's what you're elected for and every now and you take a vote and you still have to explain it and I may not be able to explain that well but that's what you do and so I'm going to disagree with Senator Flake no for his position that may be the case but also for\nI'm I'm a ... a better way would be it was important is the right thing to do I'm taking the vote and let's see what the consequences are by the way I think John McCain did that on numerous occasions\nI obviously he did that and he got under George Bush's skin and he got under a obviously Donald Trump skin a lot and he also went after President Obama when he thought he was wrong especially on foreign policy so the big thing in Washington now and it probably in New York who knows could happen to me tomorrow\nIs all these protesters disturbing everyday life people trying to do their jobs or spend time with their families or or a loved ones we saw with Ted Cruz last week\nWe saw it with a we saw it with kerosene Nielsen we saw with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and that's just off the top of my head Mitch McConnell at the airport and the member Jeff Flake got harassed right here on friday listen\nI'll tell you how do we\nKnow what happened he didn't say a word or he was he was saying you know she was obviously something horrible happened to her and she would take me out and Jeff Flake bullets into what happened to let everybody here what happened when you got confronted by a protester was\nWhy we're having\nEveryone\n\nOr you can as a person to go ahead and Reverend charges\n\n\nA\nAnd that's what she got a full FBI investigation senator Cathy you actually you worry about being politically correct you actually are actually in ... the issue in the protest her she was not ready for that\nI Am being politically correct Brian because by golly give our country gets to the point where an accusation can destroy somebody which everyone who is there says isn't true I can tell you that everybody in our country is subject to being destroyed and that is a tyranny and we cannot tolerate tyranny\nAnd and do it so did you did you know have you been harassed by protesters I hear they're crawling all over the uh the Capitol building\nUm they're all over the Capitol building um but on the other hand\nA it is time to push back it is time to push back on people to think that uncorroborated accusations are enough to destroy a life lived a above reproach up until these uncorroborated accusations um and if we don't do that prime they're coming after everybody\nA there is no there is no stop as to as to how this weapon works\nYou know that the president brought up the other day in fact he said it last night at the rally cut five\nA very scary time for young men in America when you can be healthy if something that you may not be guilty of very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointment of it the largest [noise] it really does brown you are totally guilty until proven innocent\nWell you are certainly guilty until proven innocent\nAnd Chris Coons said as much the president recognizes do you think we're talking about something even bigger than this\nTotally by the way this is a list to the left or just started going to the they went up to Nikki Haley saying girl is things about Nikki Haley\nUm and so somehow um they're gonna charge beginning ... to rumors as a way to discredit people in the right um and you can't prove a negative sort of course you say how do you just proven negative\nI'm a newly Christians and others know better than that but it doesn't just attack do you do destroyed\nBy two and a cat to give me your prediction it do you have you heard that the FBI report it and will you be one of the senators had read it carefully\nAbsolutely I'm really carefully because I have no doubt it's going to be misrepresented by those on the left and we have to be able to speak protecting the identity of those who testified are thinking that there'll be speaking confidential you got to respect them\nBut nonetheless I if if people on the left are going to be ... misrepresenting than people who are right need to be able to set the record straight\nSo then the procedure would be if it comes in today you have called cloture vote tomorrow and then you could vote on ... tomorrow will be Thursday coach a vote on friday and then you'd actually have a floor vote on Saturday\nTo thirty hours and so whenever that runs out whatever time it's first filed it was filed at ten o'clock at night on friday a Sunday Morning that sort of thing\nAnd we had dinner Cathy or would you talk personally to set or college or Murkowski and make your case\nYou know we are having we're regularly scheduled lunches and there is a group discussion and they fully participate I have great respect for my colleagues and I speak other speak\nBut we speak to a group or not Hector in anybody we're speaking to a group respecting the need for folks to come to a decision and I think the process is working very well\nDo you think will all we should all see that raft the report\nA if you could one let's face it a Kavanaugh's been smeared and as Mitch McConnell says the first one of the obituary

stream\n... dot com welcome back so you started this whole thing with your interviewer Brett Kavanaugh no\nI mean it's a remarkable alright what a week um as a you know I feel I feel like the Brett Kavanaugh that I spoke to um that Monday morning last Monday\nThe Brett Kavanaugh that was on Thursday with kind of simmering loaded beneath the surface he was obviously very upset very stressed out very uh intensely concerned about this entire situation what it was during his family\nBut he's trying to keep a lid on it and I feel like by Thursday he had been advised or maybe it was his own decision to let that led just pop off and that's what we saw in there\nAre obviously a ... but people are saying that he went over the top and they're worried about his temperament now among them is somebody he really has to win over and that is Jeff Flake cut Thirteen\nI was very troubled by the the tone of the remarks or the initial defense to judge ... capital gave ... was something\nLike I told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were if I felt that I was unjustly middle maligned but then it went on the interaction with the members were sharp and partisan and the concerns me\n[noise] so where do you think flake is with that [noise]\nWell I I'm going to say that I think like it's still open minded um\nI'd have to break him about this last night he believes that flake is still open minded um but he was clearly disturbed by judge Kavanaugh as a performance and I and you know he's expecting some pretty clearly tried to walk back a little bit after that it said I was talking about the judge I'm Talking about the whole situation\nI think it's grossly unfair no matter where you stand on this to come after\nHim for his temperament and that hearing if he had gone in there all controlled like he was on Monday morning people would say he has no passion if you were accused ... how could you just sit there and answer the questions like that there's a note satisfying some people on this issue clearly and you know when you look back at what Clarence Thomas said to that Judiciary Committee he was as\nAngry as Brett Kavanaugh what they're different people expressed in different ways but he went after them and slammed to them\nFor their political as agent up his process in no uncertain terms and nobody is saying that judge that Judge Thomas shouldn't have been serving on the court all these years\nUm I I think it's grossly unfair and I also think given his judicial history it's it's very unfair to suggest that because he has personal feelings about what he's been through that he's going to throw all that are out the window as a judge because we've already seen by the past twelve years on the circuit court\nThat he has a very um appropriate judicial temperament so you know I I don't know I don't think that some people would be happy with his response either way\nAre you telling you have a son in college I Do are you telling him right now if he screws up the ... not going to get on the Supreme Court [noise] have you have you know my son's\nAbout this and my daughter as well to be honest it's it's really incredible when I look at my younger son um who is about the age that Brett Kavanaugh what it is when these ah charges I've been leveled against him back then to think that you could be\nSomething from that far back come up after thirty six years of your history and your work life is is sending it really is\nAnd the tour at because we're still debating about what he did on\nBetween thirty four years ago Martha should get around to kill me Joe phone calls\nMentioned to anyone until twenty twelve and that it came out in the therapist discussions and edits and a note so that that's consistent with their story and that she didn't share it with him in the late nineties\nYeah so that is uh something that popped up and now we also understand to ... to the boyfriend the ex boyfriends that extra grind\nThe doctor for it helped a friend of ours prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr ... went in detail what to expect out probably grants work then help clean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nWhen asked did you did have you ever take one or prepare for divorce because she\nHadn't yeah ... I mean that if that if his story is true that is potential for lying under oath I it was interesting question when it came up when the prosecutor asked that question did you ever health anywhere for parents that she was she called me from here and now it appears that perhaps they had you know some of that testimony that led to that question I thought that was very interesting\nSo with this next story is fascinating because I've been out of you who feels like he's on a roll with Stormy Daniels which is an odd thing to say a field like I got another client and this guy's going to blow everything up yeah she did a her credibility she goes out there and says well\nOh her credibility she goes out there and says well he was a good Brett Kavanaugh was by the punch bowl Denise by getting though we\nStill don't know it was standing there at though hanging solo cups or not standing there hadn't eaten girls drinks who came to the party to go to a party I Would have to\n... good years even confirm these beer and she's a college person and then she stood outside a doorway when there was group sex going on and he might have been somebody who\nHas a reminder of image she's got so many ... and she was asked you know why are we at this party when you're in college and they were in high school and she said oh there were people of all ages there from like Eighteen Fifteen to like twenty five I think she said you know and then I I mean it's just so her story has so many holes in it\nIt's incredible I I Can't figure out how and then he said oh can you know some of your friends who are with you there verify that you were there and NBC called all four of the friends they couldn't get one of them to verify her story\nOr ... ... was on he said that I think the upper ... should be confirmed but he wanted to see the FBI investigation first Kavanaugh's streaks she speaks he says I think they're I think he's in a you know so you should be confirmed but I don't want to see the FBI investigation\nAnd I would start you know you know where it's coming from the time which what Nick that's the third accuser furtherance of why ...\nI think the FBI to investigate every single one of her claims and if it turns out if it turns out that she made it up out of whole cloth that she never met Kavanaugh that she was several years older than that she along with others or by herself\nSimply made up a story the FBI should conclude that she should be tried for perjury and she should be sent to prison this becomes a very important education moment and because we have to teach the women of the world and the men of the world that there is no genetically linked\nAspect of telling the truth\nI think that he makes an excellent point and I think this is what we all need to get back to the idea that all women should be believed is a false\nPremise we need to strip away gender some questions of truth it doesn't matter who's the man and who is a woman in these stories what matters is who's telling the truth and you know there's a lot that we still need to discover there's a ton of these stories out there\nBut if you strip that a way you are at least on the right course to figuring out where the truth lies yeah and I think\nThose who are at a now when Donald Trump junior was asked the question are you more worried for your son or your daughter about that it's in the future he says no doubt for my son's here's what Donald Trump senior said coloring\nThere's just a time when your father\nOne your husband or your brother and when you saw\nA terrible thing just a person was never meant that I did things that will horrible\nAnd they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do\nThem sad situation to run\nAnd who do you worry about more your your daughter or your\nYou know what I worry about them equally when it comes to this and I would say that one of the big lessons for young women\nFrom this whole thing is as hard as it is if something happens to you you need to document it right away you need to tell people what happened you need to tell your parents you need to tell the police you need to have whatever evidence you can possibly grow up in that situation to prove\nBeyond a reasonable doubt that what you say happened to you that is my message for young women and I think it's a very important for young men they need to be extraordinarily careful because we're living in a time and that's me too moment where the pendulum has swung too far\nAnd where an accusation becomes an indictment and that is not the judicial system that we live in in this country\nDirectly a and by the way the other thing I Want to go to to return W okay be another as you wanted to bring up a few Theresa Martha mckell and so you're getting said first show at seven o'clock you want to talk with the protesters\nYeah I'm not going to do with them is like with the women have accused him like the protests are in the um elevator\nJust because she wants to come out there and scream everyone thinks oh my gosh something bad happened to her how do we know that I feel like\nI Believe in the liberals when they said they will do what ever it takes to keep a Trump appointee off the bench\nWhat makes you think that these women are the type of people that could do that because we saw that on TV we saw all the women wearing them Johnny when you saw\nWhat they were doing and we heard what they were saying I mean there was a woman\nI Can't remember what ... was she was only TV talking about very gross things go on with women's bodies every month and it's almost like they were wanting to blame all men I just don't get it right that come out and they say that this happened to me we don't know that\nAll right they retire I Would say the either yawn that we don't know whether or not you know the women elevator went through this experience is I'm going to assume they did I I think they probably did\nUm but their experience does not translate to this situation these crimes are individual crime they are not a broad brush that used to all men with each one of them it needs to be determined on its validity and so\nDo you know Jeff Flake and Brett Kavanaugh and Dr Christine afford\nTheir situation that they're all determining the truth is completely separate from every other one of\nThe situation I was real cat to do when he was confronted yesterday listen\nMore for\nEveryone\n\nOr you can as a person to go to a non criminal charges on a\n\nMore\nWhich is\nI hadn't heard that exchange that's really remarkable\nAnd it's a it's a very evident of what's going on and it's not you know I I ... in a very interesting also that the the president tapping into about you know your son and her husband because that that's a very bold strategy the president never shies away from saying that he something that he thinks it's tapping into what a lot of people are feeling in the country\nBut I Do think that men are the majority of which are good and and don't spend their time assaulting are attacking women feel under siege I and we're actually going to a men's pound tonight we did a women spend all the other night uh for moms\nAnd we had people on both sides of the fence who felt that you know Kavanaugh was was guilty and and other women who said that you know that they didn't feel like the charges have been proven

I've been to Minnesota show many times I Love the state I live in the state of confusion all you understand California where I live I don't understand Minnesota\nMinnesotans are known for niceness than they vote for a mean party [laughter]\nRight right we we uh when a stones are really really nice people and they like they like balance and they like people that treat others with respect and we are we are a strain state where we've we cross valid vote we don't vote we don't stay in our lane we\nWe cross over to Democrat Republican and we like to vote for big names here we've had Jesse Ventura as governor a\nLive Al Franken as US Senator so at and and\nI even in the same year they voted the most conservative US Senator ride grounds at the same time they go to the most liberal a senator and Paul Wellstone so we do we we vote on some some different things are different from from all of those across the country that I I I think I feel even worse for you in California and done it\nSo you should [laughter] you I mean you have you ever real chance now your opponent is campaigning with Keith Ellison she's almost ... is a is is this far left as we have in American politics\nAnd she fell asleep and of course has serious charges against them with regard to abuse of a woman\nAnd I'm not saying they're true I'm not saying they're not true but they're they're they're not from high school they're not one incident\nPunish all the playoffs\nI'm white I'm and I'm running actually for the hash tag ... to Al Franken sea\nSo there is a lot of responsibility in this seat and who represent Minnesota in the United States Senate and\nAnd to treat everybody equally when there is a charge of sexual harassment sexual abuse domestic abuse and\nThat Tina Smith my opponent is showing the complete hypocrisy of herself and the Democrats because the Democrats are interested in speaking out on sexual assault or harassed and when it comes to their own party and Tina Smith\nIs campaigning around the state with Keith Ellison and she had said because Keith categorically denied these accusations\nThen Keith Ellison therefore is innocent yet when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and the ... uh unsubstantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh\nUh see any war under oath that he didn't do it um she's calling for a full FBI in investigation and she also said that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to being innocent before proven guilty it's now all of a sudden the the proof is on those that are accused and that's it that's the sad wrote that the Democrats have gone down and it's going to discourage a lot of people from running for office and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat is that it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are showing right now\nOkay so that's a double standard issue what about the issue I have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans\nWho or anti terminal on on the grounds of sexual shall not forgetting they're against them because they would be

and the eighth district up on the iron range which has all historically always voted Democrat we're going to have a Republican congressmen up there down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat

now but it will get them back ... hopefully [noise] she was a typical response to HIS Video for ... you know Prager you comes out with a video every week a five minute video [noise] pays a serious thinker it daily wire\nWhere he is very popular part test\nSo a lot of comments say things like I Can't believe I watched this video it made me sick\nBut they don't tell in in the vast majority of cases they don't explain why it made them sick\nIt's a it's in your seat for\nIt's a it's in your seat for people on the left that's enough\nBecause its feelings based so it made them sick that easy definition only sufficient to invalidate the video\nSo we have Andrew back\nUh I think um I don't know what I think he won for vodka tonic or something I'm not quite sure are but we got your back Andrew\nI'm not hearing Andrew so quick [laughter]\nWe'll we'll hear him in a moment I suspect he hears me and is now in ... in a bit of frustration are you there now\nI hear it can you hear me\nYes I

yeah now I get it yeah you only have Seventy two million subscribers there and [laughter]\nSo uh here is a typical comment I Can't believe I watched this video it made me sick they don't tell why made them sick and I was saying well we were getting you back for most people on the left\n... being made sick is sufficient one does not have to explain why one is how many sick\nYes that's it is absolutely right the ... you know this is the thing I mean we're watching this obviously unfold Cavanaugh\nA debate is this how powerful you move to energy this idea that if you start screening if you start weeping and you know bad but something must be wrong and that's just not true which is actually true\nAnd it's it's a very strange reaction to take too because it raises again this question I I disagree with you I'm not sick why why to my ideas make you sick but yours don't make me sick and just it just you know if it's self points to the fact that something must be wrong\nWell and and as I said it's it's so feeling space to but I really would like to know what what me again I Want to interview these people I mean in my listeners knowing serious\nThey're all anonymous but if somebody said and and I'm contacted bowl [laughter] at the following email address I think we would contact them\nI I remember when I wrote a piece a moral my columns years ago saying\nIt's titled when I went out when a wife or when a woman is not in the mood suggesting that if you love your husband\nYou might on occasion not let mood alone determine whether you have relations with him\nBecause it's so important to most husbands and it's such a loving thing to do so the Daily Kos a ... attack me for advocating marital rape and I don't know and the Huffington Post did let this this past week they did it on the scene column from ten years ago\nPrager who was advocated marital rape\nThe these does yeah come on\nIt's lined up uses you can hear it in interviews again and again what you're saying is\nSo you say you know I'm opposed to feminism I think it's oppressive and they said well what you're saying is women can't work you know what I'm saying you say that it would be loving you know to to uh have stuck with your husband even if you're not entirely in the mood what you're saying it was meant to be able to ...\nYou just think well wait how did what machines\nWith what I say go through where it came out for an awful and it's because they have that assumption that a binary assumption that there's their opinion and it was great I mean I think there is thinking they argue the most absurd things for for a million years people say oh there are men and women\nI mean one day that becomes hateful it doesn't become it's not like somebody says to you know there are some then kind of very feminine traits and they feel uncomfortable with their bodies and you say Hi you know I I I can understand that could happen\nWhich they say well some women have conditions get over it or you know how can you have that debate how can you have this conversation", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "year": "2018", "city": "Prescott Valley", "day": "03"}
