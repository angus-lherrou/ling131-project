what's ah what's happening is finally people were getting to know me I mean the states a big state multiple\nMedia markets and I've been able to get out there and let people know that you have a business guy somebody who's been created Fifteen hundred jobs unemployed three thousand people were twenty ears who ran for Congress has a Chevy dealership has taken away from them\nOr somebody like a brown who really\nWhen he graduated from college and ran for office in an office or forty four years is only worried about one job and that's his\nUh and it's interesting because that message resonates the\nProblem is a ... you you might not notice I jumped in little trays\nJust seven months ago when the individual who was running against Sharon the last couple of years have to step down for family reasons are that a seven month a opportunity is trying to get people to know man it's happening people are finally getting to know who I Am\nRight congressman and a couple of things if you I was just amazed that the senators from states that are a battleground states never vote a with the president I mean short brown ... never vote for the president but yet the ...\nPresident I mean short brown ... never vote for the president but yet the people of Ohio already voted for the president at the very least it's purple right\n[noise] well absolutely and ensure brown has voted with the president but it's a long president he was over ... bomb almost a hundred percent of the time he has been voting against this president because some against is president approximate eighty five percent of the time and that's the other thing I've tried to let\nPeople from Ohio no he's a fourth most liberal center and the country ... outlook Ohio's a purple state timing read it's not a liberal state he votes Ninety four percent of the time of war and he probably would be better representing Massachusetts or California than alarm\nRight and I think that's a lot Claire McCaskill's trying to market yourself to the middle you have um you have a cinema also trying to prove that she's trying to shows he's a moderate I tell you what the country would be much better off if the if if these if leadership had to earn your votes in the Senate they're all these people who are sending so fair and balanced\nHave not shown to be fair and balanced what kind of senator would you be\nWell look I've shown that uh Brian when I went to the house the first thing I was disgusted look was all the backbiting between Republicans and Democrats and I literally\nOn the first month started a bipartisan breakfast at seven years later is still going forward so from joked about her every day in our debates and all anybody comes to practice but you know we have almost thirty members hurricane Republicans Democrats that talk about things we can work on together uh and I've said this time and time again\nOur problems are not Republican problems are problems are not Democrat problems are American problems the problem that I've learned the violence in being and being in business and then going into the house of representatives says it's politics gets in a way of everything and that's why we're so divided when we should be at least looking at ways we can get things\nDone right or that would be key maybe maybe it's going to come and vote to try to get things done after a while a congressman what do you plan to do the clothes I Know governor Kate tickets finally backing you\n[noise] yeah the the real issue here is just getting people to know me I mean we've spent seven months of getting around the state are trying to get as much media attention I chuckle because uh I'm as the president calls her ... news and much of the mainstream media\nHas been very vocal cord much in a local Ohio media has been very local toward shared because his wife was part of the media for so many years that we've been breaking through that little by little but we're just going to continue to get that message out a business guy somebody who has created Fifteen hundred jobs versus somebody who's\nBeen in politics for his entire life and we're going to continue to work a travel state I'm In and get them get their message out that's the key when people get to know may may come my way\nAnd it's just been such a big state that I realized even in our last poll we only have about fifty five percent name id ... brown has a Ninety two percent name id that's the difference we got to make up that difference or make sure people know who I Am\nIs exploring devastated right now so let's let's look at it as a couple of issues out there and the plate or on your on we Congress going to have to take a look at the ... this guy is that can afford a working he's going to announce it officially Sunday\nThat he wants to get rid of birthright a ... birthright citizenship you have to illegal immigrants parents were born here you're a citizen Trump things were misinterpreted in the constitution where do you stand\nOr walk I I Am a big believer that Congress needs to be immigration program people in Ohio and people across this country\nAre mad because of too many illegal immigrants share brown actually supports not only no no border uh he he wants to eliminate ice like the rest of the Democrats and when it comes to sanctuary cities he supports swim too\nThat's what people don't like so they start there and then they started looking at an immigration system and saying spoken and then they look to those that are born in Ohio or in this country and say you know wait a minute we're we're land would come across the border or doing everything just to let go immigrants and\nThat's why I say it's just not one issue if the entire issue we need a strong border wall when you to make sure that Congress gets immigration some kind of immigration law passed and um that's what I'm hearing you know in Ohio of course people are mad that anybody can walk in the state I'm but I'm not sure we can override the fourteenth amendment you see I\nI Do believe in the constitution and I'm not so I think we need to support those as well but president bit of help\nBut there's been a big help coming back to Cleveland on Monday next week the vice president in tomorrow to try and push their votes I mean this is about getting the voters out or let's face it we know the Democrats are going to be out we got to make sure the Republicans out and the independents are showing up in a\nLot when it comes to capping off and all these things were just got to get people making sure they're following\nA blessing in play you wouldn't have the vice president President coming gym and they say best of luck [noise] thank you so much for and we come back we will cast and at the end was already a company out fanned out\nThat the amendment states quite clearly that all persons born or naturalized in the United states are citizens of the United states but right in the middle of that line are six words\nRight in the middle of that line are six words that say and subject to the jurisdiction of their of\nAnd it's sort of a weird claws and ever since it was ratified there's been a debate over what it means\nSo for for many people the amendments suggests that we have unlimited birthright citizenship and the country while many including some of the draft or is indicated that they believe\nThat they that the amendment says that you have a birthright citizenship if you're subject to the jurisdiction you're either a citizen or a legal resident but not if you are undocumented or a diplomat or a terrorist\nSo this debate has literally raged for a hundred and fifty years\nNow what the president is doing um it could resolve this by pushing it into the courts\nBecause the Supreme Court really address this in a famous case in Eighteen Ninety eight\nWithout really resolve the ultimate question is a case called long Kim ark and involved Chinese parents who came to the country had a child here and the Supreme Court said that child as a citizen\nBut the problem is that those Chinese parents were legal residence\nSo the case doesn't really answer the question on all of our minds about undocumented person's\nStill what was the president for that case\n[noise] well ...\nYeah the Supreme Court said that reading the fourteenth amendment these people are subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and therefore their child as a citizen [noise]\nUm and most people who adopt a more restrictive view of the fourteenth amendment have no problem with that they have no problem with saying that legal residents can can have their children recognize the citizens [noise]\nThe the issue is what to do with all the rest\nAnd that's a really tough tough question now part of the issue here is the means that by using an executive order or the court may ultimately say look you can't do this alone you can't unilaterally just make this decision [noise]\nNow the funny thing about that is that I'm actually a critic of executive orders cause I think decisions as important as this really should be made by Congress but the funny thing is all roads lead back to those six words\nBecause if the amendment says that anyone born in the United states as a citizen that President Trump clearly cannot change that with an executive order on the other hand the court decides that the amendment has a narrower meaning\nEnsure he can exercise that power the executive order so even though them there there's gonna be the threshold question the court may have to answer the ultimate question\nAnd then and then it'll go up to the highest court and is very conservative view of did any liberal view of this is the liberal view let everybody become a citizen is a conservative you know one\nIt's sort of a mix certainly a lot of liberal professors argue that the amendment is clear it's a constitutional right it can only be changed by the constitution [noise]\nUm I don't see how you can really say that I mean it really terrible thing about all this is and and you know I've talked about this in the past about the lack of civility or how we don't really talk about issues anymore in this country this is a good example there are really good faith arguments on both sides this is not\nSomething where you could say the other side is just entirely ignoring the law the constitution they're strong arguments on both sides we should be able to have this conversation without labeling each other\nAs you know racist or or destroying America and this is a legitimate question people really don't know what those six words mean\nI'm ... I'm looking at this and this so called anchor babies applied to your right\nWell yeah but a lot of people do game the system uh you know we have ah people who have these hotels these maternity hotels where you come in and have the child the United states and then you get that citizenship for the child\nAnd so there's obviously gaming that goes on is that the a serious motivation for immigration yeah probably not I mean most people are coming United States because they want a better life\nBut I sure there are people that game it\nOdd they say between Nineteen eighty two thousand six and a number of birds to unauthorized immigrants would you uh would you opponents of birthright to to go anchor babies sky rocket to a peak of three hundred and Seventy thousand\nThat according to to the Pew Research study and twenty sixteen when slightly down when the great recession hit and now I assume things get better will be attractive once again\nSo the president's going to get people talking that's what that's what's happening today seems like you embrace the challenge how we always felt like this\nUp into what year did we view or do we just always been the case if you were born here or whether your parents were documented or not you're a citizen here\nYou know what Brian this has been a long unresolved question but the irony is that the Democrats\nAre at one time supported the narrower ruling a view of the constitution Harry Reid actually put forward a bill to confine citizenship\nTo citizens and legal residence eyes so that actually gets to a third possibility and interpreting the constitution there is a third interpretation which is that by saying that it's if you're subject to the jurisdiction\nThat frame or as may have just wanted to leave this to Congress the Congress can change the jurisdiction can change the definition of citizenship\nUnder that interpretation President Trump still could not use an executive order so of the three interpretations only one of them would allow him to use the executive order and that's the one that says no they always intended to be just for citizens and legal residents\nAnd it's hard to imagine a day when the midterms are over since it's so anticipated but one day they will be over some say a week from today if everything gets done and then we'll going to be having hearing about the Mueller probe once again here's the president last night when asked by Laura if a shield he'll sit for mowers questions\nI mean it's ridiculous to them to do anything because we knew anything but we will probably do something as well will respond to some ...\nWell that could be written in some ... probably said don't just pick and choose but from where you understand where's this probe at\n[laughter] well you know it's a fascinating question because mowers acceptance of written answers only applied to collusion questions he actually did not\nSay that he wanted answers in writing to obstruction now whether he would do that orally or he's insisting that must be oral is anyone's guess I still don't believe that there is a prosecutor bull or credible case of obstruction\nI I you know what he has we can only guess at a bite if the president does sit down to answer questions I think that Mohler would move fairly quickly to get this report out and it would go to Rosenstein and the assumption has been that Congress would get a copy\nAnd the assumption has been that Congress would get a copy but that's entirely up to the deputy attorney general he could not give Congress\nAnd if he's still have the job after the election\n[laughter] yes all these things are up in the air or the good thing is that you know the the reign of political commentator as well and in legal commentators will once again come to the\nFore which is all that Jonathan Turley a which after your career it's so so typical of the ego [laughter] know typical so John and a couple\nOf things that I interviewed Papadopoulos twice once on radio for a half hour and ten minutes on Fox and friends which is like four hours in human time so\nThat you know how should those interviews or and basically he figuring out there in some way shape or form he was targeted and miss it worked for British Intelligence who was the one who initially talked to him and said he had Russian contacts and he didn't\nAnd that Christie ... were linked through the world cup investigation because he worked for the world cup committee and now they have the ambassador down or might have intelligence links with uh Austria Australia he will not answer the question Mr there's now disappeared\nAnd now the insurance policy tax back and forth\nCoincides with the arrival of Peter Struck a good friend Peter's trucks to arrive in Britain one day before he was question there's a lot of things coming together around ... to now looks like due to overturn a his his plea deal\nSo what do you think's going on here I mean it's getting harder and harder to follow but for you and I who have been following it close it looks really diabolical\nIt's a mess I'm I I think it'd be surprising if he could overturn the plea deal first of all he got a very light sentence the judge is not going to feel particularly motivated or because he went into it as an adult with open eyes are now he says some things weren't as close to him but usually courts say you know what it\nIs a buyer beware you know you take the deal if you face the wheel so I I have a tough time of that with regard to all of this late stuff you know I'm most interested in people

setting up tents a lot of logistics Jennifer all unwind it for us um but let's get to that\nNow with um thing is things do you need to lower our three Brian's numbers\nHouse is going to be it's going to be tight a history is against that but there are things that are working for us to one of those is a president who is out on a daily basis or working his tail off to help Republicans in tough races\nCongressman John Ratcliffe is talking about the house it's not over yet and he really says it's because of the president one week from today the experts way into the president picks up his

somewhere in the sense in the process it will happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about\nYeah wow wow the actual is with the big story and the big revelation President Trump plans to give an executive order that would remove the birthright citizenship for babies of non citizens born on us soil plus there is now a plan for the caravan which I just mentioned\nBefore we go any further and bringing my first guess let me just tell you you are the places here the nations that have repealed birthright citizenship Ireland in two thousand five India in Nineteen eighty seven Australian to thousands to have a New Zealand new two thousand five\nFrance in Nineteen Ninety three so that does not some crazy a theory by countries that are don't understand our culture\nA step guy

I'm not going to I I Would rather matchup ego let's be honest\nBut that's you know here or there yeah listen I'm I'm sure Iran to along the way\nYou know what I mean somewhere along the way I definitely ran into where exactly it gives you a well hey I Can't I forgot I forgot I forgot to mention my bottom line is this love the show love Fox and friends may do a great job my point is is the best shows you exactly what the Democrats are all about\nBecause God Forbid somebody on the right like a ... is a this is what he would have shown that when he or Trump or something like that they would they crucified shows everybody and I don't know why they don't play clips\nOf the of the other side when they do stuff like this and just show the like like I mean the way they ran a Joe Biden put what they are hearing all you've got to do stuff like that because everybody knows Trump wasn't the greatest guy before he got ran for president we all know that was the bottom line is is\nYou know public areas that hated and couldn't stand Obama treated him of thousand times better than they're treating Trump and Hillary Clinton thing right in this Cory Booker they looked as best shows you exactly why that opportunity and how bad the Democrats really off because you won't you know one\nWord about it and I just want to say one other thing I Will never watch Saturday Night live again because of the Trump thing but also because in a way to display knew it was your voice the way they may and June show and I know you'll go with it\nBut I never watched that junk again they don't show much better than a man and just ... out and listen ... with a Trump fan is that we need to vote Republican because you and there's people in All right Brian\nAnd these people in All right Brian go get him Frank good listen W okay be in Jacksonville hey Glenn\nI just wanted to call you and ask your question uh I really enjoy your program ... and and I appreciate all that you done one of the country are trying to get the truth out there well I don't understand is why you're a President Trump would start out what mall or\nWyoming or a you know hasn't even try to make us look like a parent investigation as far as our cars are because I hadn't asked the Hillary camp thing or are they didn't break into her a officer or take all her lawyer stuff I mean that'd be some interesting reading don't you think\nI think so yeah that would be some interesting reading Glenn to keep in mind this is just really kind of plowing that feels just testing the waters them Bloomberg threw it out there that then the president said you know my my answer some questions but it's totally illegitimate so I don't\nThink anything searching but he read the last couple of chapters in the Woodward book I did you get a real tone of what mother was after from John Dowd John Dowd regrets cooperating they were they going to work on it together and get this thing over with and find out what the Russians did mixing it becomes clear that that more as a gender for Trump\nAnd he's trying to set up a big perjury so find out something use misstated or Mr remembered\nAnd get them on that it's a big perjury trap ready to a radio happened here he is last night on this I'm forty one\nShould have never been a special counsel in my opinion it's an illegal investigation totally a lot of people agree with me a lot of people on your show in another shows agree that there was no collusion was never any collusion it shouldn't have ever happened but with all of that being said I Do get along\nI Am made everything available you know why because I have nothing to do with Russia\n[laughter] uh and that's how he feels he says I make everything available he did but if you don't remember who you talk to and twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen\nAnd they will you know look at Mike Flynn look bad but apple it's a little kid to look at the uh the other people that got caught up in that Rick Gates\nBut nothing to do with throwing in election by the way now Julian Assange might be\nExported from London where to hold up in the Ecuadorian embassy they'll look at the going to get rid of him soon might be coming right over here and maybe he's going to a talk and maybe exonerate or implicate the president but we'll credibility to the F\nWhich is a problem here is more on the president on the other question cut forty two\nI mean it's ridiculous for them to do anything because we didn't do anything but we will probably do something else will will respond to some\n... I don't know can you do that\nIs it the further you get Fifteen question do you respond to eight\nThen everyone's going to focus on why he didn't answer those eight I don't I don't know how you do some of the questions but Democrats a theory is if Democrats get the house they will begin to pressure mother to either step aside or cook conclude this thing because they want to do their own investigation\nAnd so far it's been handled smaller lid Malone he's a professional we've got no agenda is a Republican appointed by a Republican or retain by a Democrat leave him alone\nWell now Democrats will change\nTheir tune because they're going to want to run a lot of these investigations because uh they're ... they want to a PIN number Republicans damn follow up on the peanut butter Devin Nunes just want to know part of that's why so much is at stake especially in ... county and in a state\nOf California where there's still a lot of red areas that they want a foot below what it takes for all eight seven six six nine our troops headed to the border what would they do Jennifer Griffin will tell us next\n\nI think that's exactly true this is designed to get maximum publicity to be broadcast down into Central America and to deter people from making that dangerous thousand miles plus journey paying a paying those uh those people who are preying on their misery charging\nThem seven thousand dollars a person to make that journey those are what the\nThe coyotes and the people who are involved in human trafficking charged to these poor migrants\nUm and so so yes I Believe a lot of what we're seeing right now is they're using the U.S military as a symbolic deterrent but they are not going to be standing guarding the border per se and I it's just important to keep an understanding of what they're allowed to do and what they're not\nYeah I understand but I also do we there's all this money for defense and you know I was hollowed out you do that special about how you are how to take apart vehicles in order to be able to get other vehicles of uh especially a strip him out because we're so out of money now we finally get money Defense Department and they were putting it on our border\nWell that's the real concern is that remember when you have a defense budget even when it says largest the Pentagon's budget and you know seven hundred and fifty or so billion dollars that money is all allocated by Congress to very specific programs and\nAllocated by Congress to very specific programs and to reprogram that money in the past when President Bush and President Obama sent a National Guard to the border are typically a D O D Pentagon would be reimbursed by da chess\nThis time I'm told they will not be reimbursed and it will come out of that large defense budget but that's not a slush fund that money has all been allocated so right now the controller here at the Pentagon is scrambling because they're going to be asked by Congress where this money is coming from they don't just keep a budget of I mean this could be\nUp to one point two billion dollars that will be for sending these troops down on temporary assignment\nThe ... when President Bush sent six thousand troops down to the border it cost one point two billion dollars so that money is not just sitting around in the Pentagon budget it has all been allocated and as you mentioned it was supposed to be used\nFor things like reading is improving the planes that were falling out of the sky that we described or being ... in the bone yard\nOr two after Seventeen years of war to to improve the military readiness it was\nA not designated to send us troops to the border so now they're scrambling trying to figure out where to find that money in the in the defense budget\nI guess so and do things are true of defense Mattis had to be convinced to do this\nAnd look I'm not going to speculate on that I certainly know that a Secretary Mattis um had to consult with lawyers and and that's what they do anytime us troops are are sent to anywhere and there have to be a they still have not determined the rules of engagement and exactly how\nA that has not been defined on paper I've read the order that mad assigned on friday\nAnd it is talking about support capabilities that the U.S military can provide to the border patrol but\nIt is a complicated legal dance whenever you send us troops and we have had a law in this country tradition in this country since Eighteen Seventy eight that unless uh that that in that sense us troops are not supposed to be armed on us soil and used in a law enforcement capacity\nI mean we still have we have border patrol we have um a local law enforcement\nUh the it is very hard not to see how this has not time to to coincide\nWith the election next week the reason that they're using active duty troops is that they can deploy a lot faster we're told than the national guard last night the president made some remarks in his interview with Laura Ingraham is getting some attention here at the Pentagon in which he uh was perceived to have a suggested that the national guard were not\nAble to be used in this circumstance and that that suggesting they don't move quickly enough\nOf the reason that you're seeing active duty troops used is because they can deploy quickly but it is an unusual use of them in terms of the traditional role that they've had the Pentagon and hear it on us soil\nWho Jennifer how was been dealing with the mad as Defense Department so compared to others what are the pluses and minuses ... it's\nIt's complicated because certainly the biggest change is that we don't have very many a press briefings anymore we have to\nA ... there are not as many briefings and the briefing room there is a briefing taking place right now that to be fair from Baghdad with the um the public affairs officer um who is stationed out there tell updating us on the ISIS fight so we do get those weekly briefings up but\nHe used to be that every few weeks we would have uh the defense secretary and the chairman of the joint chiefs seated side by side taking our questions from the professional Pentagon press corps which is about you know twenty to thirty people who are here every day in the briefing room that doesn't happen anymore the last time that the\nPentagon I think if I remember correctly that last time that the Pentagon had a press conference and the briefing room with a spokesman or an official from the Pentagon was in may so that's quite some time and so that's a real change from the past um and you know what can I say that that is a change\nYou got it uh Jennifer thanks so much interesting times thank you Jennifer Griffin from a Washington we come back from your phone calls the metro take one now John loosened W and I guess in Norfolk, Virginia hey John\nFace or a good show as usual show breaches\nOh okay well we're talking about the border and it's like ... to say I think Trump will do well president would do well if he would call an emergency session of this because I think it it really is I don't think it's going to be taken lightly and I don't mind him sending the troops\nAs long as he was doing something to try and put a stop to it and turn around and send a message\nOr like for him to do all I think he couldn't history and promote the White House live on the networks whoever wants to show up and he needs to ask every senator point or all camera in mulling what they would like to do about this\nAnd have their expressions I mean I don't believe any ... you don't let them go over and keep ... answer the question and if they refuse to show up make sure that it's all camera to and let the American voter see what they are voting for\nBecause unless there's enough I mean\nIt's it's horrible I I got a you know I got compassion for people to but after a while a welcome that does nothing but a doormat you get a brand new home he got a welcome that people walk over to a few years now it's a doormat that's maybe that's what will become\nYou know maybe John good point I Love your analogies we'll be back in a moment with your

call out\nThe uh the moral fraud the lie about blaming President Trump for what happened in Pittsburgh it is one of the most disgusting lives of my lifetime\nThe left has great competition on which is the greatest lies America's a racist country is one of the great laws of the left they lie constantly you don't you don't realize it because they all lie and therefore you don't realize that July because you have to hear somebody say its ally\nIf people say that green is yellow and green and yellow with all you hear the news\nDavid Greene as yellow within green and yellow with all you hear that is green as yellow most people believe green as yellow is inevitable that is the way it works so if you if you have if you only listen to the mainstream media you will think green is yellow\nThe mayor of Pittsburgh will meet because he's a Democrat and that that's what it's about\nThe morality none of none of the left stuff has to do with morality if if the left cared about morality would have been anti communist greatest put your of humanity in the history of the world they were the left wasn't a wasn't anti communist was anti anti communist\nThat's how I learned about the morality of the left when I saw the way they treated other people when I was at Columbia in the name of humanity disgusting treatment the professors and other students and so on I that I learned this very early in life\nI was a liberal most of my life I'm Still liberal in the classic sense but it's irrelevant because we only have liberal so that conservatives and I'm Alan Dershowitz [laughter] or maybe they move into\nWhat I Wonder though I think I think they ... uh you know they showed last night twelve hundred people at Colorado State University in broadcasting from Colorado right now\nAnd uh they they showed a preview video right before I spoke to the twelve hundred mostly students they were built there to\nTo want to be very precise and they showed them why I left the left by day Ruben Ruben is a is a gay liberal and that of video for us yeah we homophobic pretty university a gay guy\nWith a few we happy few gay guys giving videos truth is truth whatever the source\nScreech can line gays can tell the truth that means that about like not obvious that shouldn't even have to say it the less can't tell the truth if uh soon as you start telling the truth you leave the left\nI Believe that with every fiber of my body is not possible to be committed to the truth can be a leftist because he would be spending most of your time condemning your fellow left is relying\nDonald Trump caused the Pittsburgh massacre\nAt it it it's just astonishing if you'd open in the Atlantic is an article by a Jew and I'm a Jew just in case you didn't know staff writer for the Atlantic\nFranklin for if we are\nAny strategy for answering the security of American jewelry should involve shutting Trump's Jewish and neighbors their money should be refused their presence and synagogues not welcome they're placed their community in danger is this man's sick he is sick in his soul he's a moron he's a food\nI Am but I Am a Jewish Trump enabler for do you not want me in your synagogue you would not allow you to give money to build a ... to build a a what you wish nursing home disgusting thing you oh my God\nI vote Jewish leftist not Jewish liberals are left is the fourth or Jewish this is another proof of it there on the left the left is the greatest source of of Israel hatred on earth and they shut their ...\nTheir worthless in the battle for Israel worthless that's the big Jewish issue today\n\nLike that that may or may easing isn't it in in the Atlantic they published this crap that affects you supports Trump you a Jewish group should not take their money or allow them in the synagogue it's mind boggling mind boggling gets away with it because the the Atlantic select we can get a ... journal\nFranklin's for F. O. E.
