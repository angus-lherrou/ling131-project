Leesburg, Florida hey mark\nHow ya doing good where do you think about all these who have nine separate packages now what do you think the overall aim is it's got to be from the same people\nSure um first of all you can leave your shirt on and you got to make a statement gets a little gods Caesar Robert Graham shirt oh really okay yeah\nI'm I think it's a group of people I think it's multiple people that are doing this um I don't think it's just one person I think they want to make an impact they didn't go after the Democrats and they didn't go out and you argue both of them\nBecause they wanted to make an impact so they just went up to the Democrats debate you know get Trump a hard time I think it's um it's a group of them not just one mob mentality work in a group like they did with Kavanaugh ethic that's what the problem is and I think you're going to find it that one it's a bunch of all\nWho it is the you know mark they got to balance you know that there's somebody putting it together like we can't even imagine like no show a show runner has ever put together\nAny type of drama on TV they're putting something together I think maybe even within our show we're going to begin to get some clues on this because you're delivering nine shepherd packages in five different dates to all these different locations somebody slipped up\nOr they all went to one place and found out I mean we can track it that way they're even tracking where the envelopes were made let alone the labels who may let alone with the ... bought they could do all of that thanks so much more of an interesting theory one eight six six eight seven six to nine FBI's run hospital next\nCould have detonated by accident if after right activities if they're right actions were taken on it\nI mean we know a couple of things we we if it is true and it's a dummy\nKnow a couple of things we we if it is true and it's a dummy divide we wouldn't be able to detonate I Wonder what we can learn from it and how much danger postal workers were in UPS drivers were in\nAnybody within how far did he get now we know it wasn't going to get close to the Clintons house we got to George towards his mailbox we got to Brock Obama's didn't get to his house but got to his location where his mails distributed or John Brennan was actually send to CNN even though he doesn't work there\nAnd they spelled his name Ron Eric Holder Maxine Waters that too and they're yeah Robert De Niro and Joe Biden and didn't get to actually to their house and I'm Wondering where are those with those people who were handling it if it was a legitimate bomb as it turns out not to be were they in danger and do we have to amend the system again\n[laughter] yeah I think that uh will again remains to be seen if the devices or actually did have a running timer attached to some sort of power source of battery a battery device within the timer\nA clock mechanism is there a power source there that that could have actually triggered these devices good question secondarily if if certain mishandling of balancing the devices around machines sorting the devices\nWere of a sufficient to but you know potentially trigger that can cause a an injury or death or or maybe somebody\nLook if if black powder in it and in a one inch PVC pipe with glass it sorted all that PVC is potential shrapnel as well ah the glass as potential shrapnel could you kill somebody could you blind them could you maimed somebody ... you know cause them to lose a hand an arm\nUm because of the the amount of black powder that's all in my mind a possibility this is a dangerous device even if it couldn't have been triggered by the clock because the the person didn't have the technical skill right to uh to detonate this it's still a very dangerous to\nIran I just want to get your mind taking into it around to see what other conclusions you get to do we pulled marry an old tool ah she's a profile where she was on CBS this morning this is what she would similar conclusions go on\nI Would be looking at the forensic and our results and all sorts of behavior it's a combination of the terrorist how for example the FBI lab will be looking at the functionality of I ... I'm ... not working or are they not exploding because that's the problem I'm\nKind of a case if they are intentionally designed not to explode but to create fear and panic um than we can possibly expect to see an escalation and cents another batch of bottom that come out\nOn this subject to me that someone that really planned this out quite well so we should not assume that mistake that we've seen in a\nPoster of Pakistan's are let's say for me to think on purpose ... there's also an arrogance hopping I'm hopping on it and\nThen for someone who um it's creating a great deal of fear and panic and New York and in that area and he's enjoying life aren't there that have power and control and I'm an African fat even getting out of\nReally being the center of attention now throughout the country and it's probably like a narcotic for him so they can play a part in housing ...\nOr how the series of attacks my factory involved wow the word of bombs is that your fear was that you worry\nThat that is a concern some of these folks who are building devices a very often are testing them beforehand I think we saw that with the the Chelsea bomb\nI'm worried that the guy had been created some other devices with testing them near his house a bad happens with some of these guys and so how does he evolved from this does he is he fearful because of this big law enforcement response right you have\nFBI Secret Service New York police department post ... postal inspectors um US Capitol police all engaged in this so far and other law enforcement as well um the does that make him fearful and say holy crap I'm going to get caught and he pulls back\nOr does it empower him and hasn't Mary Ellen was saying does it in Boulder him is that the rush he's looking for and say look look at that that the power that I hold you see sometimes this with our ...\nWho are ... they they are they start a fire and they pulled back to watch the response that excites them [noise]\nSo what kind of a fender do we have you know the next few days may tell us that\nYeah my lines are jammed I Want to let the people talk for a while but before we go can you let me know what it's like in New York New York has got the sense that they can do things themselves and maybe they earned that right\nNow we have a very uh steamed counterintelligence operation at the same time the FBI comes in and they want to run things are they ... the joint terrorism task force or they clashing do you know how they're doing right now\nYeah I think we we have some good leadership up there I Know a bill Sweeney ... the assistant director charged a friend of mine\nUpright apartment I just saw him uh about ten days ago down down in Orlando runs counter terrorism for the FBI the J.

he's someone read the so you know there was a time in which we you know we hit the guy\nI don't really think that that gets you nine a package bombs\nSeries a pipe bomb strikingly similar targets prominent dams and CNN [noise]\nWhat do they have in common they all spend their waking hours critical of the president who they blame for the mail bombs the president is that fair\nI mean think about this Ninety two percent of all coverage in negative if you look at other channels they have a panel sometimes of eight or ten and seven dislike the president\nSome of which you hadn't ... popping out of their next with their ... their hate for him don't you think that has a lot to do with the fact that there might be some anxious in the country it's not just coming from the president\nYou just don't like the fact that he is president like his tone in tenure or you don't care I think he is legitimate which is pretty much the story from the start\nThat will be is wrong I Believe they're blaming Bernie Sanders for the Bernie Sanders worker they shot and almost killed the the grease grease on the baseball field there'll be like blaming Brock Obama for sending the tenure to South Carolina shooting took place or take place or the Sandy Hook shooting takes place where the Gabby Giffords shooting to take place\nI don't think the president's responsible for that\nBut what I Love to see a reset between the media and the president after the midterms yeah before that I'm not too sure to work after the first one didn't but maybe the president after getting his feet as we need them for the last two years\nAfter getting the mother investigation over a they lasted two years if that is over and he emerges unscathed which I expect him to maybe he's going to take that time and who would not say yes the New York times Chuck Todd\nGeorge Stephanopoulos come to the White House three of you know two or three of the time excuse me the White House who are Trump Tower one day\nAnd you'd say look I'm going to come to New York like to see you guys and then he go to Washington to me with some different reporters and then you have off the record conversations where people get the air out the main problem with them\nI don't think anybody could say he's not accessible now I Know is one on one interviews he gives more to Fox but boxers what more fair to him and then the other channels so I don't think they necessarily good or bad I think they're more fair\nSo and I know we've got a lot of lying to you what I'm going to do is go on America's Newsroom shortly at which time we'll talk a little bit about what I'm doing tomorrow night where everyone everyone who join me at St Louis county library\nSo I'm going to be coming in going right to the stage and we see now with mark Cox and we're going to have a great time up you have some tickets there\nAnd you get a book with every ticket and I'll be able to sign them personalize them and it's all about thinking a lot of listeners in St Louis who keep us or one of the top are chosen the entire area then I'm going to do this thing called go to Louisiana\nWith Andrew Jackson America's New Orleans I didn't get a chance to go the first time to Baton Rouge on Saturday and on Sunday I'm going to be an Octavia books at one o'clock flying at about five o'clock back in New York about eight o'clock eight nine o'clock\nAnd they're ready for Monday I'm and money will be on the five Tuesday I'll be on Martha it's going to be a crazy couple of weeks but have not been able to talk a lot about history and uh about the history book for obvious reasons\nUh we got a series of package bombs nine in total now I Can't even say bomb I Would say a would be bombed devices and I say devices because there's not been proven that any of these packages would've blown up it looks like there's powder on the inside shards of glass on the inside on the outside it looks like a bomb\nBut for the most part there is no proof that it'll blow up but it almost the same effect thankfully didn't because a lot of innocent people would have been hurt and a lot of prominent people would have been hurt if it did however but it's not going to hurt the president or the former President Bill Clinton or Barack Obama because they've been screened for George Soros he's smart enough\nTo leave his mailbox outside of the compact so that got him near Fort in Delaware and never got to Joe Biden but two packages were intended in Los Angeles\nIt was intended for Maxine Waters in Washington D. C. in Florida down in Miami southern Florida that's intended older return address his word for Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Washington Eric Holder the former attorney general has been a big critic of the president might be running against him\nHe also ah was targeted so the people that block for all these prominent people would have been hurt\nBut we know it's the same on blow up the same boat we're up on the inside the same printing or they say it's the same printing that's on the label and then the return addresses all Debbie Wasserman Schultz John Brennan name is not spell correctly they also have\nA mocking sticker on it it ... I just wanted to buy a ... at least one has a parity ISIS flag and as a freezing freezing get her done and that is obviously making a fun or get her done years ago the cable guy yeah we're still waiting so the device looks the same\n[noise] uh the New York uh NYPD source says ah there was no they could not have blown up according to the CNN package\nBecause there was no blasting cap there was nothing to ignite it that according to Stephen Gomez distracted nothing blow up shows and it's an amateur thing or they were pro who want to just send the message I got a bomb it got close to you it was intended for you intended to Iraq your world\nSo those are the things that we're going to go over there I just flag on a lot of people saw it and saw Arabic riding on the\nUh so Arabic riding on the battery and I have not seen that any other place on a side note tomorrow we hope to have George Papadopoulos in Studio I had lunch with them on Tuesday he is going to get a chance to testify behind closed doors and talk about the dealing with Mahler what went into it\nAnd how he essentially was set up [noise]\nBoth high profile critics of President Trump want to check with our colleague and friend Bryan kill may Fox's banker author of Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans now out in paperback how you doing Brian and the day do you want to hear a lot of rain here what are people talking about\nWell I tell you what for the most part people are a ... for the package bombs on a side no bill we used to have you here you would stand used to do the show on third hours hurting our relationship but we can still talk in the hall or\nThey should invest were nine and there are now okay so we're kind of locked out\nActually a competitor I Know I I guess so\nBut ah I had lunch by the way with George Papadopoulos on Tuesday he was really looking forward to meeting on Thursday and he's coming in to Fox and friends tomorrow he has a story to tell they could blow the lid off the entire thing and return all it takes out of it but in terms of what my calls are saying\nA lot of concern a lot of pointing out that nothing was detonated and there's a lot of people who feel as though when it's all said and done there's sometimes a plot\nFeel as though when it's all said and done there's sometimes a plot\nOr on the left to make Donald Trump look like the bad guys who we start talking about Donald Trump's rhetoric and not about the caravan\nAnd not about cabinet and not about the economy so we took about twenty five calls already anticipating coming out with you and Sandra and that's just opposed to the people but since I've been on and since you've been on as you know we found out about two new packages\nOf both intended for Joe Biden I have yet to talk to anybody and like you I talked to her on house go who have said that these are our bombs\nBut it just worries me then again if they were the most innocent like postal workers in couriers would've been in the line of fire it reminds me the anthrax situation\nYeah very much so you mentioned Papadopoulos saying he was the number one suspect right originally he was sentenced to fourteen days in jail has served a day at the end he addressed that yet\nOh yeah and what what what does that mean what does that say what is what does that indicated about the investigation\nI think it says everything about the investigation I think it says a lot when we congressman Jordan would Mark Meadows with Devin Nunes has been doing in pursuing within ... been talking about\nTwenty eight year old who's really on ... was targeted possibly by your previous or a previous administration because of his links to Israel he was helping Israel with newly discovered oil and setting it up with Greece they did not like that\nThe word is there might be another Pfizer war and it was on him and she ... yeah and they continue to look at him and any top coverage pops up in Britain right the critical column against David Cameron and next thing you know people start coming up to a meeting to talk to them wanting to have in\nThe rain finds himself in the middle of all those are really looking for that interview tomorrow quickly on your book it's in paperback what more do we learn in Jackson\nIncident since we talked last time Andrew Jackson's two minutes been to file for the first time since his death prior to the civil war he\nIs now on the line of fire would I tried to do is remove Donald Trump who's a fan of Andrew Jackson and see what past presidents thought of him because we do and the thing this war on history so I have a look at what Reagan said Teddy Roosevelt said FDR said with Truman said you know they ran Lincoln said about the impact of Jackson that\nBattlefield Wynwood special that made him those famous man in America it let them to become a two term president why why are we attacking him now why we let them off the twenty why we booting horrible phrase is on his tomb those are the things I attack in the paper back this time\nWe'll check it out thank you Brian I served back to the radio you go you got an air welcome any I Can't wait to address the you know can grab her I\nThank you [noise] by one eight six six eight seven six six nine that's mostly the calls I'm getting I mean I just had to be honest most of the calls believe this whole thing is it set up that maybe ... somebody else's behind it but there's no substance there's no proof\nUntil we find the perpetrator until we find the person who would try to terrorize the nine people\nI can go ahead and say that at some plot either way\nBut I Would hope the one thing that would come out of it is it everyone tone it down it's the leaf bleeding to death on second base on a beach ball field on a friday morning I think it was if that wasn't a wakeup call I Hope this is a wakeup call because you don't want anything that you see personally\nTo be responsible for somebody else's pain let alone injury let alone yeah\nSo that's what's going on when we come back we're going to be joined by Martha ... who used to be on with Bill hammer and together they used to come on my show but life keeps changing Martha went on at night bill got an extra hour and now it's just me any of the listeners which is pretty cool [noise] ... [noise]\n\n\nYou know I mean I think that the issues of sort of you know and we put them in the palace intrigue category at the White House I you know everyone that I've spoken to in the White House is very supportive of secretary of health and\nUm and believe that she's doing a very good job now that you know she always said that she starts at the pleasure of the president at that she felt that there's an enormous a jet\nThat falls under her job title that she's very carrying out on but certainly you know questions along the lines of you know because it's difficult to do your job and if there's kind of corrections that are in place and and yet we'll get her response to that yeah I ...\nThe you know you're also going into it I'm not I know you're going to be able to cover there's more than likely but this Arizona Senate race I find endlessly intriguing more Shelley the fighter pilot on paper I thought we have this seat but I get the primary so brutal she's had trouble getting momentum but now she's got it here she is a with you last night\nTalking about I'm Talking about the border cut forty seven\nHave to do whatever it takes to secure the border and uh it's so frustrating that the Democrats continue to obstruct an issue in the the ...\nIt's so frustrating for Democrats continue to talk on this issue the the care of on it it's gets raising awareness to everybody about what's going on but every single day and you know a little mini caravans are coming and they know where people are showing up\nThey know as soon as they that's set foot in the United states either where the kid or they say the right words they're going to be released\nAnd sixteen thousand five hundred last month just released into the interior of the United states never to shop for their core day this is not working for our country we have to secure the border we have to close the loop holes so that includes a border wall and include more agents includes access rather than technology but also closing a loophole that the cartels and others are taking advantage of right now\nSo she she understands a major issue for hours on end and you're getting now now that you're down there\n[noise] yeah yeah absolutely I mean it is a fascinating race to watch between Christmas and Sally their current Congress members from from Arizona and whoever wins will be the first female senator in the state of Arizona but the demographics in Arizona have\nBeen changing dramatically over the years and it has always been a very interesting\nElectorate to watch um you know Jeff Flake seat Jeff Flake is you know an individual who had differences with the\nPresident um it was pretty clear that he wasn't going to get reelected for that seat is up there on my work very weak at the time I'm like yeah that's the thing that ... race and a lot of it may sort of focus on some of the suburban issues um with regard to the present with regard to a you know how people feel about\nHim in some of those districts so it's it's a fascinating to watch I I think she's pulled away a little bit I think the real clear politics advertised that only about a point now aren't right now so the next few weeks are going to be here in\nThe ... right now the other story that I'm sure you're going to be covering even though you're gonna be up close and personal on the border is what's going on with these nine packages yeah everybody we talk to on the on off think we're getting closer to finding the person because\nThey're they're so there's so many opportunities between the surveillance and the packages in the similarities to to putting the pieces of the puzzle together um it's so hard to know where this is going this is this is somebody like I've never seen before\nIt's fascinating and don't forget a one of the many responsibilities that\nAll the energy HSBC under secretary health and its protection of national leaders and counterterrorism I said this is also a you know right\nIn her wheel house in doubt it's even more top of mind that the caravan of Islamic given what's happened over the last twenty four hours to well certainly beginning reaction and try to get some new information from her and how that investigation's going\nBut absolutely there's there's absolutely a lot of signatures and a lot of\nFootage and video that exist of of whoever it is it doing it and I think everybody believes it that the FBI is going to do a great job or going to find this person said\nMore than when you go to the border do you know it to where\nIt's hot I Know that and that's the\nProblem that I Would have I mean that whole thing of knowing what to wear on your show that would be that would bother me because I Can't you can't just put a suit on like where do you do\nKnow I Know you have to address from wherever your reporting by it as you well know sell you know I remember that time you went to the border and had that big park on\nThe way that was a mistake right 'cause I Know your producer Brian tell you know help when it comes to wardrobe because he just wears this every day\n[laughter] you know that that is department okay alright\nListen I'm going to be watching

and to see what is happening\nSo it is clear that there are these people were being organized that's that was your key point they're overwhelmingly amen and as one could see in any of these pictures\nThe should not some spontaneous uprising of of an impoverished presidents show the sixty four thousand dollar question Sarah is do you have a sense of who the organizers are\nA couple or a combination of of circumstances that lead to the event to this massive migration highly organized\nThat to this massive migration highly organized migration of first the you know speaking with with a president morale is and it's the only gives intelligence officials as well as hunter and official\nThe leftist leaning groups in Central America particularly in Honduras\nFormer presidents ally of were involved in this according to their intelligent than what they've been able to gather so people connected to left his socialist organizations inside Central America really began to mobilize these groups in Honduras um weeks ago\nAnd in fact a week before that they were hearing rumors that something was happening that they believe there was going to be some kind of mobilization but they weren't certain\nAnd another thing that I found very interesting was that there were some according to the people that I spoke with now remember I still have to investigate that there were people within the United states people that belong to and she knows her State Department official that we're very close to a leftist leaning groups\nThat were also somehow on the outskirts involved in this according to people that I've spoken with\nYou know some of the groups that NGOs that work out and they're supplying food and water a passing out aid to the migrants on the buses that costs a lot of money nobody's going up people for free\nThat some of these NGOs were involved in it and that may have come for a U.S dollars so us eight or something of that nature I'm at so there was not only does collective organization\nUh based on Central American left leadership you know it's not only harm the government the more conservative on during government and more conservative what a mall and government not only to placate that and create some harm there but also to time it with the U.S elections on and to create\nA okay so I'm All right I I got older I got a lot of questions here joined I happen to know

event and then was kidnapped and maybe it was it was remarkable what time and a number in history so my first question is\nWhat ... what does the left in a in Latin America half the game with this caravan\nMay be more and I want to be more precise may be the miscalculated it seems to me and I think to a fair number of Democrats who she's only helping the Republicans\nAbsolutely and I think there was a greatness calculation um you know especially if they were trying to affect\nUs election or U.S policy and for example with ally in Honduras and and you get a great explanation of that history with ... it's basically an ongoing war with the current government and it's basically this continuous battle with the current government\nBut the destabilizing Central America or not she stabilizes our ability it draws risk in our relationship and we saw that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship\nBut when you have this flow of migration\nComing across their border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand that\nBut Central America allows people to flow freely from Honduras Nicaragua back and forth you know to various areas in Central America on it so they can't really just close the border down if people have their paperwork\nSo what the
