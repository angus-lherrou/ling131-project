America we were transferred to Saudi Arabia after the U.S manufacturing jobs started drying up in the Nineteen eighties\nManufacturing jobs started drying up in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd uh we lived in multiple countries\nAnd we found that uh\nThere were people within the government is not a monolith but but the people and the government like the king and his son the crown prince wanted to reform habeas and get rid of terrorism and they've been working on this turkey nothing like the state want more of this type of islets can move into\nThe Europe but we found something very very interesting I'm a chemical engineer but also supervise lab techs and a hospital environment\nAnd we found that they were flipping out in our crew in and around a crew from Brian infection and they uh cause things like man I have an impulsive behavior vengeful behavior anger\nAnd they were diseases came off the Silk Road a ... a career in Congo hemorrhagic fever or a plague polio malaria all kinds of things including Venezuela Ecuador ... which causes people act like\nA the people who are running the the movement of ... of of people out of Latin America to our border and the FBI just to prove someone quit the tech these thinks it's still a lot of money to finally find back in the eighties\nBut we can mail tests for these things and check people coming out of the country will help other people outside the country because of the things and it would help move people more to calm conservative values\nYeah I lose in I just don't tell me what do you think is a is a doable inappropriate sanction to keep the relationship alive but at the same time you have another brush back but you can't treat a American or any other journalists like this\nYou might need to be severely prosecuted but a a present to the world that we really don't want people killed in embassies et cetera that should have but he should have been talking back to Saudi Arabia and tried if if he was really a part of the Muslim Brotherhood and uh with uh in fighting terrorism worldwide\nAnd and so the Saudis have a problem because they have a hobby it's there and then they have people want reform and we have a similar type problem over here so Congress and the president and the government of a Saudi Arabian need to work it out\nYeah but you were you are for for a guy that lived in Saudi Arabia as crazy as that society is in incomprehensible a as it is in terms of mores uh and the way they structure things you do see the merit in keeping relations with Saudi Arabia\nAbsolutely they're keeping the middle east calm as saving a huge amount of money and preventing so many people from being murdered by the radicals they are not angels but you have to work with them and and we need to move them more and more moderate stance and there are people who want to do that over there\nAll right thanks I appreciate George Mike ... news Ninety six five minute window Hey Mike\nYeah the governor's race might give me your perspective to Santa's bart's Gillum why is Gillum in front of almost every poll\nI think is in French because there's always been this perception that most Republicans don't show up until the day of and I think that that just really has a he got a good guy behind him I think the chopping block it works I mentioned earlier in speaking in the green room\nI think that what's really going to help to just take this election overkill I mean the fact that we do have a very important Senate race with Bill Nelson versus Rick Scott Rick Scott's very well liked by the Republican Party or any other year dealing with probably have a shot I Know the college towns here in in Florida are very excited they are going to come out in droves\nI think the fact that it is a Senate race is going to the benefit of this\nGuy thanks so much great perspective markets way down and talked about that um or\nHow the final flop is going to go to like plant Texas hold them yeah it's getting a lot more it is getting murkier about what's going to happen in that final calculation I think we're going to have a truly interesting election night\nUh you know the words you think it's going to be extended I think Chris right because you think of so many of these races going to be a compelling out on the west coast I don't want to stay up all night but you do think you're going to end up doing that well we\nWe stay up all night on the decision best no matter what it's just whether we have company we like it if you guys stay up and watch a show because there's going to be a lot of interesting stuff you know control the house we have a we have a model that lets us predict which party is going to control the house based on the uh our our polling\nBut also the early returns\nA in a you know if it's a democratic wave will be able to tell you at nine o'clock uh yep here they come in they're there and goes uh but if if this is what it what the current surveys indicate we're going to have to wait for Texas we're gonna have to wait for all kinds of stuff to come in before we have real Clare\nGillis interesting uh I mean as usual Florida I find the most intriguing and the headliners the governors in the senators number one I'm pure performance I Know Scott doesn't have the great or\nThe great charisma we know that but after eight years Florida news ... knows these productive hardworking and honest and and the other side Bill Nelson\nAnd honest and and the other side Bill Nelson who's been there for a while has not been necessarily productivity thinking he's ever going to be vulnerable it'll be over after a two term governor decided to run against him dead heat and the last poll I saw from Quinnipiac\nHas a Scott down I think seven points system like yeah so where you have them down consistently seven I had a we actually were three and then this was big\nSo surveys so he actually is an improved one point in going to be a ... one of our a plus poll that has a good track record that uses the right methodology and yet Scott had consistently trail and this is also what you see ... Andrew Gillum in the governor's race in Florida\nThat should not be the Florida hasn't had a democratic governor\nStands Nineteen Ninety eight I Believe when Jeb Bush won\nA now they don't win by a lot Florida tend to have ... narrowly contested elections I think Rick Scott one by one point and one and a half points where his margins of victory as governor but been so Florida has been a state that has the swing state but that has had a consistent narrow Republican advantage\nUm the fact that rounded fantasy struggling as much as he has to try to get some traction and get some advantage there talk about what kind of year it is in Florida what there is basically what we have we have the volume turned up on both sides to the max\nWe're looking at a year and so normally in a in a by any election in the mid term election the last midterm election and twenty four team with the lowest turnout any since Nineteen forty two\nWe are on track now to have\nA mid term election turnout over fifty percent which you have to go back forty or forty years or more to find that kind of turnout you have to go back to basically the the the internal political struggle over Vietnam to find mid term election turnout like that and if that's true so here's the danger for Republicans\nThey uh the the intensity is back up on the Republican side to match Democrats but the Democrats aren't a bathing in swing states like Florida in swing states like Ohio if Democrats are storming the poll if if Democrats are voting like Republican Republicans are going to lose out on a bunch of seats because there are more Democrats than there are Republicans in America\nIsn't it great for the country and the guy loves politics to get that type of turnout\n[noise] um I Wish we were doing it in a west wretched way um I Wish that it was not so vitriolic apocalyptic an awful but yes uh speaking selfishly on dopey or this is this is this is what I'm here I Am ... as a kid at say a here for this\n[noise] uh he's ... he's always here for the pick up his book every man and king and helps make sense of Donald Trump's rise and let you know this is a not an anomaly there were other similar situations even for men that are that have emerged they didn't win\nCritz thanks so much that could All right let's see when we come back I'm going to have a chance to play Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans ...
