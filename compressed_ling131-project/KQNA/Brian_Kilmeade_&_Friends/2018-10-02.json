Joe is with the Los Angeles Hey Joe we've got some brand new stations out there what's on your mind\nWell some great stuff just I mean this this trade agreement as revolution it's going to kill the media's might have been talking about two things one the Chinese can no longer import cars into Canada quarter bolt on it and say that's a Canadian car\nNo cars have to be Seventy five percent in North America and that's it one that's going to all of those American workers to know the ... how could we played a living wage sixteen dollars\nOn those cards forty four percent of the products have to be made on ... people have to clean up the words of sixteen dollars ...\nAnywhere in the Americas anywhere in North America to know this was almost like a ... from burning ... those are some quick with American hooked up to the living wage for the last question for them so you Mexico\nNow why hasn't the media wasn't really do you think this is a big labor coming out and praising Donald Trump\nWho you know why her hip hop obviously cares more about the Mexicans than the previous government set up\nI Know you've got the first deal with Mexico it shows you that biased but people don't want to emphasize that they show the wallet nothing to do with Hispanics that's everything to do with a secure border north is better off in the south it's not Hispanics\nOr we don't want to keep its panics out we just want to keep a legal out because we have a legal process you and I get that because we're saying\nOther people just want to marginalizing vilify but Donald Trump ... balance that's when we started looking at this I Can't imagine a Democrat fighting this because do you know that in Mexico he basically fortified Mexican workers unions\nDo you know that he is going to help every drug ... lower middle class person get to middle class status because the wages go up now we might pay a little extra for cars but the average American be willing to do that knowing that we're bringing some control back\nTo auto manufacturing and some plants back here when we made it close but what about the dairy farmers to put this president in office\nThey now are getting access to the Canadian market and not having the ridiculous tariffs and the only thing that Canadians got that I could tell and it sounds like you know more detailed than I Do\nIs it fits edits the outside court to do to solve trade disputed still it's still a factor that Canadians wanted that we didn't we gave in there But Justin Trudeau gave in at the eleventh hour\nSo those people who say the president's just fighting with the world are not noticing that the world is coming to agreement and with the president said yesterday about\nJustin Trudeau is true you know he was tough negotiator uh we were going at it for a while but there's no hard feelings so here's what the president saying about uh Justin Trudeau and the NAFTA thing because I should give it a I should give it a proper us dead um\nHe's a professional I'm a professional we had very strong tensions if it was just an unfair deal whether it was Mexico or Canada and now it's a fair deal for everybody it's much different deal to brand new deal it's not NAFTA re done it's a brand new deal I just spoke with them we have a great relationship over to work as a partner\nAnd I was keeping the steel and aluminum tariffs then I'm not sure why we're doing that when I asked a when I asked a painter Navarro why you're leaving that end he says it's apples and oranges I don't get it I thought we did that to bring them to the table so about this the only so much for the call Peter Morici was on Fox in print sources morning around four Fifteen that quickly or emailed\nA Eric to see if we could pull this off to the bigger message to bigger message beyond North America cut forty\nTo enter the Europeans said and this was important that you know the Mexicans agreeing was one thing but I don't think we're going to roll over like the Mexicans because you know you got a lot of leverage their\nWhich is really squarely in the European camp got a free trade agreements with Europe in Britain won't have the clear message to China\nAnd Europe that this president is serious about not putting America above all other countries or really America First but by putting America on an equal footing and giving American workers\nA fair chance at competing in the world\nYeah and so is a mess because we are dealing with them on on some level by the way this just in march judge good friend of Brett Kavanaugh when he was in high school has had an interview yesterday it wasn't done it's finished\nSo mark judge would definitely be on the on the hit list you have a new woman friend of a doctor for ... she's on the hit list Dr Ford might be I'm not sure they have hours of testimony with her and might not be necessary\nA stage with might ah with the one we saw yesterday I don't think she should be I think she's an absolute travesty of justice and if I'm a Democrat\nI tell them look at Michael ... and his client you muddy the waters on the farcical claims from Brett Kavanaugh and you try it almost de legitimize is the other two the Debbie Ramirez Yale student and that's why\nAlan Dershowitz at one of the FBI investigation and I would have started with Julie not with Dr Ford\nAnd now you know why because it's such a joke or Steve listening in Indiana Hey Steve\nHow're you doing great will tell you mine\nWell I listen to your diatribe regarding the soccer kid that his mom is now suing because he didn't make JV was thrown out and I yeah I'm listening to the on the radio so I didn't see what was going on\nBut I just wanted to point out I agree with you a hundred percent unless I find out you through life through I I'm Sorry I I'm leaving on your own\nHey Steve I might have done worse in ... in high school I think I might have done something I Would regret in high school and college do you think anyone listening right now has done things in high school and college they regret\nI can be perfectly honest with you that I Walk the fence mostly through high school and college and I was fortunate enough to fall on the good side I turned out to be a pretty good guy a but I'll tell you I had some close calls\nYeah and a lot of people that say no no I'm not as if people say well what about sexual okay it's an accusation\nThat Brett Kavanaugh vehemently denies and he has a thirty year plus professional record which is the envy of almost every professional who is often the justice system on any level legal system on any level that I Know what\nSo you have to get him by going back to Nineteen eighty five while acknowledging from Nineteen eighty five to print and which is a lotta years nothing went wrong so she was assaulted at a party that she doesn't remember where she\nOh it'd at a party that she doesn't remember where she was how she got there how she left and who invited her\nAnd he doesn't remember her and mark judge doesn't recall any of this and her best friend doesn't remember anything why should we ruin somebody's life because Debbie were mirrors drank so much as a freshman\nShe blacked out and has claims that did that a judge Kavanaugh now did something exposing himself to her and now she has ten witnesses to it even though at the New Yorker magazine\nRuining fatter oh couldn't find these ten witnesses the New York times couldn't find any witnesses now you got ten [noise]\nIt's amazing what could happen if the whole Democratic Party comes out in force for you

he a the days that uh OJ Simpson didn't kill his wife right exactly you're right I think I think I mean I think you know ... and ... what about all the times he didn't try to kill her ... why does he get credit for that if the glove doesn't fit you must acquit right\nDo it as long as there's nobody in her life did know show well the thing she might be up to something\nI'm willing to believe Julie

don't believe her nobody knows better I mean nobody knows for the minute I mean I'm I'm you know he can say that the ones but the fact that I Know and that's what I came here to tell the truth I mean I Know how she is\nYeah okay uh is you have any more to say Richard ... thirty four\nYou know she was always wanted to be the center of attention on the show it was a way to do something major show us when to press knew where everything was he was telling me that she was joining everything anybody knows Julie on the person I mean I Know because they were\nOn to everything that came out of her mouth was just the size of rations and but she never mentioned that to me out or something like the I was surprised to hear these are actually where there is a price brush with senior making these decisions because you have never ever mentioned that to me at all\n[laughter] I go I have an oddity autistic with district to porn stars this is this is going to hurt him he was not been hurt by the trauma day they'll thing at all it actually catapulted you think\nYou think it will hurt him I mean I Hope it does but I I I mean I think we're in a post fact post evidence world where there's not a single Democrat out there I\nThink lawmakers going to say that Jewish stage which made a lot of sense what are you kidding me for today just he moved out of her name he talked to around ... refer to it you couldn't even though the neighbors somebody had to put it put it in his ear buddy she mentioned Chuck Schumer\nUnbelievable he's Charlie her guy\nIs the chances went up that Brett Kavanaugh would be the cute and the Trump would have to pick Amy Coney Barrett or ... or another of the twenty four\nAh judges who are on his short list\nNot a very short list uh so the chances of that happening went up but what also went up where the chances that Kavanaugh would be confirmed with fifty five or fifty six votes with a bipartisan vote\nAnd that went up because if the FBI comes back and says look we looked into everything here we can't find cooperation to prove or disprove this yes and they and and that's what they get if if we get back to\nA there is no evidence there is no way to corroborate that story in any way then we're back to the chance that Kevin gets a bunch of democratic goes I looked at a poll out of North Dakota that was yesterday\nA Heidi Heitkamp to the poll said two things uh Heidi Heitkamp is not going to be a U.S senator for a lot longer but it also said that um the issue this is a galvanizing focusing issue\nFor a Republican and independent voters in red states\nWatching this happen has put a Joe Manchin has put Claire McCaskill has put Joe Donnelly in a very difficult positions [noise] interesting\nDonnelly in a very difficult positions\n[noise] interesting because Joe Donnelly came out right before Jeff Flake to reverse course said not voting for him\nSo he took a bit of a political risk now now they're back and play that well but I might change my mind it might change his mind what Critz but Chris you should know this I I always think I can and guys like Chris Coons to be sober and in ... but Chris Coons was a no before it turns out\nBrett Kavanaugh drank in high school he was yeah that would change his mind now that he yelled at him\nKnow that uh if flake so here's the thing about good well\nUm if people are ... are preferred belief about politics and our preferred believe about Washington and our preferred beliefs about the Senate\nIs it has been informed by a deep deep cynicism and I mean rank but Chris Coons is a guy who he got through ... he he was worried about having a primary challenge this year but he represent the state that's very moderate\nDelaware is as a strong preference for moderation ... no no extremists uh prosper in Delaware politics and I I Would say this\nIs Jeff Flake extend the good will to Chris Coons to say you know what you're right and by the way\n... and play for right if the Republicans would have tried to jam through a and start a votes of falling off the side as you get down to decision time Murkowski Collins or maybe others say I can't do it that's\nA real catastrophe I'm also a catastrophe for Republicans would have been grinding it through with all the doubt filling the grinding it through with Mike Pence cat thing the deciding vote\nThis was a good this was a good compromise for the Republican what somebody like Coons wants to do is generate good will show you go from a no vote to uh maybe vote to potentially really a yes vote if the FBI investigation comes back and their background check and they say now we got nothing\n[noise] uh you know what I think you're right in and Jeff Flake if he is or if he is a conservative he might not be but I think he is a conservative who doesn't like Donald Trump which happens to people like George Will and others I get it\nIf he even as a conservative Brett Kavanaugh hits it hits it out of the park if you're like George Bush and John McCain Brett Kavanaugh hits out of the park if you like Lindsey Graham all off it goes against his party\nBrett Kavanaugh is not Donald Trump junior so don't worry about it so if he if he legitimately just wants to make sure he didn't insult the woman in high school and then I think capital is fine but listen to a Newt Gingrich\nA concluded and he knows how to make deals\nWith this Neal that comes to my current scandal nothing\nI mean Republicans sometimes I miss the passion for being stupid thing got nothing out of comes from nothing so comes planes in his name for early bipartisan let me see how Henry people often young Republicans only I Would you please you have now for a little bit because I feel so much better when you take advantage of\nPeople there's a reason people hit up with a stuff\nRandomly that on a while ago\nIs the most affecting ... told the truth and I think we in American people stand up and say they don't want a country that is dominated by these kind of people and I think it's a really serious threat\nThought that was new to that that's what I said I didn't see that you know and and I think Scott Kelly is great but I just wanted one question he if he turned out to pass this FBI background report over the next seven days would you vote for him would your colleagues vote for him because the answer is no\nThat's the honest answer Blumenthal not changing his mind nice sized changing your mind you know my ...\nBut can I call can I call a little malarkey call here so and um when\nUh people in and people in both parties do this and they say if only everyone would just do what I say then we will win if if only everyone would simply follow what their follow the the instructions and do what they're supposed to do then we will just went well guess what\nThat's not the system that's not how that goes yes obviously if the Republican there are fifty four I told you we talked before about the fifty for for this was really surprising to me um and it tells you something about our politics fifty four percent of Republicans said even if Brett Kavanaugh tried to rape or girl when he was in high school\nThat he should still be confirmed to the Supreme Court because of the argument here is nothing matters anymore just winning just smashing them in the mouth now the overwhelming majority of Americans say no no no no no we have three hundred and twenty five million people we don't need a guy who tried to rape of girl and high school or on the Supreme Court there are other options at hand\nAnd but the fact that we're at a point here\nWhere both sides embrace this concept of right or wrong just do it for your team and smashed the other guy in the mouth is ridiculous because that's not in Lisa Murkowski's interest that's not in Jeff Flake centrist that's not in Susan Collins interests nor Joe mansions nor Dean Heller nor a bunch of members\nSo one of the fiction that frequently get sold to members of both parties is that the answer here is that everybody just quit thinking lashed themselves together and go ... like a wrecking ball and the other side whatever the issue that's not how the Senate supposed to work\nBut I Want you to hear a I Want you to hear what we heard yesterday let's listen\nSenator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder cooking who have done this\nIf you were running you know I Know not attract and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to argue that there's no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nEvery bit of moral fiber a more you know I Want to say well he acted morally wrong with his conscience he couldn't do it anymore he said well you know the fact that I'm retiring is allowed me to take on my party if it wasn't I Would never do it I I'm I was\nThrown out of my mouth isn't that bad I Would I Would only do the right thing\nBecause I'm retiring yeah and that and that is ... maybe he didn't mean it that way maybe he meant it differently somehow but the take away what it really sounds like as\nA man who admits that he would have been craven otherwise and that is not a good look that is anyway and it it is depressing clear about the way that our primary system\nHas made our politics so much worse that all of this direct marketing in primaries has left us in a place where people are ... these these craven vessels of ambition or rather than people who are doing the things they think are right right\nAnd that's how I Am describes a Crazy Artist and I I Know that that that sense of the things Brian things brain would never say that but that's\nWhy we're different people Chris but I like to end with something where you are a hundred percent agree with Donald Trump ... percent agree already curious I'm curious yes\nI did live out his drinking does that mean you'll pull him\nI don't think he did and I look here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker I can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my only good traits I don't drink [noise]\nWhatever they're looking for something that I say I never had a glance of alcohol I'd never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I think that might be the world's worst [laughter]\nDo you agree that if he had to drink he would be a mess well I I think one of the the underappreciated under told stories about Donald Trump or is it is the demise of his brother John ah from ah alcoholism and that was a a formative a in in ...\nAnd that was a formative a in a kneeling moment in his life\nAnd I think that you know he was being facetious but I think that yes very obviously his decision at a young age to avoid the fate of his older brother whom he really loved him he really admired a that his decision to never drank\nHe would not be president today if he had done that right because we already know what he was doing in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties I think if you would have added booze yeah true true that a drug missed a mix of you put booze into that he missed the ex I don't think that you end up with I don't think would you end up with a guy who would age Seventy one is out doing what he's\nDoing exactly I think it dry up because he did make a lot of his deals in social settings usually workaholics avoid that and say I you know with the Henry Ford to the world I had no time to drink I always work you know building cars in a you know if any automobiles\nBut he did make a lot of his deals in social settings and had to be part of the club but he never was part of the drugs and alcohol so they may have\nI mean more money for Arizona\nWe're the talk of the

and it's like\nThe first day in seven the Passover\nIt just says you can't do work so I don't do work\nSimple as that tracked you should see my column this week it was a it was explaining the left and its contempt for\nThe middle class bourgeois Judeo Christian values system and that explains their belief that they are very normal moral rules do not government that is why they can shout\nGovernment that is why they can't shout down people at a restaurant conservatives do not because they believe there are rules that govern them\nThat's why they can close bridges because they don't believe rules govern them this is an extremely important thing the smearing of judge Kavanaugh ... an unprecedented unprecedented smear of a good man I I we ... ... in fact Alan\nDershowitz calls it worse than McCarthyism man has been a is a lifelong Democrat because he's a liberal and he does subscribed to the to the moral norms of of the of middle class norms as we call them but the left is not\nThe normal rules of civility do not guide the left\nThey are ... mention and I write that word they are ... ... is the Superman literally over men they are over the rest of us over the deplorable deplorable believe in middle class Judeo Christian values left ... left wing or is do not\nThey are governed by what they feel is necessary to achieve their ends they break eggs to make a left wing omelets and that is what we are seeing a happening anyway I I got on to that because I was explaining\nI Do feel governed by rules so you can yell at you and that's why I've said also often you could yellow conservatives for being hypocrites because they have a standard but you can who who is a yelled at left wing hypocrisy there's no such thing as left wing hypocrisy\nBecause there were no rules that govern them so you can't be a hypocrite if you don't promote\n\n... by the way another another matter in this regard\nMy original column that this ... this charge should have been ignored it was

the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible imprisonment he may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully she could be forced to resign his current traditional position because having\nA quote convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly for these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence\nOr some standard close to that a judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological professional grounds before the sorted accusations were leveled you can go back to his life Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life\nWill never be the same\nJudge Kavanaugh wouldn't have been my candidate of choice for the Supreme Court I Am a liberal Democrat who believes Republicans improperly denied judge Merrick Garland a seat on the high court but this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice\nWell listen to this is about the most fundamental issue a fair and issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\nWhen the innocent people were accused of trying to overthrow the government\nAnd have their lives ruined it based on false accusations won't being denied old semblance semblance of due process or fairness the American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism for a demanding due process by demanding due process and hard evidence\nBut the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote be resolved against the accused nominee we have come a long way since McCarthyism but we now live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism\nWe must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism liberal Democrat Harvard law professor darker than McCarthy as\n\nThe left so it turns out the left opposition to McCarthy was not for for being irresponsible for smearing people who were innocent\nBut simply because he was on the right\nTo left his allowed to do exactly what they oppose what they claim to oppose\n\nThis is a very very bad moments in American Life\n\nDays before your ah your your vote they bring up a high school charge days before\nI said it should've been ignored and they
