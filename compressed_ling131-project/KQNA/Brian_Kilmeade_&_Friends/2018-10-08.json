she went on to say there's no corroborating evidence good she read everything and talk to every body including the people that she said well witnesses they don't know of it so what do you want her to

did he says didn't happen thirty five years ago and nobody else said happened except her\nThat would make her happy for one reason not for Dr Ford for one reason the seat stays open and they have a shot to win the Senate that I Hope people can see through Keith was a new study ...\nGood morning Brian Ramona which are in Iran yep\nEight I Would love to see President Trump started in ... so to\nThe rank and file Democrats that are hard working historically you know moderate Democrat that or not or just this let's crazy thing going right now he's sort of making a Democrat versus Republican and ... and his policies actually benefit a lot of these people get your your traditional\nManufacturing union workers wages have gone up\nAnd and he's got he's got to separate them from the small minority of these crazy and I know that's not true you know I used to be a Democrat I have friends that are Democrats [noise] this is not who you are in and we were going to isolate these ... he's crazy\nThat to him you know a key that is genius I have not heard anybody bring that up instead of Republicans ... Democrats Republicans work with Democrats or the Democrats are today versus what they used to be and make them think about what they're doing as compared to what they used to do more good than W. H. I. O. N. dating mark real quick\n[noise] uh yeah I think the uh seventh eighth amendment needs to be repealed but the fact that the states no longer point the legislate those senators as it turned us into a partisan circus\nI Know we used to do that we used to just decide who should go and represent the state now people vote on it but I don't think that's going to happen or or maybe things got as bad as it going to get maybe they're not going to get any worse maybe we'll look at this is the the abyss and we did not go down more out of the truly nuts\nAnd I I thought it was interesting that when ... got to be\nA concluding line he said well the Republicans didn't believe her eyes so it's a strange politics of\nSexual harassment and the me too movement for democratic uh cones was clearly signaling that he didn't believe these allegations otherwise he would have been objecting to the treatment but he prefers to say the Republicans didn't believe her so there there's this weird environment where we're living in instead of just saying look\nSexual harassment have a right to be heard not to be believed by everyone has due process rights in fairness right\nBut for some reason a lot of the Democratic members can't get themselves to say that 'cause they don't want to appear that they are or anything but totally in favor of\nThe me too movement and I think that ultimately this hurting me too movement a bit uh I think that it's clear that this final allegation did undermined the previous to our luggage\nAnd in the big picture to win Susan Collins gave that comprehensive speech\nShe didn't say I'm voting because I'm a Democrat or I'm ... and I'm a Republican I'm going to she used to let me just tell you what went into this let me tell you how I insisted on this let me tell you how I came to this decision\nAnd when you listen to the way she deliberate it it's hard to say well typical party politics I I just don't you you can be angry that it didn't go your way but it's you\nWell do you you can be angry that it didn't go your way but as you see there when Kevin was accused of something that happened Thirty years ago something might have happened Thirty years ago I'm not saying it didn't but when there's nobody they can read the story\nHow can we possibly tell this man he's not worthy of the seat or it's okay to destroy his wife\n[noise] well I I this is the part I wrote a column recently in the hill that we finally reached this level of primordial politics you know we've and that where we engage in\nTotally on limited on the linking rage and ... you know politicians have unleashed this in the age of ... you know they we we now live in a time where people have been given a license to\nBe rage full hateful and not consider any elements of fairness or empathy and there's lots of people that are waiting for that moment we saw that I didn't get to see that on both sides\nBut what's missing here is what you know used to be said about statesman that the difference between a politician or statesman the politicians think to the next election where states and thanks for the next generation where we really found out in the Kavanaugh confirmations are very few states in the left in the Senate to bother you\nThat was me a lot you know I came to Washington as a page a fourteen year old page and\nWhen I was here giants walked those calls you know people like moynahan end and Humphrey and the Javits and others you know they were Republican and Democrat they were institutional is they believe deeply in the Senate\nYou know when I when I handled the impeachment church last impeachment trial or in the Senate there was last judicial translate counsel I remember arguing I'm a part of the case and they took a break on the Senate floor and and center in a way a came up to me and said\nHow so how do you feel that having these hundred senators as your jury unless you know I just can't get out of my mind when I was a page because in a way was there with us page\nAnd I said you know there used to be giants here you know and when I'm arguing these these people they all seem so damn small [noise] and in a week I'd really sort of silent and he said I think about that a lot\nAnd the sentence changed and it hasn't changed for the better um and at some point or and a half to decide if the majority of the American people have had enough\nOf these people on both sides that seemed to be\nTrafficking in the politics of rage\nWell I'll give you an example I was in college who says I have death threats and that people praising me and she does Sunday shows you back away from the decision did sixty minutes\nNow of people say Murkowski you're done no we're going to run against you how dare you vote against them if you want to show that it's a new day and understand it to you or it's only to your best interests to tell mansion Murkowski Collins I respect your decision\nNow you're going to have to earn those Senate votes but don't alienate and vilify this'll be the first test not just from other senators\nBut from politicians and people do not hate Murkowski for not agreeing with your decision or going with her party you harder to make their own decisions while representing your people are and if not as an election don't make her enemy number one\nFor I and I think that is just incredibly well said you know the I I actually wrote a column and Murkowski first came to the Senate that actually criticized her uh being appointed to the Senate and a big uh I I Am because of the\nUh the concern and a half or ... you know that her father was a senator and I never liked the never liked these family yeah I the salmon Lynn itch\nBut I have to admit I and I do so gladly she is one of the most thoughtful senators are in Washington\nI you can disagree with their decision on Kavanaugh but she's one of those senators that quite frankly thanks very deeply\nMost of these people I got to tell you are just greedy actors you know there I you know is the foreman is yeah the worst performance is when they tried to convince us they actually care about this stuff\nBut they're few and I think we're ... does care I really do\nAnything is you you you can't do it by the Democrat too crazy to alienate Joe Manchin chanting shame at him and say and yelling and his party no he's\nRepresenting West Virginia well being a Democrat and if you keep pushing him what is the endgame did he switches parties we wouldn't be engaged with Susan Collins said she never ever deliberate Republican or not what do you want to say okay we couldn't convince or this time maybe next time\nI think that's right and we're going to see another face of this tomorrow perhaps we're gonna see protesters tried to interrupt the Supreme Court proceedings that would be a new low uh you know the ... the ... the the Supreme Court chambers has always been\nA place of considerable reverence they're much more strict in terms of\nDecorum in that chamber room [noise] all of the justices believe strongly in that and we're going to see if this is Rachel environment that we live and will penetrate the chamber itself and it will be a new low if if protesters or interrupt those proceedings\nAnd we heard them interrupted the vote over and over again and the vice president demanding order who's into if we if it does translate to radio I Hope it does these are the protesters swarming the door at the Supreme Court cut thirty\nThree miners happening we\nShouldn't think as a whole building are in a restaurant that you're on the part of it [laughter]\nSo I mean that was it was crazy scene where the vice president walked out he walked back then he walked out again on the Supreme Court steps they were ... Cheney angry things had him so you're you have you've never seen this before right\nI haven't and we were we've lost any sense of control or decorum I've seen it with friends of mine you know I come from Chicago from a very liberal family\nAnd or the rage is overwhelming but what concerns me is I just got back from Chicago and I said this to some of my friends and family\nAre that they're enjoying it too much that they they're enjoying the rage too much there's a sense it suddenly it's okay to say hateful things one person said I really hope that Mitch McConnell died someone\nKilled somewhere he dies of cancer and I said do you do it if I played that statement back to you\nDo you think that you would be ashamed and and she said no and I said that's the point there was a day when we still have the capacity for a shame that that's a shameful thing to say but we've lost that capacity\nWell I mean look at what just happened to me a as I'm walking through the train so I mean that and I actually\nI think that's a great example Brian what happened to you well it's an outrage the fact that there are people that would not only do that but then post it and people would congratulate them me his knees are really horrible people you know there are such things as they are yeah\nPeople you know there are such things as they are yeah the the people that followed you like that are horrible people and they seem to have found their audience and they have a and\nI was giving him so people say well Mitch McConnell you started this when you did not vote with nine months left in President Obama's term at the tragic death dozens of Justice Scalia and this is what you said when you didn't even meet meet with Merrick Garland here's his answer cut their team senator how broken is the SAT\nBeside us all broken away to an attack Merrick Garland a background or try to destroy and we didn't go on a search and destroy measure and we simply followed their tradition and America which is that if you have a party of a different\nA different set out of a different parties and the president of the adult fellow Americans they created and a presidential year that want all the way back\nI'm sending my candidate for US Senate and and I am too many need more by minimum for Arizona\nWe're to talk of the quad cities eleven thirty AM cakes you in a print the valley and on Ninety nine point nine F.

all at the same time we'll get the trade issues worked out China has to work it out we are the largest economy in the world and we're the largest customer\nBut we also have to deal with these other issues and that's why the president the vice president's speech was so strong on that because make no mistake those were the words of President Trump and the policy of President Trump that the vice president was was espousing last week\nThey more now that you're on the outside\nWhat and you can look at the administration away communications has done and policies is implemented what do you what

are doing such a great job and they're working very hard at getting the president's policies or they had acted or promoted\nBut I think the one thing we have to do and what we have to make sure we do in this is true for all Republicans whether you're in the ... the house the Senate the White House\nWe've got to make sure that we were late our policies to real people they don't pay attention like we do in Washington DC and New York to every butter and that comes out of of politics\nThey're busy living their lives we've got to make sure that we connect with people and I think that sometimes

paychecks going up or\nBecause of the low unemployment rate there's never been a better time for you to either go get a new job or having your employer have to pay you more to keep you in your current

myself\nArizona so no I'm prop one twenty seven four\nOr five oh no Arizona the talk of the quad cities cake you in a\n\nYou think this president can be a moral leader for the world I don't know that\nThey can do that because right now that is not the way he is acting given example my favorite three words and our constitution is the first three words we the people when the people but recently it's become mean the president as opposed to any of the people and you're saying things that should not be happening\nSo secretary ... a Republican by name only a who worked for Reagan and Bush and Bush a totally a poor or just to upset the fact that Donald Trump for president and the new way of doing things\nUh gets who else who wants to call the task Thomas was K. S. A. L. in Kansas hey Thomas\nAnd Joe Millionaire show very much better joined us are very much this today\nOh I appreciate your organization has been fantastic for us what do you think about ... is he right [noise]\n[noise] no the way it is the way I see it is so we're the people are at it as constitutional they voted oh are you down of a slave for Donald Trump so far we the people are satisfied I can say that because he's doing exactly what I voted for him for\nOh he's been forced to the American people there for the way that people for eight years under Obama is the dictator and none of us had a horse so he's wrong as far as I'm concerned also true for justice job and I am absolutely floored\nAs happy to know that the first of all of a stray bullet snakes called the Democrat Party not all just those ones that are being so evil or their teeth knocked down their throats\nOr you know as he was going to happen on November sixth they want to pay pay back the Republicans would see what happens I Know one thing the president smart trying to get Democrats who just don't want to get along\n[noise] yeah I mean listen he sees a an upside you know answering the question like like he did he sees that especially with Republicans who are going to turn out in the mid term election\nOr the fact that he delivered on Brett Kavanaugh and he got it across the finish line and and the senators did\nA is a is a big win for him\nAnd you know you wouldn't know that if you looked at the week of coverage of it but once it happened I it was a promise delivered\nAnd it was one in which ah especially evangelicals and conservatives are conservatives all over the country were really pushing for\nYeah it's just so interesting because yesterday last week while you're away maybe it was a coincidence but I think there's a lot to do with you being away they cut a new NAFTA deal because you were standing in line everybody knows that new NAFTA deal they could they got together and opioids\nThe president has ramped up his rhetoric against China which even unites him with Democrats on that initiative and with a lot of the EU\nSo now we're getting closer to a bilateral with Japan\nAnd you have a a Trump like reader emerge in Brazil\nSo there's a lot of people who are saying wait a second\nThere's a lot of dominoes falling in the president's direction right now with on the economic numbers would even through a hurricane or the unemployment dropped now the three point seven percent and they don't have access to that yet and the fed raises interest rates\nBecause he feels the economy is healthy for the long term kinda hurts the economy a little bit it hasn't stopped Colin Powell for a for ... for taking a look at what the president has created I Want to hear what he said they're free to carry a cut thirty nine\nAnd so America has to take a hard look at itself and especially in the Congress take a hard look at yourself and see what we are doing to try to keep things things forces in check and put America back in the middle of all this as opposed to being sort of a reluctant player and trying to pull out of very much rather than helping like new agreements\nAnd you know he went on to say they do all were hurting alliances were insulting allies\nMaybe if you look at it on the surface but what he does he pushes back he says he wants to or we can figure but he doesn't alienate but I think his unorthodox approach is just never going to resonate\nLet alone success or failure with people like Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright and maybe the George ... of the world who used to doing things with certain way\n[noise] so I think you're right and it's definitely not a traditional way for diplomacy or dealing with trade deals but over time um some of these deals are you big ones have come across and have you know I mean the the Mexico Canada thing was\nAnd have you know I mean the the Mexico Canada thing was huge\nUm deep south Korea deal on the precipice of Japan or who knows what you is going to deliver the promise but it's you know if there was a new new deal I'm\nNot saying that they are all to the benefit of us to reach structuring deals based on his problems with how they were structured before you know the devil's in the details but um I think a lot more people are looking at it and saying it's an orthodox but might be working\nAnd yeah I mean here's what I what I find is so interesting is that because he's Donald Trump they don't even give it they don't even attempt to give them the benefit of the doubt and I was one of the people read the Woodward book\nAnd I'm reading this and he's sitting down with generals hey telling the generals including that is hey guys you would do this for Seventeen years why making me think more money into this tell me about a plan that works come on army tell me to tell me you got to plan is going to work\nSo it's characterized as the president doesn't respect his generals\nWhat it is is a CEO going up to his brother his division presidents and saying produce more Steinbrenner looking at is hundred million dollar Yankees in saying winning by three games is not enough or trailing by three is not enough he wants to get more but not everyone says well how can you be so disrespectful of the military\nBut they people aren't even open to we might some of the so unorthodox way of doing things in politics\nMight be necessary does that surprise you\nKnow listen I'm ... people and we traveled last election twenty sixteen\nOunce around the country people or most that we heard the most from or people that were sick of both parties they said Washington doesn't work it's trying to kick the table over and try something different well this is something different\nHe operates in different realm she uses Twitter says things that don't you know it's not comfortable but\nThere is stuff that is happening we cover the iceberg that's on top of the water and the controversy states day but there is a huge iceberg of changes happening in Washington and different agencies including the Pentagon um that often don't get coverage\nYeah it's in the you know now he seems to have more of his people around him that might say oh instead of judging him works with him instead of saying why the wise you know fly off the handle wise you want to do five things at once they go to that I Know that guy that's what he always wants to do this what you do is they handle it you don't run to the Washington Post and say\nInvoked the twenty Fifth Amendment I even sense\nThat it's the way we spend the whole thing with a Rosenstein is working he let him out let them calmed down and let the story die a little bit and then they're going to go talk Rosen someone to talk right away that's kinda the way it works in business in our business especially\nYou know you're not getting the stories you want you're not getting that your your case right 'cause you get all the stories you want to be able to talk about this sort of Sudan so maybe a maybe a new direction is a little upset you know knows you a little upset gives you a week or two to cool out then you bring him in office on your to an his time or time and then you talk it through like we're we're used to this world\nBut in politics they handle it just totally differently and and the president's not bending he doesn't care if it upsets people\nFlagged as clear clear\nHe does not care if he upsets people and um and we'll see we'll see how the country where ... uh the next you know barometer that we can really measure is November sex and it'll be fascinating to see if if what Democrats are predicting um holds true or if\nThese numbers really don't line up to the sentiment of how people are looking at their own personal economy and the state of the nation\nI'm going to give you a good question for tonight or tomorrow that I think is really gonna work out for your panel I'm In Florida
