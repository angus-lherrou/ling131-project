the president he's not looking at the relation between the two he's working a live audience who waited a long time to get in\nAnd he was just talking about what a local politician did that was brought

half an energy has had a quick Saudi saying you're you're ... you're right about that is terrible about killing women and show but look at it and the ... John McCain was a baby killer\nAnd they were at a screaming about him dropping bombs on a on a on a Vietnamese you know everything's just shame Brian I've been on the street for Thirty years you're going to find out all the Paso a chair you're sitting in how you come across\nWell thanks a lot about what happened is of course the Vietnam War there was a draft there was a lot of resentment for that war and they started getting mad at our airmen the air force members as well as\nA our army they say well you're killing kids because a lot of the video images brought back with that but that wasn't the reality on the ground if things had happened more casualties of war and hopefully we got past that period but they work or talking about air force pilots as doing that\nBut no one ever thought um is it that I cannot justify what happened Saudi Arabia that's not going to be okay they will receive ramifications for this and on top of that the president's already made it clear um that he died they know it so now we got to figure out how the Saudis are going to own up\nTo it when we come back we're going to be joined by Katie while I'm In the city spokesperson for the department of homeland security she knows the loopholes in the catch and release other reasons behind this caravan as so many problems that are voter shows for\nIt's a great topic and it's a great issue for him would come the midterms but you're saying on the ground when everyone's focus on these caravans you find is relatively aggravating because don't focus on the care of and the Caribbean is just one issue\nDating because he'll focus on the care of and the Caribbean is just one issue you're dealing with that on the border on a daily basis and your feel helpless\nRight now you know we're seeing a caravan coming towards the United states\nOf about four thousand people right that's what the news is reporting we're apprehending about two thousand on the border each and every single day that's where you know the men and women have CBP and border patrol or apprehending them but there's not much request they can do once they apprehend then were forced to release because not only are detention centers\nFilling up but then even if we do you know keep the family and it's in detention we can't do anything with them is twenty days is too short period to be able to adjudicate and removed from our country the best attorneys removal and we don't have that ability right\nNow do you think the word is out on these loopholes in central and South America\nOh these smugglers traffickers no our laws better than members of Congress\nI mean it is the most shocking side I've seen recently\nUm is that you know from two thousand sixteen to now more men are coming across the border with children than ever before you know and twenty sixteen it was about six thousand men came across the border with children today it's up to sixteen thousand which says that people know that if they bring a child you will be released in the United states\nAnd there's little or no chance for a move all\nSo I Want you to you David to a forest said on TALK or the other night uh he's a former President Obama's State Department official\nWe're talking about illegal my immigration rights and illegal immigration gone down for Mexico and they couldn't go down for Honduras and Guatemala and other countries in Central America we improve those economies we only give a little bit of money to help improve the economy I mean are they really are going to leave him there and we need to pay more\nSo you heard soccer's sarcasm but that is the feeling that if we do give these people more a big stay home\n[laughter] you know the number one and number two reasons\nThat you know border patrol has found when they interview folks at the border to come to the United states you know what's driving them number one is reunification and number two and economic opportunity that is not because they feel unsafe and not because the economy is not great it really want to come to the United states\nYou know if if you're truly thinking you know ... if you're ... persecution and your fleeing no reason why you cannot remain in your home country why not stopping Mexico but they don't stop and Mexico they continue on to the United states you know I was just at the border a couple of weeks ago had a chance when we apprehended a family unit you ask why are you coming to the United states\nI'd like to meet up with my brother who's living illegally in Richmond, Virginia\n[noise] wow\nSo working that's what you're seeing so drawn him oh good good ear as his um he he is Mexico's investments in the United states he was on our general yesterday I Want to hear what he said about the caravan cook twenty two\nWe have evidence that or this carbon is also very much for your call the motivated so we're not we can your sense of the humanitarian situation than we encounter and we're acting precisely\nWhat we we have also made very clear that there is no legal ground on which Mexico than usual ferment by which the movement jokes go through Mexico for wars or you know those things\nSo but they do they let them through and the care of in some of that has been sponsored by some enemies of our state but on both those issues first off who who put the care of them together\nI mean this camera and is being put together by NGOs and others\nUm mainly for media attention I mean as I said we're seeing caravan size every day at the border you know we've heard reports of these folks getting on buses and then getting off and walking for the camera is\nYou know they are getting a ton of media attention and it is at least putting a spotlight on a loop holes the serious loopholes in us immigration law that once again is you know at least things flash on everyone's TV screen to know just what a crisis that is at the border day in and day out\nCan Mexico do more\n[noise] you know Mexican ... Mexico's definitely taking steps to address the humanitarian issue but yes you know these Mexican cartels control the entire U.S Mexico border I feel comfortable saying that you know predominantly\nYou have to pay a smuggler or traffic or about five thousand dollars is that going rate right now to get across the U.S border\nSo there is a two point five billion dollar industry for these traffickers they smuggler these cartels to get people across the border illegally that is happening in Mexico right now\nYou are speaking to you know a kid he's dealing with this on a regular basis or we have a duty woman here the spokesperson so Dianne Feinstein does not only does she not regret the two thousand a law that pushing for central and south Americans to come here and stay\nShe says if she if she gets her party gets empower the she put on fixing the law or or and bring it up\n[noise] you know I'd have to say that we really do need Congress to act in a closed these loopholes because if not if you just continue to see more of the same that is four hundred thousand you know I just said that a hundred thousand people apprehended at the border last year they're all here today burning continue to see it as an influx\nOf family unit an influx of unaccompanied alien children because if you keep screaming we're exempting you from the law work exempting you from any consequences you're gonna continue to see people come in and it's up to Congress now to close loopholes\nJudy I just don't understand if the if the Democrats see this happening it's not good not a good issue for them to let people think that people can put our borders and get into our country so why don't they want to fix this I understand that they have to think for the wall they don't want to get the president a victory but why don't they want to catch and release\nIt seems like common sense to me but maybe it's just a fundamental misunderstanding of the way US law works I mean to me it makes perfect sense that if you have a you know a crisis going on at the southern border you'd want to fix it but that's a great question for Dianne Feinstein\nWhich she says that you would like to even make it easier for people to come here illegally right\nI think so yeah\nAnd do you feel as though this has been defined well in this in this political process in this election season\nI think we need to as much as you can and much as your listeners can\nReally get out there and educate on what actually is happening at the border because it's not just four thousand people today it's two thousand people every single\nDay and it people we can't remove and then it ice going out you know into communities and putting themselves at risk and ... ... every day and go out there to keep our communities that kicked drugs off the street and it really is an effort\nAnd educational effort to help everyone understand what is happening at the border and why we really do need Congress to\nStep up and three there were three border patrol a soul to over the last five days so the the danger is real and last week for people listening for those who say well you know Katie Waldman a brain to me there talk and they don't have big hearts these people have horrible lives and we should just give them a shot how much of our tax dollars do you want to pay\nA ... there are people in this country who are worthy of help from the government\nHow can we possibly sustain our country if we have to pay for everybody to come here is ... not sustainable we will not be the beacon of hope and democracy because we're going to collapse from within were running on a ... basis a deficit of seven hundred\nAnd fifty billion dollars how much more are we willing to spend for people from other countries\nThat's the question that has to be asked to tell me do we all have to work an extra day for people in other countries when there's people in this country\nWorking extra day for people in other countries when there's people in this country that need so much\n[noise] you know Brian we sent thirty three thousand dollars a year per unaccompanied alien child in that country there's Thirteen thousand unaccompanied children ha chatty Cathy right now that money could be going towards grants\nThat money can be going toward inner city schools that money can be going toward Medicaid

I'm I Know it's not going to wash with Republicans and Democrats in the house listen to what Lindsey Graham told us\nHow do I engaged Saudi Arabia when India and the ... the leader of the country and just spray and destroy disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for here toxic there's no way we can move forward uh I don't I Would suspend armed hills as long as he's in charge\nSo go ahead and we all heard we all heard that wouldn't Lindsay said those words on Fox and and they went viral in the world I have ... said\nEvery Arab is listening to what Lindsey Graham said and we didn't we we hear him saying you know that this there must be accountability uh I I think you're right that in a house and Senate um that people are angry about this I think President Trump understands that there's a lot of anger out there [noise]\nUh but but again it's it's it's not that this was a A R\nAgain it's it's it's not that this was a A R R guy at the Washington Post ... it's that he was living here as a as a rests on an ass a chosen title to certain protections and uh we didn't take that seriously and get to the bottom of what happened what was the breakdown why didn't we know more\nAs as he is he walked toward that conflict or from which he would never merge why don't we know more\nThan you in your column today go over some of the questions you want answered for example did you know you want to know if our intelligence agencies knew that he was being targeted pursued like this new that they could so he was actually in danger like he was us ... do you\nDo ah the ... there are two possibilities one is that we knew and people didn't act in a timely way of what they know and that really bothers me but the second is equally worrying and and that is that we just don't have visibility into Saudi Arabia and here's this\nGuy was powerless president loves them and then the president's son in law loves them but we don't know much about how he's operating so we we don't have that visibility that's got to be fixed that that's just not that's not a good situation\nFor us to to walk blind and the ... it was as disastrous as a so I think this is what the commercial oversight committees were were were created for his moments just like this they should that should that's a very secret\nI wouldn't expect to hire anybody else in the media would hear about it but I think they should review everything that was produced is ... and I'll take the psychological profile of BS which certainly is a CIA responsibility\nYou know it should be reviewed that would that was a straight up what was the reaction of of people in the White House when they were when they were told us caution this is a volatile personality I could go down the list that Brian of all the questions I think should be\nShould be asked again there should be asked to private an ass and a bipartisan way but this is one where we got to get it right\nYeah I don't don't be fooled again you're not in charge it's the prince and you say that if the print is going to be removed NBS who's going to be removed you say in your last bullet point in your column\nThat they are that the people are rallying around prince ... bin ... and the the last remaining son of the founding king or a king Saud so he and do you think that might actually be a change in leadership because of that\nI think it's way too early to say that uh I just think that that our intelligence agencies should be should be doing due diligence to see what's what's going on [noise]\nUm this is a moment we're in truth is king Solomon not MPs who's running the show he has in under the Saudis system absolute power\nAnd he can make decisions as he sees fit and if he decides that the king and its future are in jeopardy or with the current leadership under him he's going to act I mean the one thing I've seen of the studies over many many years of watching them\nIs a theory and how to play the politics of survival\nAnd you know sometimes I make pretty cold blooded decisions so um you know king Solomon is a person to focus on\nPrince I'm at a I have missed it and there are other uh surviving sons of through them including some on [noise]\nBut but prince I'm at is the one who um all the Saturdays I've been talking to us two weeks or you know he's a person and we think represents the values that can come on some of those it doesn't I don't get me wrong abroad is not a big movement facade is being very\nCareful there was just watching the way David but they're waiting for us\nIt's interesting and we're waiting for them to do their own investigation even though we probably have all the answers already\nWe have a lot of answers but they need they as they eat on it you know for it to go forward as a country that's going to war they need to own it\nSay that if you put thought into that type of thing that would actually a sweat the type of thing the come out of this investigation is actually a ... wage Democrats and Republicans in the house and Congress\nSo so I think this is a rare moment you know we've had these very partisan into into ... and the house of Russia\nYou know let's just put that aside for the moment at let's say agree that we ... we have a big national interests are our efforts to challenge Iran which I think are good and on Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia strength so we we we got I got it right I think Democrats or Republicans are are going to agree on that so\nThat that writes starting point is to have a solid foundation of intelligence about about the place that people and the policies and everybody I think can agree on that and I ... I Hope I Hope the White House would supportive and say yeah we agree with this this is the right\nTo the right starting point you know the Saudis have to their investigation but this one we have to do\nA size it's not it's not a partisan issue shouldn't be a partisan issue\nI lastly I think you the listeners need to know\nHow well this administration has been working with Saudi Arabia to achieve mutual goals on like the previous administration there rolling\nSo we're helping them with the who the rebels supported by Iran where we are the Saudis are helping us to help bring Iran to the table by hurting their economy but they can and the end result would be starving Hezbollah Hamas\nUh then maybe settling down in Syria and the Israelis and Saudis are working together under the wire like they never had before so there is a lot at stake here by misstated anything\nNo use everything you said is correct or we have a lot of interests in common with with Saudi Arabia and as you say is the Saudis are beginning to help us see a world where Israel is part of the region that Saudi Arabia lives and that's really important [noise]\nBut this one has to be solved for all those good things are going to begin to crumble I fear and data that's why we need to take this seriously\nAnd that's why we have to read your columns because your contact through as good as anybody in America overseas in in the middle east because we've had so much conflict over there in the past David thanks so much ...\nYou gotta ... best selling author to a lot of his books become movies one eight six six moral eight seven six six nine when we come back we're going to finish up your calls were thrilled to be the beautiful studio the ws J.

and it is proper to condemn the show humor is totally a proper the question is after the condemnation what is it that you want\nThe loss of the moral big picture is very disturbing\nThe enemy at this time is not Saudi Arabia\nIs a profoundly flawed ally when you're fighting evil you don't only have allies who sit down and read the federalist papers daily\nRight that's the way it works\nThat's part of the reasons that I find that so disgusting that adults believe people were basically good it's a five year old believes that it's excusable ... believes that he's a fool\nThe same people who believe people were basically good get all all frazzled when there is no when when something bad happens oh gee where did that come from\nLet's let's cut off farm sales that way we can strengthen the Iran which never kills people like to show the [laughter] ... bought I got a good chance to feel good about myself I Am cutting off sales to Saudi Arabia\nMhm\nThat's like the condemnations of Israel which is hardly a Saudi Arabia right it's all it's an ally and it's a\nAnd they they they have this proportion at the same people with the on the show issue all the ones who are this proposal Israel's disproportional response that not everybody there are some people\nWho have their moral compass right and I don't want to say again that murder of cars showcase despicable in life the question is not only correctly labeling bad acts as bad acts it's what do you do about them afterwards\n[laughter]\nThat's not the way it works on ... in the real world\nThe real world is not pleasant\nHaving the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally troubled themselves and in this case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place
